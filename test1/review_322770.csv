110655827,"It's rather nice looking, you can feel some artist's pawprint in the skeletons with prognathic jaws or tiny archers hiding in oversized helmets. The gameplay is ok. You have to hit the enemies in their unarmored bits, and while they're not very quick, it's still a challenge in VR. There's the expected sword, shield, bow, further in the game you can also buy a two handed axe or a better sword. There is no spell casting, but near the end you get a magic wand. Levitating mages, and archers in unreachable spots, do force you to switch away from melee. There's the usual breaking of pots to find rupees, and some hand climbing on hanging chains, as in other VR titles, to reach secrets. The cover picture is a bit misleading, as nothing is even in this style in the game. Though you sport the exact same weapon set as that person. Also, I don't know who copied who, or if it even comes from a third game, but the ore mining is eerily similar to the one in Vengeful Rites, reviewed above.

My biggest issue with this game and the reason I am thumbing down is that it is way too short. It feels like there's only one level! And then a second level which is only a single arena room, with a handful of waves. I know VR games are usually shorter than flat games, but at 3hr long this is really stretching too much. Or too little, rather. I heard you can continue the adventure by buying the DLC, but that feels deceitful."

108970198,"Бродилка-файтинг. Потрачено 76 минут. ""Рефанд""
Играл на сложном режиме (здравствуй школа фехтования). 
Ты живешь 2 пробития.(постепенно я набрал еще +30 хп на 3 хита). Враг живет 10 и более. Щиты здоровые - защититься проблем нет, но пробить сложно. Удары, независимо от скорости, размаха, т.д. т.п. наносят 4 хп урона.
Данжи узкие, пройти мимо противника нет возможности. Потому приходится бить всех подряд. Это не сложно, ведь мозгов у врага мало и он нападает по одному.
Лучники на открытых пространствах - ублюдки мелкие. Лук сложный. за счет необходимости уклонятся от стрел. Редко появляются по одному, и обычно их не меньше 2-х.

Всего 7 разных противников на 76 минут. 
Боёвка примитивна. 3 типа оружия (посох, меч/щит, лук) и ""интерактивный"" факел который поджигает многие объекты, чем можно пользоваться в бою.

Экономика всратая - топ меч 1500 золота, хилка на 20 хп (2 хита) 100 монет. лук 300-500, посох 1000. других товаров и не вовсе. с бота падает в лучшем случае 30-50 монет. Если выпадет вообще. Но нам дают возможность зарабатывать - кирку в руку и пиздуй в шахту хуярить золото. Очень интересно, мне понравилось! [spoiler](нет)[/spoiler]

Стишки имеются, простенькие, только для знающих английский. Озвучки нет.

Игра тухлая. Графики нет, звуков ударов 3 штуки, противники стоят на месте и не двигаются почти, прокачки нет, экономики нет, музыки нет, истории нет... как и зазря всратых 76 минут. очередное ебучее ""инди""."
108934029,good
108488705,"Очень простенькая и неудобная. Прошёл, так как вернуть уже нельзя"
108393200,"even with unreliable responses from Oculus Rift controllers, this game may still be worth your while, if you can suffer the aforementioned issue."
108342297,Best £1.54 I ever spent lol.
107840453,Too buggy to enjoy. My sword disappeared from my hand. Died without it and loaded the last checkpoint. Sword still gone. Gold on the floor can't be picked up (HTC Vive). Breaking Jugs/Crates gives you gold but it doesn't fall to the ground and instead remains floating. Same for enemy loot. Luckily this bug prevents the other bug so at least you can grab some loot. Combat doesn't feel great. Blocking is decent but attacking feels very stale. If you do a wide swing of the sword it doesn't matter it'll only ever hit one target. Was hoping for a fun RPG but everything felt very basic and cheap. Most fun I had in the game was grabbing the rope and climbing. Bought it at 2 bucks so I won't refund it in the hopes that it gets a major update and becomes playable.
107805846,"I got this game on sale long time ago, when I started it feels a little too scary for me, maybe because the music is very good :) but lately I was building my courage playing co ops with friends so I gave it another try. It wasn't scary at all, I was just a little chicken haha. The graphics are very nice, I usually say this, it's about how graphics make you feel when you are in VR, and I was immerse and happy with it.  The story is very nice and I didn't feel lost, I got most of the achievements but I will get back for more and try the hard mode path. The normal mode is very simple, the combat is not complicated at all, weapons are working as intended, changing weapons is not very easy since you need to look down, but I decided to choose one weapon per fight and I was able to enjoy all of them.  I didn't experience any bugs.  I played with Index controllers.  The enemies are very nicely design, the sword fight is clean, you can block the incoming attacks depending on the animation, same with casters and archers, you can dodge the incoming attacks moving your body to the sides, that is why I felt it was very immersive and perfect for VR.  There are not a lot of jumps, in case you don't like scary things. Very nice game for the price and time when it was released. There is a DLC (chapter 3) that I added to my wish list.  There are some combat but also some collection of items involved bringing a nice balance of action and discovery phases.  I wish it was co -op :)"
107435051,In 2019 this was probably cool as hell but in 2022 it seems dated. I bought it for 1 dollar so I guess I can't complain.
106953696,"It's okay at best.  BUT in for 2022, it is not very impressive.

It took under 2 hours for a VR veteran to easily beat.  It might serve as a nice intro to VR but it lacks a major comfort feature for new players: HMD directed movement.  I got it for 1.99 on sale and I only kinda recommend it at that price. Otherwise skip this for something newer and with more content.

"
106904440,"a very lukewarm pass.

the game is vr ancient history and it shows, but it is full of good ideas. too bad that devs choose to say ""we're done here"" with just two levels that can be completed in a couple of hours total.

there are two more levels in the dlc that is not discounted. maybe for 1.50€ like the base game i would have bought it, but asking full price for that is insane."
106862080,"Petit jeux bien sympathique en tant que premier jeux VR a l'épée et arbalète, pour 2€ franchement ça vaut le coup d'oeil mais je sais pas si il vaut plus, 1h de jeu et j'ai l'impression d'avoir quasi tout fait ! Sinon le reste est simpliste mais fait le taff que ça soit au niveau des animations et des textures. Les coups à l'épée sont plutôt correct et le bouclier qui est utile, C'est un oui, mais pas au prix fort !"
106736331,"Love the graphics and  visuals. The art style is reminiscent of old school high fantasy, and the ""feel"" is like the DnD comics and dice games. The writing is some of the best I've come across. About to do a second play through, so +1 replay-ability. The music is fun and sets the right tone and mood. The intro tutorial area can be a tad overwhelming, and the game play mechanics are smooth without any glitches thus far."
105355733,"Игра после запуска которой захотелось сделать рефаунд но  в последствии она приятно удивила. В первые минуты игра показалась сильно устаревшей (что неудивительно в ранний доступ она вышла 5 лет назад), но буквально спустя 30 минут я увлеченно искал ключи и решал несложные пазлы, и радовался приятной боевке.

В большой плюс хочется записать разнообразие оружия - мечи, молоты, метательные топоры, лук, копье, двуручное оружие, есть и уникальный метательный молот - оммаж на молот Тора который возвращается в руку после броска, и не теряет актуальности в бою на средней дистанции вплоть до финала игры несмотря на невысокий урон.

Кажется именно этой игрой вдохновлялись разработчики Karnage Chronicles и Shadow Legend VR, в Karnage Chronicles особенно много схожих элементов. 

Из очевидных минусов нет ориентации по шлему при движении стиком, только ориентация по контроллеру, что очень неудобно если учесть что обе руки в бою активно используются, а так же множество различных багов и кривой анимации и реализации многих видов оружия (например двуручное оружие использовать неудобно). 

Отдельно стоит отметить один фатальный баг в третьей главе, в этой главе правила игры меняются и при выходе из игры и последующем ее продолжении мы не возвращаемся на контрольную точку, а начинаем с хаба где оракул выдает нам квесты на сбор зачарованного меча (собранные части меча при этом остаются), так вот зачастую при попытке сдвинутся с места нас перебрасывает в совершенно другую локацию, в которой у игрока даже нет ключа чтобы открыть первые же врата, спасает перезапуск игры и быстрый телепорт ближе к оракулу  из этого забагованного места. Баг может успеть сработать даже в этом случае, может понадобится несколько перезапусков.

Еще есть нюанс что финального босса 3 главы можно победить только магическим уроном, а мана здесь реализована как расходуемые кристаллы, и если потратить часть из них до прихода к нему можно оказаться в ситуации что нанести урон боссу нечем. Для победы над финальным боссом нужно примерно 2000 маны (около 30 выстрелов зачарованным мечом, число отображается на нем). Тут так же может помочь перезапуск игры, который вернет вас на хаб и у вас останется то количество маны которое было в момент прохождения предыдущего квеста."
104620854,"Got this Gem on sale for $2.
Feels like i stole it , totally worth way more than I paid for it!"
104324469,"Забавная, легкая адвенчура, геймплей и инвентарь очень хорошо реализованы. Скелеты уморительные, есть боссы! Поиграв еще несколько часов, скажу однозначно: игра огонь!!! DLC взял не задумываясь! Не смотря на простенькую графику, затягивает и не отпускает! Порадовало, что за один вечер не пройти)"
103976024,Sistema de combate interessante para VR
102999854,"Не очень хорошая графика, нету физики, заскриптованность почти во всём, разнообразие противников в виде 3х скелетов с мечем, арбалетчика, 2х магов, и 2х жирных врагов (боссов). В целом, за 43 рубля ещё можно купить, но без скидки... Если у вас глаза не вытекают при виде полного отсутсвия физики и полной заскриптованности боёвки с невнятными хитбоксами, то можете купить – [b]это полноценная игра[/b], а не бесконечная аркада, коих полно.

 Проходится за 2 часа, если проходить неторопливо."
102536248,"Wow, this is one of the absolute best VR experiences I've had so far! This is pretty much like a VR Zelda game (though more linear), which is an amazing gaming combination. Despite having simpler graphics than I expected, this game drew me in just as much as HL: Alyx did, and it was hard to pull myself away from it. The great environmental sound design helps to keep you immersed, and there is so much hidden treasure to look for in every nook and cranny. Plus climbing ropes and chains to find secrets is really damn fun."
102535140,"I picked this up for $2 in the last sale.  It's unquestionably worth it at that price, but I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it.  I'm only a couple of hours in, and I understand the full game takes around 4 hours to complete so I'm probably around halfway through.  Control wise it's pretty straightforward.  It could benefit from a tutorial but it's not that hard to figure out, pretty similar to Karnage Chronicles.  It REALLY could use some more setup options though.  It does offer smooth locomotion, sort of, but it's so slow you'll find yourself teleporting a lot anyway (luckily it's not an either/or and you can do both).  What there is of a story is pretty weak, so if that's your thing you'll be disappointed.  The closest comparison to other VR games is probably Karnage Chronicles, but Karnage beats it out in almost every aspect.  If you can pick this up on sale for $10 or less then it's a definite buy.  If you've already played Karnage Chronicles and are jonesing for more, then it might be worth full price, but honestly there are better games you can get for $20.  If you haven't played Karnage Chronicles yet, pass on this and go buy it, I'd say that's the best VR Dungeon crawler currently available, and it has co-op."
102382880,"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Very nice dungeon crawler with good game mechanics, perfect level building and a little bit of Zelda charm. I will definitely buy the DLC and hope to hear more from the developer in the future."

101791115,"Hübscher kleiner Shooter mit Looting-Elementen und Rätseleinlagen. Grafik ist sehr sehr grob, aber das stört nach einer Weile nicht mehr.
Das Spiel belohnt den Spieler nach und nach, und transportiert die Genugtuung des Auflevelns zum Spieler erlebbar.
Sehr viel  Spaß hatte ich beim Umgang mit dem Bogen. Fernwaffen sind eh immer gut :)"
100799174,"A pretty good short VR experience. Enhance your experience by putting on some fantasy music in the background, because it is sadly lacking in that aspect.

If you want to change your settings, when you get into the pause menu you may have to look behind you to find them. 

Only has snap turn, not smooth turn, not a game breaker but if you like smooth turn you may not like this."
100393685,"Fun game, controls and combat great, awesome environments and maps. We need MORE of this in VR. Great job guys! Make more!"
99888379,One of the first VR games I played and had a ton of fun with it. Just don't forget to keep your eyes open for treasure. You'll need a lot of money to get the good weapons.
99570254,"Really fun game!  I didn't expect much of the fighting mechanics as I had played some so so VR sword fighting games, but it was actually pretty accurate once you got the hang of it.  The graphics were pretty, the weapons were cool, the enemies were pretty diverse.  My only gripes were with the occasional glitches (including some that let you skip portions of the levels, or didn't leave you at the checkpoints you saved at last time).  I also wish it had more of a music soundtrack to it (something Enya-esque would have been fitting).

But overall a really good game.  It felt Zelda-esque, which is always a good thing.  Looking forward to more stuff from these devs!"
99568663,"Simple, efficace et immersif, voilà ce qui pourrait résumer l'expérience offerte par Vanishing Realms.
Découvert chez un ami à l'époque où le jeu ne comptait qu'un seul chapitre, il m'avait laissé un très bon souvenir. Quelques années plus tard, après m'être équipé d'un casque VR à mon tour, je me suis décidé à l'acheter dans sa version complète et je n'ai pas regretté mon achat.
Certes nous sommes loin d'un Skyrim VR ou d'un Asgard's Wrath mais ce n'est pas le propos de ce jeu.
Simple dans ses mécaniques, dans ses graphismes, dans sa narration, il n'en demeure pas moins efficace.
Sorte de Zelda aux graphismes à la World of Warcraft, Vanishing Realms sait nous transporter dans son univers médiéval fantastique, nous faisant parcourir donjons, châteaux, mines et autres forêts armé de boucliers, d'arcs, d'épées, de marteaux, de haches et d'autres équipements.
Attention malgré tout, le jeu pourra paraître mécanique et répétitif dans son déroulement, il est dommage qu'aucun personnage non joueur parlant n'ait été prévu, ce qui aurait contribué à le rendre plus vivant.
A noter aussi un passage de combats en arène au chapitre 2 qui fait le lien entre la fin du premier et le début du troisième, et qui est clairement dispensable mais malheureusement obligatoire pour continuer. Mention spéciale aux chapitres suivants qui valaient, selon moi, l'attente qu'il ont suscités à l'époque.
Si vos standards se situent plus aisément vers des jeux tels que Skyrim VR ou Asgard's Wrath, nul doute que Vanishing Realms ne saura pas vous contenter, mais dans le cas contraire, n'hésitez pas et laissez-vous emporter."

96682387,"Всем доброго времени суток!
Хотелось поделиться своим мнением по поводу данный игры.
Это полноценная игра,на прохождение которой у вас уйдет примерно часов 5-6 неторопливого геймплея.
Vanishing Realms то весьма захватывающая ролевая игра, которая разработана с нуля, специально для VR.
Сама по себе она достаточно простенькая,без замысловатых механик,но именно принадлежность к VR отыгрывается классно. Нам дают помахать мечом и другим оружием,пострелять из лука и волшебный жезл.
- Разнообразные враги
- Разнообразные локации
- Ловушки и простенькие головоломки
В общем надеюсь мир VR RPG ждет большое будущее.

96354299,"Vanishing Realms is a pretty decent fantasy VR game. It feels like a complete game rather than a tech demo, which is really a plus in this tiny market. It's from the earlier era of VR games, so it's quite simple and short, but still definitely worth your time. There are different weapons, a range of enemies, simple puzzles and an upgrade system. It also has a teleportation system so I can play it without throwing up, which is always a big plus."
95361660,Very nice VR game! I love it!
94354661,"If you ever wanted to play a FP DnD/Zelda dungeon crawler, this is the game! I LOVE playing this! Only wish there were more games out there like it!"
94182116,amazing
93944616,"This game came highly recommended to me.  I was a very disappointing experience.  

This was obviously a game designed in the birth of the VR era and suffers from the archaic control schemes everyone hates,  
The UI/UX is terrible. The movement options lack HMD direction movement option.  There is nothing more infuriating when playing a VR game is having the smooth motion option that is so slow that it forces you to use teleport just to keep you from going crazy.
Almost all VR controllers going forward are going to be utilizing similar control schemes.   Its time to stop using the trigger to grab objects.  It isn't natural and counter intuitive. 


"
93676388,This is without a doubt the best VR game I've ever played. It came out really early in the cycle (I think like 2016?) and it has held up better than any VR game. The combat is INTENSE and the game play is great. Absolutely fantastic game and to learn that it was done by ONE developer blows my mind. Absolutely 10/10 for this game
93478119,I'm a late buyer to the game and like it very much.. The cartoony graphics make me feel like I'm playing a VR version of Capcoms Ghosts and Goblims..The combat is very satisfying with its cool attacking/defence mechanisms.. There are puzzles which are light and help to keep the game flowing for my ageing slow attention span and overall the game has a great atmosphere.. Now for suggestions to make Vanishing Realms even better.. If the devs are reading this please add these following options..Smooth turning and head orientated movement
91753055,"Очень качественная игра. Графика в мультяшном стиле очень приятная, музыкальное сопровождение на высоте. Загадки достаточно простые, но интересные. Боёвка просто шикарная. Рекомендую всем владельцам шлемов VR ознакомиться с данной игрой."
91573333,One of the first and best games I have played.
91113980,"В принципе можно познакомиться. Это такой ооочень олдскульный Dungeon RPG, разбавленный VR-боевкой. Поворачиваться можно не только на 90, но и на 45 градусов.

Боевка на мечах относительно неплоха, если не сильно придираться. Луки тоже хороши. Копье хуже, метательные вообще не смог реально использовать. 

Дополнение к игре разнообразнее чем база, и вроде бы даже больше. 

"
90157565,"It's basically Zelda in VR, in both actual game-play and style, as well as how its entrance was timed during the early first wave of VR. You swing your sword and get the gold. There is no princess to save that I'm aware of. You can find many like games and clones of this that look similar, but are not nearly as well put together as this. It's not terribly challenging, you're kinda just along for the ride, which takes a healthy hour or so to beat. It is important that you play this game first if you really have to do Skyrim VR (mainly out of respect), but otherwise, it's not as 'important' a game to taste today as it maybe was back then, if that makes any sense. 20 bucks is more than fair, but it's one of those games you'd want to stuff into your bag of holding come the nearest Steam Sale. [spoiler]Vanishing Realms. V-R. Get it? No, you don't get it. Pfff.[/spoiler]"
88146628,"A solid VR game, if this was 2016. Its just dated in every aspect and the story might aswel not even be there. Play karnage chronicles instead.

Edit: I have now finished the entire game including the DLC. It gets a bit better near the end but its still the same boring repetitive gameplay."
87561910,"I absolutely love this game. The game play, the story line, everything about it ROCKS!!!"
87537579,"Vanishing Realms seems like what a Zelda in VR could be. Exploration, combat, minor puzzles are well woven together in this short adventure (~4h with the DLC). Given the fact that _one_ person is responsible for this, it's a pretty impressive outlook what's achievable in VR.

Let's break it down:

- graphics: good, but comic
- sound: well designed, good use of silence and noises

- Exploration/leveldesign: The map is a good mix between overworld-thems and dungeons, which never bored me while my playthough. There are some (obvious) alcoves/niches/sideways which one can follow for some loot, food and mana-gems. All in all divers and fun to explore, although superficial

- Weapons: Swords, Hammers, a waraxe, Bows, a Wand (and a shield - which I didn't use at all) - straight forward. 
- Close combat: The combat system shines here - although the shield is completely negligible, as one can parry with the swords/hammer/axe aswell. The hitboxes are on point most of the times, although I sometimes got hit through my sword (could be due to missing tracking of my Rift S aswell). Enemies have their movesets /weakpoints which are easy to learn, but fighting them never gets boring. The variety of the enemies is good, but they're never a _tough_ challenge. 
- Bow: Well, it's a bow. It's accurate, fun, but pretty cheesy. :D
- Wand: This is the deal: Big AoE damage - for a high price. Better collect all the mana you can find. But shooting multiple foes with one blast is worth it.  

- Puzzles: Nothing difficult, but still enjoyable

Conclusion: This game is an enjoyable adventure (especially for younger folks), which drives you to explore, learning the combatsystem and maybe even a 2nd playthrough. It's a well rounded mix of all adventure elements, resulting in a 4h long zelda-esque game - made by one person."
87423161,"Inizio con il dire che ho finito il gioco in circa due/tre ore a modalità Hard senza averlo provato mai prima, al termine della campagna pare che ci sia solo un'arena. Ho anche l'espansione che non capisco come avviare, quando lo capirà la recensirò.

Il gioco è carino anche se è ""datato"", la gestione degli oggetti è macchinosa e prendere e lasciare le cose risulta a mio avviso scomodo, il combattimento corpo a corpo personalmente non l'ho trovato molto divertente.
Consiglierei questo gioco a chi ha già provato molte cose e vuole un gioco in più per passare un po' di tempo, da acquistare solo se in sconto.
Però se non avete mai giocato ad un gioco simile e state cercando un'esperienza profonda, allora mi spiace ma non regge nemmeno minimamente il confronto con il competitor Karnage Chronicle."
87257295,"First 2 chapters are good, but the final one really does take off."
86971032,"This game is just bad. And its not about the design or the graphics(which also feel like a game from the 90's) its mostly about the controls and gameplay. The sword+shield fights are done much better in alot of other games. And shooting arrows with a bow is stupidly bad. I shot archers from a distance where they wouldnt attack(which is quite close) and stood there for a minute pumping arrows all the time bc they wouldnt hit. I am no supergamer but still this is just tedious and no fun at all.
And the whole world feels artificial and why do i have to pay gold for items that i have to solve riddles and quests to get them in a dungeon?
The whole game feels antiquated in its design, vr graphics and gameplay."

84305316,"Good game with fun mechanics, not worth it's price point since it's too small, more on the 8€ side.
Other than play time, it's really fun and the graphics are cool."
83872576,This game works great with a Quest and Virtual Desktop.
83800865,One of my first VR experiences three years ago. A great game to get you started in VR.
83800398,"Will It VR?: It might have, once, but not so much anymore.

Look, Vanishing Realms isn't bad. It's just feels more dated than it should. Locomotion is imprecise to impossible, depending on your VR setup, and the world feels very limited and empty. The puzzles are pretty simple, the enemies are slow and dumb, and loot feels artificial and arbitrarily unlocked rather than earned. I honestly get why people enjoy it, but there are other games that do what it does better, and it's hard to recommend one that left me feeling disappointed.

That said, if this game is really your thing, and you've played through the other VR RPGs, you might enjoy this one. If Steam allowed a middling recommendation, I'd give it here. There are some neat puzzles, and the combat, while not terribly unique or varied, is fun enough to keep you swinging. But if you're on the fence, shop around a bit.

83437922,"This was the first VR game I ever played when a friend brought his HTC vive into the office.  It felt like I was in a real-life holodeck and 2 hours flew by in the blink of an eye.  When I finally pulled the mask off there were many people in the room watching and I was covered in sweat from crawling through traps and fighting skeletons.  I had been completely unaware of my real world surroundings and plugged into the matrix playing.  Now I have my own VR setup and anytime we have friends over, I bust out this game first because they get lost in immersion the same way I did.

Vanishing Realms continues to set the bar for VR games in my house.  Its easy to just pickup and play.  The controls are simple, the swordplay is satisfying, the graphics are great and its just fun as hell.
"
81720188,"I played for a while and was just looking forward to the next check point so I could quit. I plan on giving it another try, but I wasn't having fun. The only good thing was the art style. Karnage Chronicles is very similar and much much much better"
79216682,"Cute old-school RPG with a classic D&D feel. Generic fantasy enemies and cheesy riddles. Thematically it's pretty dull, but using swords and spells and shooting arrows out of trees is a fun experience in VR."
78893785,"Love this game, the extra add-ons are well worth it"
78449083,"I recommend this well-made VR game to my buddies.
I can experience realistic Melee combat against game characters

Weapon and items UI sometimes interrupted me focus on game but It's ok."
78446015,"excellent, sans doute un des meilleurs jeux VR. tres agréable à jouer, très immersif, un vrai régal. Bravo aux développeurs"
77958217,"Vanishing Realms is a really good low cost ""RPG Style"" Single player VR game. Works quite well on my PC which is a bit lower end for VR.(Radeon R7 370). It is actually one of my favourites so far. I hope the developers add more levels. Currently there are two. The story is your a Hero fighting monsters. There is a bit of story in-game basically to tell you what you need to do. Thats all, short and simple. But its great for this game.

Graphics are block style like the kind used in world of warcraft. Personally this is good thing if it lightens load on GPU and allows smother performance. I don't think ultra real graphics are required for VR immersion. More important is how characters interact. Block graphics are not a hindrance for this game in my view

Content/story: Short. One chapter can be completed in a day, or perhaps half day if your skilled enough. There is one goal in mind and the path is set for you - no open world.
AI is fairly basic. Attack patterns are repetitive and each monster spawns once in one one place only. There are no ""friendly"" characters to chat with. Just Follow the path to the end killing monsters and collecting keys along the way to open doors. There is a ""Boss"" monster at the end.

This is a 4/5 game, Great value for money, and not a drain on performance specs."
77779147,"Don't be fooled by the 2019 release date on Steam, this is an old VR game, and you can tell.  For the time it was released, I'm sure it was fantastic, but $20 today will get you much more. This is a lot like a one-player version of Karnage Chronicles -- if you have that, no real need to get this one. You explore a very little, gather gold and occasionally some items to solve a puzzle. Most things are pretty straightforward: to unlock the door in front of you, look in the very next room somewhere to the left or right and find a key.  That's fine.  I think with the teleport movement (which is still wonky and doesn't always work), I would get annoyed with lengthy searches just to unlock a door. Combat is mostly swinging wildly at mostly stationary mobs that will telegraph their incoming blows so you can parry, shield block or riposte. Pick up some treasure for your efforts, hack some barrels or urns with your sword for some copper, mine with a pickaxe for some gold or mana crystals, search for some ""lost"" red chalices (again, in plain sight). Point is, there's not a whole lot here, ultimately.  And when you are forced to use a bow, the game can be pretty frustrating, especially if you've played a more recent game like In Death Unchained, which has very fluid and realistic -- or at least more predictable -- physics.  Vanishing Realm's bow is more like a floaty toy that seems weightless and when you grab the arrow to draw it back, you don't always end up with it.

Tl;dr: not terrible.  I just think it's not worth $20 in late 2020."
77387373,"In 2020 this game is at best an average. This game is or was in development since the early days of VR. I think the developers won´t fix the issues the game still have. It is not a bad game at all but in this state of development after all those years I can´t recommend it. If you have the chance to buy the game together with the DLC my oppinion of good price would be about 8 EUR. But you have been warned. This game is buggy, the enemys are most of the time sleeping and in 2020 the combat is boring. But it still have potential to be a good game. Unfurtunately the developers quit."

Cons:

- Recht linear
- Rätsel sehr leicht
- Keine spannenden Gegner
- Gegner ""warten"" auf den Spieler

Fazit: Die ersten 2 Kapitel waren recht schnell beendet (unter 2h laut Steam). Die Kämpfe haben mich super frustriert, da es super nervig ist, den Gegner richtig zu treffen. Ggf. ist das so gewollt, da man dann im 1vs1 mit Counter etc. arbeiten kann, aber später im Spiel hats einfach nur noch genervt. Quasi überall wird die eigene Attacke geblockt (auch wenn der Gegner da keine Rüstung etc. hat) und überhaupt fand ich die Kämpfe sehr schnell sehr eintönig. 
Für 10€ würde ichs kaufen, nicht für mehr. Ich fands einfach nicht spannend."
72661030,"The game feels very barebones, and definitely doesn't feel like it's worth the price. I was aware that it was short before I bought it; what I wasn't aware of was how disappointed I'd be by the gameplay - disappointed enough to not even get to the purportedly early-arriving ending.

Now, I am aware that this was a pretty early VR game, because I remember seeing it featured in a PeanutButterGamer  video from years ago, but if we're appealing to the ""it was good for it's time"" argument, then I'm just going to say that it hasn't aged well at all in my opinion.
I can't quite put it into words, but everything about this game feels clunky and lazy - graphics, controls, gameplay, level design, animations... I'm not necessarily accusing the developers of lazyness - it could just as well have been lack of experience or a consequence of being a relatively early VR game. Still, that feeling was inescapable for me when playing, regardless of what caused it.

You can probably see that I played this game for less than an hour. I had been trying my hardest to enjoy the game until then, but at that point I realized that I didn't ever want to play it again.
Maybe the game gets really good later on. In that case, I half-rescind my criticism, as some of it doesn't apply to the whole game (although basic gameplay and graphics complaints probably aren't the kinds of things to change halfway through the game). However, the game went on in the way I described for long enough to get me to stop playing, so at the very least you should be warned about that. And, if what I've heard about the length of this game is true, then my complaints are quite likely to still apply for the whole game anyway.

I do have one thing to say that isn't necessarily negative though:
This game would probably be more enjoyable with a really big playspace. If you have enough space to actually walk around within the bounds of an in-game room, and freely dodge incoming projectiles, swords or swinging axes by physically moving without having to worry about jumping into a wall, drawer, or desk, then the immersion factor might, MIGHT be enough for me to recommend this game.
That is up to people with large playspaces to say though, and many of my complaints would still apply."
72544538,"[h1]ファンタジー世界で怪物相手に剣を振り回そう系VR-FPSゲー。[/h1]
物理演算が豪華なVRゲーを遊んだ経験があるとやっぱり見劣りしちゃうんだけど、そうでなければ特段つまんねぇからやるなってほどのゲームでもないのでサムズアップで。


本編だけなら4時間、DLCまでやっても6時間弱のボリュームで、そこそこ長いこと早期アクセスにいたせいで発売日のわりにはシステムがやや古めな印象。

戦闘では剣を振って敵の武器や防具に当たるとガキンと弾かれた音がして、1秒ほど自分の剣が半透明になり判定も消える。なので防御の上から攻撃するとプレイヤーの腕はすり抜けて敵の胴体を捉えているのに、その頃には剣から判定が消えているので当たらない、という処理をしている。

燕返しのような素早い切り返しの連撃を行ったところで一発目が盾に当たっていると二発目は判定が復活していないので無効になる。また地面スレスレの横薙ぎは防がれないはずだが、腰から下には喰らい判定がないのか絶対に当たらない。

そういった仕様を理解してシステム的に強い行動、例えば密着して脇腹を刺すようなムーブをするとヌルゲーになる上に、剣と盾で戦うヴァーチャル体験からどんどんかけ離れていくのはどうかと思う。DLCだとシールドバッシュで距離を離してくる敵もいて対策されてるが。


それとプレイ中の大部分はなんのBGMも鳴ってなかったり、剣を振っても効果を及ぼせるものに接触した時にしか反応がなく、壁や床はスカスカ抜けて手応えがなかったり、悪くないんだけどもう一歩感がつきまとうゲーム。素材に合わせた音を鳴らしてコントローラを振動させてくれるだけでいんだけどなあ。

72314158,"I would love this game if it had free locomotion instead of teleport and i didn't have to physically turn in the real world in order to turn in the game. Some of us (me) don't have a playspace suited for this, and until it dose I'm giving a thumbs down."

71176828,"Very disappointed in this game and THE LACK OF DEV RESPONSE.  Specifically, the first Chapter is not bad; average graphics and average game play; but Chap 2 is horrible for me and is nothing but an arena wave fighter with 9 fights and if you die more than twice it puts u back to the beginning of Chapter 2...a real waste of time; not fun; and if i had known this I would not of bought this game.  I do not care for wave fights or wave shooters.

I also purchased Chapters 3 and 4 (DLC) as reviews indicate that the DLC is better that the base game.  Dev left a post on the discussion months ago that you can play the DLC without having completed Chapter 2 by finding a file called Hero located in the DLC.  Nope, I cannot locate this file along with a number of other players that are unable to locate the file.  I posted a note hoping that the Dev would respond and help me locate this file so i can play the DLC.  Currently, you cannot play the DLC unless you have completed Chapter 2...the arena wave fighter.  I have been unable to complete this Chapter and as such am unable to play the DLC.

What really bothers me is the lack of continued support on many VR games from the devs.  I can name at least a dozen VR games on Steam where devs have gone silent and do not provide any more support.  If devs stop supporting or are non-responsive to players; why does STEAM continue to keep the item on their store page...THIS IS why a lot of people are now hesitant to purchase games developed by INDIEs.  I sure am and will be very, very selective on purchasing future VR INDIE games."

70862238,this  game is a good time. with many cool sights. worth playing.
70751493,"I get what they're going for with the main melee combat - hold a sword, use it to hit opponents and deflect weapons. It doesn't work for 2 main reasons:
1. This game doesn't care how tall I am. I'm 6'2"" (188cm) and I'm too tall to deal with some attacks when I'm standing, and too short to deal with others when I'm kneeling. This would be absolutely no problem whatsoever, except...
2. Enemies only engage with you at extremely close range, thereby lowering their guard and making the combat-as-intended possible. Again, I think this is because they needed it to be playable for children with shorter limbs than I have, and it's not accommodating for my height. In this range, I really don't have the freedom to use the length of my weapon in order to help me deflect things, which means that if I can't reach low enough with my hand, I simply can't deflect a low attack.

This wouldn't be an issue if deflecting attacks worked like real sword fighting, where I can hold my sword at a shallow angle to deflect the opponent's momentum to pass harmlessly to my side, but this game works on ""hollywood / play-fighting"" rules, where it tends not to detect anything as a block unless my weapon is perpendicular to the opponent's, as if to directly meet the opponent's force with equal and opposite force. I normally never hold this kind of thing against a game (I have yet to see a VR game that supports cutting, in addition to chopping and stabbing), but in this case it does prevent me from working around the problem.

This might seem like a weird review for focusing on just this one single point, but it's the beating heart of the entire combat system, so the fact that it doesn't really work at all is very important. The game is simply not very playable."

69925699,"[h1]Combat feels terrible, and nothing else is challenging.[/h1]

Played on a Valve Index.

Your weapons have no sense of weight, ranged weapons are very hard to aim (even the ones with an auto-aiming function like the hammer you can get in chapter 3), and for me generally fights boiled down to repeatedly thrusting at an enemy's weak point (for skeleton warriors, the right shoulder) around whatever armor they had until they died. Enemy AI is painfully simple, and often enemies won't even chase you down. They'll just stay in one place while you kill their allies one at a time. 

When you're not flailing around, the game is mostly a lot of walking from one dungeon environment to the next. There are puzzles every so often, but nothing that should challenge you unless instructions written in rhyme are hard for you to understand. There's a free locomotion option, but it appears the game wasn't designed around it - I kept getting stuck on random bits of terrain any time I moved off the path. 

The game also made an interesting design choice in that you have to *pay* for all the equipment you need to progress. Loot is scattered all over the dungeon, more than enough to buy all the essentials, and for me it was kind of fun to look into crannies or try to figure out how to reach out-of-the-way treasure. But I can't help but think this is a way to pad out a game that doesn't have much else going for it. 

Vanishing Realms is noteworthy for being one of the first full-length dungeon crawlers. But don't let its novelty distract you from its problems. I suggest you give this a miss and go play The Mage's Tale."

It says something about a flying grasp, and since I can't fly and have no followers who can fly, I couldn't continue.

The problem lies in controls. I was eventually to set it to glide and stick turning. Ran into what seems to be standard problems dropping torches. I was never able to pick things up off the floor though and the known fixes gave instructions that don't match current software. Without the ability to pick things up off the floor the game soft locks at Bonedocks. I'm just not willing to spend as long fixing a game as playing it. 

Played on an Oculus CV1"
68232043,"Tried to play on an Oculus Rift. Environment seemed cool, and I really wish I had been able to actually get into it, but I gave up after a relatively short amount of time.

Most of my issues were with the controls. I could not turn the character with the thumbsticks. This is a problem when you have a wire coming out of your head and need to generally look around. I also very much don't like teleportation movement - I get that it's more comfortable until you get used to movement in VR (which may be easier for some than others), but it makes it harder to get where you actually want to be, especially if you have a small play area.  There were options in the menu that seemed to be related to movement, but I couldn't get them to change, so no idea what they do or if they were supposed to help.

The movement was annoying, but I was gonna try to put up with that because the environment seemed cool and I wanted to explore it. And I would have, but I quit after what steam tells me is 0.2 hours - half of which was spent trying to let go of a torch. 

I got to a second locked door with a torch in each hand, (two is better than one, right?) and a key hanging literally right next to the door on the wall. Cool, I'll walk over and grab it. ""You can only hold one item in that hand."" Fair enough, I'll put a torch in one of the belt bag things. Doesn't work. Apparently you have two belt pouches that can hold 1 item each? and mine were full. Ok, that's fine, I'll drop a torch. Click the drop button. ""Don't drop me!"" Try to drop the other torch. Same message. Cue literally every combination of buttons I can think of to get rid of this torch. Nothing happens. Try to smack it into things - nothing, though that made me drop one earlier somehow. Light some random crap on fire. still can't drop. Exit game.

Again, the areas I could get to looked pretty cool. But I couldn't get more than 15 minutes in because I had torches super glued to my hands. 

So maybe it's good if you can play it? I dunno, but nothing worked for me, so I quit and went back to skyrim vr, where I can at least walk and don't have to turn 270 degrees in real life because if I turn another 90 I'll strangle myself with a cord."

If you want a fun VR dungeon crawler, check this one out.

Just finished playing through the DLC. While the base game is a fun experience, the DLC really blows it out of the water. Cool new enemies, weapons, mechanics and a big new area to explore. Definitely worth it. Base game was an 8/10 for me, with DLC it's 9/10 for sure. Check this game out."

再来说说这游戏的优点，首先画面是比较卡通的暗黑风格，有一定的解密和迷宫设定，难度不大，角色可以在里面使用剑盾斧锤和弓箭，还有火把，可以点燃很多东西，整体氛围感还是营造的很好的，就是流程很短，略微有点对不起这价格，玩了三个小时，拿到宝箱的铁锤后突然没有任何线索不知道下一步该去干嘛了，把地图来来回回逛了好几遍还没找到继续下去的地方在哪，不知道是不是已经通关。

If you are new to VR then you will not go far wrong in making Vanishing Realms your starting point for your ""growing"" VR collection."

Caveat - Took some getting used to the controls with the index knuckles. They have a tendancy to want to drop things in hand, maybe because of the way I hold the controls. However important items like weapons, shields, quest items, etc, cannot be dropped, so it's not that big a deal."

You can choose to teleport, so you will not get motion sickness (maybe only a little, when climbing). You can search for all the candles and apples etc. in the game. Enemies appear big and it is fun fighting them. Lovely game."
62366311,"I appreciate what they were trying to do here.  RPG style game that fully takes advantage of VR would be great. But, this game simply has too little content, too few foes, and the combat leaves room for cheesing the AI.  I finished the game in less than 3 hours."
62259870,Cant believe chapter 3 is behind a paywall. Couldnt be more disappointed in a game I had high hopes for.
62063499,The best VR game! This game is a great standard to beat! Be sure to go back through on Warriors Challenge!  It is quite challenging but fun!
61866738,"This is one of the original games that I experienced with my Vive back in the early days of modern VR.  I've played a lot of VR games since then, but there's still something about Vanishing Realms that just seems finely tuned to VR.  The sword fighting, archery, dodging, and hiding around corners, and just cool ambiance make this relatively short game something I come back to experience, and share with others."
61611609,"I can't believe Chapter 3 is not free.  $20 for just chapters 1 and 2??  Great game, but buying in early access implies the rest of the game will be free.  2 chapters is not a full game, they are too short.  Sorely disappointed!  Last time I purchase something in early access."
61376308,This games fight mechanics were a lot of fun.  First VR game to really pull me in to the point of no sleep. haha
61186944,"This is a short, clean, well designed dungeon crawl. There's very little role playing, few choices, and little upgrade path. The experience relies on the excellent VR features, the level design, and their combined ability to draw you into exploring for gold and secrets while using a variety of weapons when you're attacked.

I'm not really sure how far I am into the game. I beat chapter 1, and chapter 2 (the eponymous ""Rite of Steel""). The game offered me Chapter 3, which I'll jump into later. I'm assuming that's the Sundered Rift expansion that I got in the bundle, but if so, it was only 4-5 hours to beat the base game (and I took my time searching every room, backtracking, working on achievements, and could probably do it in less than an hour now if I tried.

Still, lots of fun and highly recommended as a simple, solid, exploration and combat game. I do recommend a large space, particularly early on, as you'll want to walk around the environments and dodge about while fighting if you can. Over time you'll learn to use the controllers to move too (glide), but it's much more satisfying if you have a large area and can just walk, jump, duck, and dodge without crashing into furniture and walls. I have about 9' x 12' of floor space. That's plenty of room to play, but I find myself leaning on the guardian and recentering rather often."

61133715,刀剑砍杀，感觉很好！
60972430,"I know this is a really good game and I support everything the developers do to make games like this, because we need them. I had to refund because there is no smooth turning option in the menu. It only works as snap turning, at least for me on the Rift S. It's one of my pet peeves about VR games that don't support smooth turning. There is a *blink* somewhat that happens while snap turning too, which is kind of another immersion breaker for me. 

I do recommend this especially for anyone getting into VR, as it is one of the better titles out there. If the developer reads this, I hope to get a response and see the game have a smooth turning option added in a future update! 

Thanks!"
60788182,"Best VR RPG I have played yet. Not just an arena game like the other RPG games I have tried.
This is a legit RPG game with inventory and puzzles."
60728832,Fun game.  Short but fun.  Definitely get it on sale.  You won’t be disappointed.
60726819,"First 2 chapters are ok, but the DLC is great. You now have a map, a quest book, etc... New weapons, different area to go visit... lot of fun... but too short!"
60639993,"A very short VR dungeon game with a lot of fun and charm.

GRAPHICS

The graphics are not particularly the best thing in this game, but they are rather good. Although very stylistic, it fits the old-style D&D type world. 1/2

Music/Sound Effects

The music in this game isn't anything special, but still very satisfying to listen to as it reminds you of an old fantasy setting. This game truly is a VR love-letter to a short D&D campaign. The sound effects by the creatures, such as the skeletons and mages, are very unique and sound great. 1/2

Storyline/Bugs

While playing the game, I didn't run into any bugs, but the game truly has no story. The game drops you into a dungeon and you venture outwards to kill the holy king of the dungeon. 1/2

Pacing

Pacing is extremely well-done in the first chapter of the game, as it has you go mining, fight unique creatures and bone giants. However, the pacing is ruined when you figure out that the second chapter is a glorified arena that I completed in one go (with the best sword in the game). 1.5/2

Gameplay/Length

Gameplay is fun and engaging as you are using a bow and arrow, a sword and shield, and even a magical fire staff. However, the length of this game is where it falls flat. For a 20 dollar VR game, I expect at least 4 hours of gameplay unless the game is truly groundbreaking. It is important to note that the game's first two chapters came out in the first years of VR, so it may have been the perfect price for a game like this. For me, this game took less than 2 hours to complete, while the majority of my time was spent in the first chapter (adventure) and I beat the second chapter in under 20 minutes due to it being a 9 stage arena. 1/2

This game is very short, but is a perfect game to present to new users of a VR system. I give this game a 5.5/10 (Average) and I must recommend it to new users of VR, as it is a fun and easy game to play.

P.S. I must note that a lengthy DLC was made by the developer, this year (2019), that I will be playing and reviewing separately, as it is much more in-depth and unique."
60604417,just gets better!
59535714,"Enjoyed the time i spent in the game, the combat is... good, when you understand it, you just have to hit the enemies where they dont have any armor, it basically negates 100% of hits, and enemies are well covered.

While id say newer games offer more, this is still a pretty good and fun game."
59468184,Great game! small puzzles much combat and exploration.
59268107,好评给第一章，流程线性完整，关卡设计不错，但是第二章简直痛苦，开头就要打9波敌人，虽然作为流程来说没什么毛病，但这游戏的战斗毫无乐趣阿
59209313,"Absolutely loved this game. It kind of reminds me of the N64 Zelda games, but in VR. There are a few different weapons to try, with different fighting styles, plenty of fun loot to collect, and a whole map to explore. It's not the longest game (about 3 playthroughs) but every moment is amazing. This is what VR is meant to be. 

Only negative is that they changed the battle in an update in the last year or so. You can no longer duck and cut the giant skeletons in the knees. It almost seems like they dumbed down the battle a little bit. 

Overall, still a great game. Hope to see sequels soon."
59159240,"Nice so far, only played less than an hour, but will update later."
58994572,"This game is getting pretty old and it really does exemplify the early days of VR for better and for worse. It's a pretty good rpg that shows some of the potential of that kind of game in VR but it is limited in it's mechanics and it is short. If you are a VR junkie just looking to try everything, sure this is a good experience, but there are better games that have come along that will be more worthwhile for most people."
58941202,"I originally played this game on my Vive.  I just revisited on my Index and this is still, to this date, one of the best games I have ever played.  It is currently, much better than most ""modern"" games that came after it.  If any VR developers are reading this; please take cues from this game's developer."
58805012,"Game is good, one of the best rpgs when vr was iniciating but nowadays it feels a bit aged, the dlc should´ve come for free for those who already had the game."
58734226,"One of the great first wave VR game and still perform up to standard with nowadays's indie VR game.

Despite being a short RPG game, this game simply opens our eyes and shows us what a design-for-VR game's full potential. Not to mention that the original creator still manage to release another DLC recently.

Highly recommend people to try this one out"
58681945,"Now with the free expansion and DLC this feels like a complete campaign. There's some fun puzzles, mysteries, and place to explore. The music is great! The combat feels a little old compared to newer VR games, but it's still pretty fun once you follow its pace."

58176339,"Well, what can I say. I've played this game when it was first released and loved it. I've played through again after every new content and even after all this time it's still the game with the most satisfying melee combat I've played in VR.

A big plus is the playtime of several hours. :)"

遗憾的是流程比较短，怪的种类也有点少
战斗部分，弓箭的手感一般，拉满和点一下的效果居然是一样的。。
近战也是，敌人左手盾右手剑，头上顶着钢盔，你从这三个方向进攻基本上都会被挡住
所以最好的攻击方式就是撩阴剑，从下往上砍，或者干脆蹲下砍腿，知道这个诀窍战斗就会变得很简单了
"
57184878,"Really enjoyed this game, and for a game that came out when VR only just started to become a thing, impressive.  

I will be having another play through on this with the index controllers at some point, then I'll probably get the DLC, which I'm happy to purchase ;P"
57180330,"Great sense of atmosphere. Still one of the best VR games today, despite being released at the beginning of consumer VR. The closest thing you'll get to VR Zelda."
56800694,"Smashing my shield and sword together (that's not an attempt at sexual humour) for the first time in this game was a thing to behold. This is probably IMO the second best VR experience available on Steam. Only beaten out by Arizona Sunshine.

If you don't have VR, you probably don't care. And why would you? You're clueless to the excellence that is Virtual Reality. This game is so worth your money on so many levels. Can I recommend this game twice?"
56450639,"Excellent game that show the potential of VR, especially to newcomers."
56421391,Great game. Immersive fun and beautiful.
56399842,"Avec Arizona Sunshine c'est le 2ème RPG vraiment digne de ce nom en VR.
J'utilise pour ma part un valve index qui est vraiment un casque remarquable en tous points et permet de longues scéances de jeu sans fatigue visuelle. 
Les graphismes sont moyens (loin des environnements des jeux non VR équivalents type skyrim ou fallout4) mais sympatiques.
Le scénario est court mais intéressant.
Les combats sont sympas et après quelques heures de jeu on acquière une certaine dextérité, mais aussi quelques crampes dans les bras à force de bourriner.   
Ce qui est nouveau avec la VR c'est qu'on peux tirer des flèches sur un adversaire puis se dissimuler derrière un arbre pour éviter les projectiles de l'ennemi, ça change du tout au tout le gameplay car on est beaucoup plus impliqué (immersion).

En résumé, ce jeu comporte l'essentiel des mécanismes de jeu d'un bon RPG (mana, santé, inventaire, potions...) , il manque les dialogues avec d'autres personnages et surtout à travailler le rendu des personnages et des paysages, très loin du rendu des meilleurs jeux non VR actuels..."
56392410,"loco. motion.
not everyone has a 360 setup for vr, let alone a whole room for it. 

CONS:
there's no turn in the game or any options menu for that matter. so even if you want your main locomotion controller to be your left, too bad. this game was excruciating to play. Ive been following this game for a really really long time, i was so looking forward to it just to find out that these essential vr mechanics are absent. I understand that it might be the feel or playstyle the game is going for but for me it was not fun and extremely difficult.

on top of that, combat.
combat in this game is really lacking i have NO IDEA how people are saying its great. literally the ps3 sports champions gladiator gamemode had better mechanics when it came to speed, weight, impact, better hit boxes in general, and a sense of danger. This game is something else. It's been addressed in other reviews im sure but man the combat feels really dull. It's a slow game with one enemy youre fighting at a time. 

one word of advice for this game, it needs music or a soundtrack or something, on top of the dull combat mechanics, theres nothing happening other than the distinct sound of steel against steel. the ambience and immersion is great, just add some music man, when im playing this game i start to feel like im all by myself.

PROS:
- artstyle is wonderful, i saw a couple playthroughs of the beginning of this game but its nothing like youve ever seen once you witness it in vr.
- uh... immersion, like i mentioned before."
55888699,"One of the first titles I played in the Vive, but as I return to it to start the new expansion, has easily stood the test of time. Being able to shoot arrows and duck behind walls/rocks is immersive and just a lot of fun! Not too complex, but most importantly convincing (it feels so much more natural than ports like SkyrimVR). Simply one of the best RPGs in VR - can't wait to finish the new sections."
55739689,"I've kept coming back to this VRPG more than the others I own simply because it feels a lot like a zelda game. 

It may be easy to spam sword attacks behind your enemies back, but honestly if you're playing it like you're really there then it's a really good game. I wish there was more of this and that around, but Vanishing Realms did a pretty good job for one of the first VRPG's. 

Pros
- pacing
- exploration even in a small environment
- atmosphere
- doesn't hold your hand, you discover a lot of what you can do on your own (like climbing)
- secrets

cons
- frequently reused enemies
- not a lot of music
- no point in health potions or food really. dying just resets enemy health
- enemies don't come at you if they see you, only within a certain distance will they engage



I'm going to use this as inspiration for one of my own VR titles as I think this was a good base. Going to lean more towards zelda with items and world creation though."
55465882,Still one of the best VR games out there
55397645,"SO FRUSTRATING AND NOT IN A FUN WAY. For a game that forces you along a specific path it's really complicated and there are so many tiny details that are so easy to miss. I can't even use magic because I missed and can't find a single key which is the only way to unlock magic in the game, which was a solid 80% of why i bought the game in the first place.
The game itself also isn't challenging at all. There's literally no point in killing half the enemies since you don't get XP and some of them don't drop loot. It's a dungeon crawler with only one badguy at a time, and no danger of death, because even if you die, you respawn right where you died with the baddies still hurt from the battle before you died. bleh."
55382722,"So far the best VR i game i ever played.
Worth the price 100%"
55284586,"Definitely my favorite game so far! I love that there is a linear story-line, and the puzzles and achievements are fun! The combat is simple to figure out, and the inventory UI is great.  I just purchased the DLC and can't wait to try that out!! Great game!"
55227835,재밌습니다. 2시간 조금 넘게 플레이하여 전부 클리어 했으며 PC게임보다는 아니지만 VR게임 치곤 무기들이 다양해서 금화를 파밍해 하나하나 구매 하는 RPG요소도 재밌었으며 적당한 퍼즐 요소또한 즐거웠습니다. 한글을 지원하지 않지만 플레이하는데는 전혀 지장이 없는 수준이고 다만 조작법이 조금 난해하여 적응하는데 시간이 필요합니다. 무엇보다 전투가 아주 재밌습니다.

I enjoyed this and recommend it (barely), because I completed it in around 2 hours. That's not long enough for a game at this price."
54974496,"Tolles Spiel, wenn nicht sogar das beste VR Spiel. Der Preis für die Zusatzinhalte ist absolut angemessen."
54972127,"Both the game and the DLC Sunderer Rift are good products. The graphics is in a ""cartoon"" style, unrealistic, with good lighting effects that make the game both ""light"" and enjoyable. It is not a title filled with complex textures in high definition but it is nevertheless realized with good inspiration and imagination. The Audio is essential, with very few dialogues and a discreet amount of rhyme text, which remains a bit obscure for those who do not speak English well. Enemies and the few other NPCs are aesthetically good. The Interactions and the attacks are limited to few repetitive but not annoying combinations. The maps are well studied, sometimes short but more often with “nested” sublevels or with a chance to deepen and lengthen the game, if you want to discover all the little secrets. The game mechanics are simple but clean and well designed, with lots of fun weapons to use and an  inventory easy to manage.
The game itself, without the DLC, isn't long. The DLC is literally a new game, probably longer than the ""first chapter"". Someone complain that the new DLC is not free. In my opinion the developers have done a good job and have shown that they have not abandoned this title but rather, have developed a sort of interactive story, gradually enriching it. VR games unfortunately cannot count on a large audience. Small jewels like Vanishing Realm are rare and precious. So I was glad to have purchased the DLC, if that is useful to allow continuity in the development of this title. I hope that the developers will not abandon the work and guarantee to Vanishing Realms a constancy that can make it, in the end, a game ""AAA"", long, elaborate and loved.

54967720,"Quando è uscito questo gioco, all'epoca non c'erano molte alternative interessanti. Di base il gioco è molto carino, ma l'esperienza viene rovinata dal tentativo di svecchiare il prodotto con l'inserimento di meccaniche viste in giochi più moderni. Quindi per godere a pieno del gioco è meglio giocare con il sistema di base, il teleport.

Pro:
- atmosfere convincenti
- visivamente carino anche se pur minimal
- compartimento sonoro buono

Con:
- con gli index controller cascano di continuo gli oggetti dalle mani
- se si sceglie lo stick per il movimento al posto del teletrasporto vi incastrerete di continuo su scalini o negli spazi ridotti (problema che si presenta sin dal tutorial)
- sempre se si sceglie lo stick per il movimento, non è possibile scegliere cosa comanda nell'orientamento  del giocatore (se sulla posizione del controller o del visore) , quindi se si muove il controller in una qualsiasi direzione questo influenza la direzione scelta rendendo le azioni molto scomode, soprattutto nei combattimenti.
- quando raccogli le monete compare l'icona (dei soldi) che occlude la visuale.
- potete sventolare l'arma per colpire senza imprimere forza nei colpi tanto farete gli stessi danni.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- in conclusione: (personalmente) mi viene voglia di chiedere allo sviluppatore se sa come si crea un'interfaccia di gioco usabile.

Peccato perché questo gioco ha un buon potenziale, massacrato da tutte le nuove modifiche..."
54934649,"I personally didn't enjoy this one which was surprising given all the good reviews. All I seemed to be doing was setting rugs on fire, no combat to be seen in the early game. I'm hoping I was missing something, but this is currently on my regret purchasing list."

My Initial Thoughts:
I come into this game from a fresh perspective as I have never played it, so paid for the Game and DLC. It was just like buying a new game so I don't have the issues most of the negative reviewers are having..... 
For a 3 year old game I really enjoyed this and can see why it got all the hype back in the day. It does everything you expect from a VR RPG and I think it's had a bit of an overhaul in the graphics department with the new DLC, which I tried to show in this video, but alas this video only features the original game.  I still need to finish it (over 3 hours long) to unlock the DLC."

54871341,"One of the best VR games I've ever played. Thoroughly polished, very fun, had me so hard I completed it in one standing pretty much. Well worth the base price, regardless of DLCs."
54865902,"This is a great game with good combat mechanics, perfect for VR and well worth the price, also with DLC.

Most of the recent negative reviews seem to confuse a single independent developer with a big company. They are also angry about broken promises - that were never made in the first place.

There's a good reason the overall review score is 'very positive'. If you like medieval style melee combat with a bit of fantasy and magic, get this game!"
54861276,"Seems like the negative recent review is due to poor decision on developers part that pissed off early adopter but as far as I am concerned, this is the first real dungeon game that really feel like a good First Person D&D experience. It's immersive, the combat are very fun. It's a little bit on the light side of things but it's a fun experience for pick and play experience."
54860686,"Leaving a positive review to offset the negatives from all of the poor people. lol. 

jk. You have every right to complain if you disagree with a practice. Personally, I think the extra $15 is reasonable. I mean, I think the base game itself is a little underpriced considering the amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of it."
54851623,"It was good back in the days, I waited years for the promised content, only to learn that I have to pay again ? sorry, not for me, release it with DLC at full price for newcommers, but alpha buyers should get it free."
54847201,"No smooth turning, For a game that's been on early access for a while and then released after 2 years one would expect basic functionality with the release version but the developer seems that is too busy charging for an expansion that should be on the base game"
54847183,This was great in 2016 and still looks not bad but its just old now. I jumped in thinking i may get the dlc but nah thanks. Dev charged full price for a game that wasnt complete and now wants to suck more money out of us. Bad form. Complete the game we payed for and then maybe bring out a sequel or go on to something completely different
54844391,"This game is fantastic. It was the first VR experience I had that made me truly excited about the potential for VR, and made me move my setup to get a larger playing area. The DLC is also fantastic. Not sure why people are complaining. It is great, the music and sound is great, and the combat is still some of the best out there. Being able to swing a sword and block and parry - it feels right in this game.  I hope there are more expansions to come. I have played the DLC for about 4 hours and haven't completed it yet."

54837018,"Can I leave a ""mid thumbs""? I suppose not.
The original games good, basically like a first person Zelda. But I understand where these new negative reviews are coming from. I mean, we backed you from the beginning. When you do that, you're SUPPOSED to receive the initial release date product for at least a discounted price, or free. We already paid for an unfinished game and when the actual game is released, you want more... common.
I may purchase the dlc, but let it be known that you guys should feel shitty as hell for sucking money out of people that were  already supporting you all this way."
54836693,"This game was fun and relevant before Skyrim VR and other larger VR titles. Now it has dropped down to being a DLC money grab. I will admit I had a blast playing the original, but this game is just too outdated to be relevant. The DLC should be free, and the developer should work on something else."
54831976,"Similar story to others; early access supporter who enjoyed a few hours in the game, and looked forward to the finished product. Here we are, two years later, and they've taken the game out of early access with nothing to show for it but a new paid DLC. 

Would highly recommend steering clear o this developer, and avoid all early access in general."
54816794,can not belive that i supported this in early access for it to now be charging 15$ for a shitty dlc
54816210,"The game starts off great with the 1st chapter, but you can tell the devs passion for this project faded away after chapter 1 was complete.
The rest of the game seems like it was just thrown together real quick.

On top of that this game has been in early access for a long time witch is understandable. However when the game launched out of early access there was no new content, just  content that you have to pay extra for that should have been included in the base game.

I usually do not leave neg reviews but ethics like these should be questioned."
54814502,"Chapter 1,2 and first hour and 15 minutes of chapter 3 here:  https://youtu.be/cDg1ZLQ8FCU

Well I was certainly excited to see the long awaited Chapter 3 of this VR classic finally here!  I unfortunately did not have a save file so had to play through the first 2 again, but it was like visiting an old Zelda game and brought back all the feels so I didn't mind.  I'm only an hour 15 min into the 3 chapter thus far and can't wait to play more.  It looks to be quite a bit bigger than the previous 2 chapters combined! Seriously I feel like chapter 3 is so much improved over the first 2, it should just be Vanishing Realms 2.

Graphics:  This is a title that really shows off the magic of Low poly graphics in VR.  Yes it's cartoony,. yes some textures can appear flat.  All of that aside it still gives the little kid in me the feels.  Chapter 3 really shines as well. I noticed right away that the sky box was much improved including moving slightly transparent clouds,. a bright moon without the distortion in the first  2 chapters.  The fire looked better,. the enemy models are much improved,. just def looks like an upgrade from before.  

Sound: The sound once again is great.  Great new music !  It doesn't always play which is nice.  Reminds me of playing Tomb Raider when all of a sudden you would walk into a big awe inspiring room and the beautiful music would hit and just give you chills.  The sounds of the swords clanking against each other and sliding across each other are perfect.  it just adds so much the combat that is still,. as far as what I've played,. one of the absolute best combat experiences in VR. 

Controls:  At first I didn't realize I had to turn around in the menu to turn on smooth locomotion.  it is there. it's behind you. haha.  I had tried that option before when it was first introduced and I didn't like it because it was so slow.  Now it's faster now,. but  still could be a little faster in my opinion.  Other than that it's the same control mechanics as before.  Simple and intuitive. 

Game play:  This chapter feels so great to play.  It's bigger, . much bigger from what I can tell.  there are more fun hazards to deal with, new, much harder enemies to fight, new weapons including a super fun throwing spear!  There are a few other additions that are just so fun but I don't want to spoil anything,. well unless you watch the video.   Vanishing Realms does right, what so many other VR games I play do not.  It really makes you use your play space.  You have to bend over to physically pick things up, instead of just force grabbing things,. you can easily walk around you play space to collect loot,. you just pick things up out of your inventory ,. it's a VR game!  No confusing menus that you have to try and scroll through taking you out of your experience.  It's an adventure done right!   I don't know how long this chapter is,. but I have an hour 15 in and only unlocked one of 5 objectives so I'm guessing it will not disappoint me.

Overall:  I cannot recommend this title enough!  It is a VR classic Adventure RPG as Zelda is to Nintendo.  Every new corner I turn, every new enemy I encounter, every new puzzle solved,. it just gives you that great experience to escape out of the mundane and go into an epic adventure in your little 11 x11 ft space!   9/10"
54813105,"Vanishing Realms was one of the very first games that really impressed me on the Vive, and although it wasn't too long of an adventure, it showed me the possibility of the technology. I looked forward to additional content down the road, and considering I backed this as an Early Access Project, I was willing to wait patiently.  Now the game comes out of Early Access, and instead of adding more content like others, they immediately went to a cash grab style DLC. I would very much like to continue my journey into the Vanishing Realms, but I'm tired of end-runs for more cash when I backed the project in Early Access."
54808527,The game's visuals are all from the Unity Asset Store. There's zero visual consistency in design.
54805994,"Don't let the negative reviews regarding DLC dissuade you from picking up this game. It is a lot of fun and well worth the cost of the original and expansion. Cool looking Zelda-like environment, negotiating through shielded fighters, crossbowman, casters, boss mobs, etc. The physical fighting is most fun, having to find week points in your enemies defence to get strikes in behind shields. You can try bowing but they get smart and shield block/dodge them away. There's also traps/hazards too to avoid.

The dev should make the casters more aggressive, most of the time you can just bow them from a distance. Mobs also won't rush choke points it seems giving you a pretty decent chance to recover and heal up, maybe making it too easy? Still, it's a pretty good experience and even a bit of a workout, not Beatsaber sweaty, but still much more active than sitting on your ass mashing a keyboard. I've got 4 hours in, haven't finished the first game so haven't touched the expansion yet."
54794669,什么鬼？两年不更新，突然宣布正式版上市，完全和原来的一样，新内容还要当DLC加钱买。。。
54788977,"Vanishing Realms was my first into to VR in 2016. Today, after buying a full room-scale setup, it remains one of the best implementations of immersive dungeon-crawling in VR. For a single developer to pull this off is great. Please ignore all the thumb-down haters. This is a great game and well worth the price, including the DLC. This also makes a great ""showcase"" game to show off your VR to your friends"
54788861,"wirklich eines der wenigen sehr guten vr spiele, insofern man auf comic-grafik ala wow steht. die ganzen negativen kommentare richten sichj offensichtlich an die preispolitik der entwickler nach wandlung von early access in vollversion... hierzu kann ich nichts sagen, da eben erst erworben.
ich finde das spiel sehr gelugen - eines der winigen, die nicht nur eine demo darstellen, sondern ein vollwertiges vr-spiel im dungen crawler stil. mir gefällts ^^"
54788616,"I'm extremely disappointed of the roadmap of this game. It was in Early Access with almost no updates since 2 years, and the developer announce he was working on additional contents BUT HE NEVER TOLD THIS WONT BE FREE.

And now the game leaves EA ONLY TO ADD A PAID DLC!!!!

It’s not normal to act like this and not be clear with customers that nothing will be added to the game for free.
"
54786281,"Great game, great expansion. Been waiting a long time for this one. You are missing out if you dont give this game a try."
54786169,Development hell cash grab.
54785663,"This was the cream of the crop when VR launched. Not only does it not hold up to games released since then, but, after getting far worse early access support than promised, the game launches with a paid day 1 expansion."
54785621,"The game itself is pretty to look at, has a good style and nice to experience. But the combat is bland and can get boring, but you probably wont feel that because the game is way too short. They are not putting any more into it either by the looks of it, they just release it as dlc. So no, I do not recommend you to buy this game. Maybe when its on sale if you are REALLY into it..."
54785498,"Plays great on my Valve Index with 2080ti.

Being a game producer myself I can say this is pretty impressive for a game built by one person. Having played all the other dungeon VR RPGs out there like Karnage Chronicles and VR Dungeon Knight ...this one I naturally keep coming back to and have since uninstalled the rest naturally over time. Probably because this game has kept me the most engaged during my gameplay sessions and doesn't come with a lot of common VR annoyances found in other contemporary VR dungeon titles. Also that it scratches that Zelda gameplay vibe doesn't hurt as well."
54785441,"Hahahahaha, so many bad review suddenly as the developer ask for hard earn money. The original game was very good quality and everybody loved it and I remember that most people said that they will buy additional content. Here we go, the developer ask for £9.11 and everyone goes apeshit.  Silly rhythm game Beat Sabre release paid DLC not long after came to the market and it's still in early access and nobody moans about that. Just want to say thank you to Indimo Labs that they did not give up and finished the game. I will be buying the additional content as I want to see how the game will finish and want to support the developer. I hope you will not give up and make more great VR games. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
54784727,"I am really dissapointed Indimo.

I bought it under the impression you would finish the game and use original art. 
The store bought assets acted as placeholders in the Early Access build, thats what i thought. 

Now the game exits Early Access and immediatly gets a paid DLC.  Kinda reminds of of ARK.

Oh i love by the way that in order to use the DLC you HAVE to complete the first two Chapters. So you have to complete the ""Early Access Demo"" to access the rest of the game which you have to pay for extra.  I guess its worse than ARK in regards to cash grabbing. 

Shame on you Kelly!"
54784675,"So this game is in early access for years, without ONE content update, and now it got a content update as dlc and is leaving early access without anything new after years. .... thx"
54784345,"I purchased this game back in 2016 in early access.  Back then this was one of my best early VR experiences. I sat down and played it again last night and it still holds up.  I was just going do a quick test but I ended up playing through a good portion of the game again.

VR content has come a long way since 2016 and some of that shows here but the dev has done a lot of work to update things and keep it up to the standard. The latest update works well with my Valve Index controllers and I really like the scheme for combining the trigger and grip for grab and hold.

The inventory system is still better then many newer VR games. It does look a bit clunky with the icons hovering around your waist but for the ease of use it's worth it.

The latest DLC situation bother me. People's expectations are a little unrealistic sometimes for these kinds of projects, This is a small dev and they never release content that isn't highly polished. The base game we got still blows away many other VR titles that cost as much or more. The reality of the situation is VR content is still a small niche and making VR games isn't cheap or easy.

"
54784230,je ne compte plus le temp d'attente pour un contenu correcte et RIEN!! pire !!il faut repasser a la caisse pour avoir un minimum de contenue..... une honte et des voleurs!! de sales voleurs ces dev de pacotille!
54784190,"I'm not sure if Indimo Labs is staffed with idiots, arseholes or both but releasing the last part of the game as a DLC the same day you finally release the game is such a flagrant insult to people who purhased the game in BETA and supported you in good faith.

I hope they enjoy the tiny spoils of this venture because they will see no further cash from my pocket on any future endeavors. Why companies do not factor in ethics and good will as tangible profits for future growth is beyond me. 
Weather or not you Like ""No Man's Sky"" or not, agree with CD Projekt Red's approach to business or not there's no denying the fact that they get the value of a good image and customer relations even if they have to drag themselves out of a grave they dug for themselves.

Bad taste Indimo Labs."
54783966,"This will not be in the typical format as my other reviews, at least not for now, because I have to put this out there along with everyone else: what the developer has done is despicable.

Vanishing Realms is roughly a 3 hour long VR RPG, one that just left Early Access on August 23, 2019 and one that had been in development for a couple of years. This game went over a year without a single update. No word from the developer. Nothing. Unless the forums get cleansed, you can see where myself and others were asking if the project had been abandoned.

Then, lo and behold the developer pops up out of nowhere and says a huge new update is coming. Great! It's not dead! No further details, until it was dumped onto Steam behind a $17.49 CAD paywall and the game then abruptly pulled out of Early Access. It's clear the developer wanted nothing more to do with the project and just wanted to get it over with, so he yanked it out of EA with a last ditch effort cash grab.

There are other options to meet your VR RPG needs; OrbusVR, while expensive, is constantly getting new updates (including seasonal events) without locking things behind a paywall. There's also VR Dungeon Knight and Karnage Chronicles.

I'll think twice before buying anything from Indimo Labs LLC in the future."
54783939,"Sorry Leute, Entwicklung kostet Geld und das Spiel ist noch immer sehr gut. Zudem bemüht sich der Entwickler und daher finde ich, dass für die Erweiterung 10 € okay sind.

Gönnt ihm etwas für seine Arbeit."
54783788,"Having purchased this game originally to play on the Vive and finding it to be one of the better examples of a VR adventure, I was sorely disappointed to see the developer pull the stunt of releasing the final part as paid DLC instead of giving it to all the Early Access supporters.

The game itself was fairly solid for the time but at this point I cannot recommend it, especially given the price."
54783312,The end of the game is now behind a paywall LOL
54782500,"Mechanically a good game, I suppose, but I finally see this out of early access after years of waiting and it has paid DLC that should have been part of the final release. Considering how short the base game is, I am very disappointed. I regret supporting this dev with early access. I will not pay a second time just to play the rest of the game I should have been given with my purchase. Perhaps pick it up with the DLC if both are on sale for more than 50% off."
54782379,"The first VR game that really felt like an adventure.  A little short but the base game was enjoyable on its own.  Considering that, the expansion which doubles the length of the adventure is worth it for another 15 dollars.  Games take time and money to make people, and this dev deserves the money."
54782139,"Es nutzt die Möglichkeiten der virtuellen Realität bestmöglich aus. Obwohl relativ kurz gehalten, ist es doch anderen Dungeon Crawlern aufgrund des Kampfsystems, dass über hektisches Draufhauen weit hinausgeht, und die auf VR zugeschnittenen Rätsel überlegen. Daher unbedingt ausprobieren! Preis finde ich angemessen, im Sale würde ich nicht lange überlegen."
54781995,The last half of the game is sold as DLC.
54781610,"Not enough content for what they charged. Paid DLC in early access. No substantive updates to the original issues on revisit. I would describe this as a disappointing (and possibly even misleading) use of Early Access.

Regardless of game merits I may have overlooked on revisit, I can't support this kind of business practice."
54780913,Als Earlyacces gekauft. Es gab nie updates und jetzt ein dlc! Nein danke.
54780353,I love this game. In my opinion it is the best VR game game of the entire steam store. I cannot understand a single person complaining about the paid DLC. This is a solo indi project which took the dev years. The final product is just polished and perfect in every way. AAA should take note. The original price in EA was 19.99 Euros. In combination with the launch discounted DLC we are talking about 29.98 Euros. I wasted so much more money on games which have been so much worse. Let this guy make his living for god sake. How can we expect VR to survive if we do not even want to pay 29.98 Euro for a game this amazing. The money is way better invested here compared to paying for a AAA port created by a soulless team of a greedy big publisher.
54779820,Paid DLC for early access game :(
54779723,"Waited for the game to be released before I really played it. Now I find out that I have to pay more money to play the finished game.

Very disappointed."
54779371,"Bought this game years ago in early access, it has a promising early access, it was a little concerning that I noticed some graphical assets where bought from various stores (an example will be provided in the end of the review), however considering that this game is being developed by a single developer that is to be expected.
The early access game was more of a demo than anything, waited years for updates to come with a very silent developer which started to give doubts to the reality of this game being expanded further than what felt like a demo of a game. Then finally the game is released from early access but the update to the game is kept behind a paywall as a DLC.
Can't feel but having being exploited.

TLDR: Buy the game, get a demo, buy the DLC get the rest of the demo.

54776089,Seriously? You're leaving early access with a paid expansion? What a joke. Shouldn't have supported this developer.
54775945,"Bought this ages ago at full price because it played so great on my Vive, waited patiently for it to be completed, but now you want me to pay again for the dlc? I won't buy it on principle. You had an opportunity to make something great that would elevate you to the top, instead you dragged your feet and now you want a quick buck? I hope the loyal player base punishes you with bad reviews like this one. Your game is crap."
54775665,"Man are you fucking for real? You dont add any actual content for years on end then come back just to ask for paid dlc as it leaves early access, which btw is bs because you ended the ""early access"" by releasing the rest of the game through paid only content. You should be fucking ashamed

Still a good game but if I could Id leave a mixed review for how Im feeling right now"
54775588,"Fun VR dungeon exploring.  Not the deepest or longest game, but still fun and still looks good too (even after all these VR years).  

Explore a cartoon(ish) colourful dungeon and gather some coins to buy better weapons.  It's not Skyrim, but it's not trying to be... so no complaints there.  If the video previews and screens look interesting to you, then the game is likely for you... the VR is good, with a good sense of immersion, control style options, good bow/arrow feel, pretty good sword feel, shield works well to 'catch' arrows (which is quite fun).

One of those games that works to have a friend (or even pretty young child) that's never played a VR game and they will have no problems getting through the tutorials and being amazed by the world.  

Fun game.  Thumbs up for what it is."

54774033,Paid full price for an early access game. With little to no updates or added content. Now comes new content (rest of the game) with tacked on paid DLC.
54773241,"Purchased the game while in Early Access expecting content updates (as typical with early access games). Find an announcement for a new content update, just to see that the developer, instead of updating the game with it (as typical with early access games) decided to make it a 15$ expansion for a 20$ game that is no more than 3 hours long.

If you are looking for a good VR dungeon crawler that doesn't have as greedy devs as this one, play Karnage Chronicles or VR Dungeon Knight"
54772048,"Simply put, this is easily THE definitive experience to try in VR. I have many many VR games on steam, and owned a vive since launch. I have played this game since its launch as well, and have played it multiple times since then. This is still one of the most fun, most cohesive VR experiences you will find on Steam. The developer does amazing work. This is a must buy VR title for anyone who owns a vive and does not already own this game."

Das Spiel ist zwar auf Englisch aber recht simple gemacht.

Positiv:

Story ist schön auch wenn das Spiel kurz ist.
Grafik ist OK.
Sound und Atmosphäre ist gut.
Die Gegner sind recht simple und die Kämpfe sind nicht hektisch so das man jederzeit sich wehren und zuschlagen kann.
Keine Motionsickness
Keine Bugs bzw keine gefunden

Negativ:

Hitbox beim Bogenschießen  ist etwas komisch da manche Pfeile einfach durchgehen und Streifschüsse zählen leider auch nicht.
Die Sicht vom Inventar verstellt sich meisten wenn man was ablegen oder nehmen möchte.
Trotz starker Grafikkarte (1080 Ti) hatte ich mal heftige Frames einbrüche gehabt weil ein paar Gegner zuschlagen wollten, war nicht störend aber der Moment war krass.

DLC:

Gut gelungen für ein paar Spiel stunden.
Inventar wurde verbessert (ich denke da kam davor ein Update).
Neue Waffen und Bogen.
Story mäßig abwechslungsreich.

It's unfortunate because this game had great potential, but developer apparently decided to take the money and run, like so many do on steam.

51017348,"[h1]Vanishing Realms™[/h1] - Отличная, почти идеальная РПГ игра для VR.

Лично для меня, баталии на мечах, остаются самым весёлым занятием в VR. И в данной игре это не исключение.
Первое и главное - оружие. Как и в любой РПГ, собирая золото вы покупаете всё больше оружия и припасов.
Его тут не так много, но оно есть: 3 разных одноручных меча, 1 молот, 1 двуручный топор, 2 разных лука, 1 щит, 1 посох. Эти оружия можно по-разному компоновать и это немного разнообразит Вашу игру. 

[b]Из плюсов:[/b] Не идеальная (лично для меня) но приличная графика - на любителя. Звук простой, эффекты оружия и НПС красивые, но музыкального сопровождения нет. Интерфейс привычный для подобных РПГ-VR.

50508069,"One of the original VR greats. If you're a big fan of fantasy adventure games: You will want this game if you have a VR headset, I guarantee."
50148925,"Игра неожиданно оставила приятное впечатление. Графика мультяшная конечно, но игру это не портит. Ощущение чего-то магического, приключенческого, авантюрного. Даже не знаю как описать. Сходу просидел в игре больше часа, что для VR в общем-то показатель."
50029406,"Developer no longer supports game and still in early access (has been for about 3 years).

I'm posting this now because I noticed it's still fairly high up in the top sellers list, presumably because of its 2200 reviews with very positive. But if you look closely, you'll realise they're all 2-3 year old reviews for the most part."
49889641,"Looks like this one is stuck in eternal early access hell, but still worth it."

49351319,Very enjoyable
49343945,"This game is short, like a lot of VR experiences. Three hours are a little short to call it an RPG. No character development only different weapons to buy. Swords and hammer feel good, doublehanded axe is terrible and the bows don't feel good at all. Gfx are cartoonish and textures simple, mostly flat. After the finished the arena like challenge I felt like it all just got started but it was the end already. All in all it was not so bad but the price should be much lower as it seems there won't be any additional content anymore. For 20€ I would not buy it again nowadays."
49167725,"A great adventure.  It was more than an evening’s entertainment- it took me several successive nights to make it through the content.  Essentially a demo of what is possible, there are some flaws in the AI that are exploitable but the combat is spot on and not at all unpredictable or clumsy.  Probably the best VR adventure game up to 2018.  Updates are slow - barely annual - but what do you want for $20?  That’s barely a movie seat and popcorn anymore.  This is about two movies worth of entertainment, I think.

Honestly, this is the only VR combat game I didn’t crash out in frustration at some broken, floating combat thing."
49108922,"Excellent dungeon crawl!  It really makes you move around, squat, and try to hide behind obstacles.  One of the most immersive games I own.  I keep coming back to it."
49079169,"Now Karnage Chronicles and other games are out there, this one seems quite outdated. I seriously recommend KC if you can buy only one game of this kind.

BUT the game is still neat to play. Graphics are simple, but very elegant, easy to read, and well designed. Music lacks, but the global atmosphere is there. The fights are very good, even though I prefer those of KC. The interface is simple and excellent.

Overall, the game is still on the top of most VR productions nowadays. It belongs to the titles that were carefully crafted for VR in mind. RPG / slashers are my favourite kind of games in VR and that's why I appreciate this piece of game.

NB: I got it for 11 euros, which helps me feel better about my deal. 
NB: it seems the game is no longer under development: too bad, but it's still fun to play so far."
49061065,"Genial, super divertido e inmersión a tope, los indies salvan la VR!"
49032032,"Не стоит своих денег. Рисовка плохая, музыка почти однообразная. Деревянная боёвка. Нету сопровождающего голоса(он был здесь уместен). Она ничем тебя не затягивает. Нету головоломок. Есть пасхалка, но я решил на неё не тратить время.
Вообщем я бы поставил оценку этой игре 2.8 из 10. Спасибо за внимание."

48963058,This game is awesome.
48961562,"Игра довольно интересная! Много скрытых секретов, но не таких уж и замороченных, можно легко понять какие тайники будут в дальнейшем, по ходу игры. Приятная графика в виде мульта, не напрягает глаза. Удобный интерфейс, вместительные сумки, можно свободно таскать с собой и факел и кирку, даже если они периодически появляются. Много оружия и удобная смена. Игра проходиться на одном дыхании, весело, походу сражаясь со всякими чудными монстрами."

Il y a 2-3 heures de jeu pour le chapitre 1, mais il n'y en a pas d'autre. A fuir ! Quand je pense que j'ai claqué 25€ pour cette merde.

Mise à jour de l'avis : Un autre chapitre est finalement sorti, sauf qu'il faut payer pour l'avoir !
Quand on achète un jeu en acces anticipé, on s'attend à avoir le jeu complet plus tard et non pas à payer d'avantage pour avoir la suite plusieurs années apres."
48600941,"This was a great demo that never became a great game. More chapters were supposed to come out, and it has been a long time since the last update. It's been in early access for over 2 years. Melee combat in VR has evolved considerably since this game came out, and anything that does not use physics for its weapons feels terrible by comparison."

48434938,This game has been abandoned which is unfortunate. Had promise but the updates are so infrequent. In it's current state it's about a 2 dollar game. This is essentially 20 bucks to buy a demo. Get VR dungeon knight instead. It has the same kind of feel but far more frequent updates.

48336597,"[h1]So muss Action-VR sein[/h1]

Als ich mir die Oculus Rift gekauft hab, hatte ich genau solche Spiele im Sinn. 
Vanishing Realms ist ein Action-Adventure mit Ähnlichkeiten zu Skyrim. Im Fokus steht Schwertkampf, Bogenschießen und das Erkunden der linearen Welt.

[b]Kommentar zu VR[/b]
Ich muss endlich mal weiter spielen.. Vanishing Realms war eins der ersten Spiele, dass ich in VR ausprobiert hab und durch das ich auch begeistert wurde. Es gibt noch sehr viel Amateurhaftes da draußen, natürlich der technologischen Komplexität geschuldet. Ein halbwegs gehyptes Spiel wie Arizona Sunshine fand ich zum Beispiel gar nicht so gut, wie es gemacht wurde, es war eher der gute erste Eindruck und meißt ist das in VR schon alles, was zählt, viel mehr Inhalt gibt es manchmal nicht wirklich. Ist zu verschmerzen und mein Kopf dankt es mir, die virtuelle Realität ist nach wie vor anstrengend...

[b]Zwischen Anstrengung und Euphorie[/b]
Eins der Spiele, die plus Qualität auch noch Quantität mitbringt ist Vanishing Realms, man kann so ziemlich alles tun, was VR ausmacht. Gucken, Rumhampeln, kurz die Brille abnehmen, weil man sich vor Anstrengung setzen muss, und andere mehr oder weniger alltägliche Nebenwirkungen. 

Die Grafik gefällt mir echt gut, es ist schlicht gehalten; auf die gute Art. Eine detailverliebte Umwelt wie in Skyrim VR ist es mit Sicherheit nicht, aber es sieht dennoch ansehnlich aus. Klein und kompakt hab ich in VR auch ehrlichgesagt lieber, der Kopf wird schon genug überfordert.

Die Kämpfe gegen die Gegner machen unheimlich viel Spaß und ist mit das Beste, was es aktuell in dem Segment gibt. Es ist einfach gehalten mit Blocken, Schlagen und Bogenschießen und erfordert doch eine gewisse Körperliche Anstrengung. Die Bewegungsabläufe sind flüssig und die Hits bzw. Misses sind nachvollziehbar, man muss halbwegs genau zielen. 

Fortbewegung läuft durch Teleportation. Ich hab die Erfahrung gemacht, dass das für den Körper einfacher zu akzeptieren ist, in Minecraft wird mir persönlich leicht schwindelig. Ist sicher Typsache, aber das ist VR sowieso immer.

[b]Die Mühe wert[/b]
Jetzt weiß ich, wie sich die Kritiker am Anfanger des Gaming gefühlt haben, man muss Sachen bewerten, die mittlerweile in nicht-VR-Spielen selbstverständlich sind. VR ist ganz am Anfang und Vanishing Realms ist ein guter Start!"
48214633,"Classic early VR game, it was fun"
48212383," With all the new VR dungeon games out now, I was worried that I might have waited too long to play this one. I thought it might have simply been eclipsed by newer games with better graphics, etc.

I was wrong. This still seems like the best VR dungeon game out there. Yes, the graphics are somewhat simple, but they are also highly polished, and more importantly, all the graphical elements mesh together to create a seamless, believable VR world. There is a consistency to the presentation here that goes a long way to creating that all important sense of immersion. The sound design is also top notch.

And then you have the melee-style combat which, to my mind, still has not been superseeded elsewhere. It's both fun and somewhat challenging in that you can't just flail away and hope to prevail.

So a great visual and sonic presentation along with a good combat system equals great gameplay IMO. Vanishing Realms remains one of the best if not the best VR games of its type and I highly recommend it.

"
48191536,"Original: The first chapter is great, very enjoyable and a world you can get lost in. The second chapter, while fun, wasn't quite up to the standard of the first, the first was a journey while the second was more of a combat arena. I still very much recommend this game and look forward to future additions!

Update: After several years in EA with no meaningful updates the game came out of EA with no updates and a paid DLC with all the additional content, the base price isn't really worth it and the DLC sounds like it contains most of the game, really disappointing after such a promising start but I guess this is one of those possible outcomes when you support a developer in the early stages of a game.

Worth it on a discount but the base game is a demo, the DLC is the game, so bear in mind you will need both to get the actual game."
48156047,"Likes: The inventory management system was the best I’ve seen. I enjoyed the point and click movement controls. The sword, shield and arrow play were impressive and very responsive. The little side discoveries are a big plus, in my opinion. 

Dislikes: Did not live up to the art work on the cover. I cartoon look was a surprise but felt natural after a very short time. 

Overall: I really enjoyed this. I came across things at times where I said it would be great if they included this, only to turn the corn and have my wishes fulfilled. I would be through the game again. Well worth the $20 admission fee.

47977262,"Glad i played this as a first VR game, if you are looking into this and karnage chronicles, play this first."
47950978,Gefällt mir sehr gut
47699355,"Had this game since 2016 and still love playing through it. Nicely thought out and always being improved, this is still mt favourite VR game.
Playing with the wireless setup on Vive really brings out the design of the game, since the only real drawback, as with any open world game in VR, is the constant cable agravation (not the game's fault, obviously). 
While the game, like most VR titles, is fairly short, bear in mind that VR is complicated (I develop non-game VR) and this is a really impressive game, particularly for a one man studio. Honestly I'd feel bad *not* paying for any further DLC, so bring them on dev!"

47618469,"If a vr old school rpg is what you are looking for then look no further, this is it. A favorite of mine with a nice bit of content for a vr game and plenty of stuff to do."
47395589,"WOW! To think this is the genius of a single individual is mind-blowing! I have just started playing with VR and I cannot believe the immersion. This game is so far incredible. I don't want it to end. Definate replayability. Please keep up the content for this game. One of my favorite games so far. For us RPG fans, this is the ultimate experience."
47375342,"Vanishing Realms shows us the first steps what a VR Games RPG can be in the near future. It's a great experience fight against the skull fighters for the first time. It's guaranteed fun for sure! 
"
47106013,"Game is showing its age in a lot of areas, Index controller implementation is not ideal, but it's still a beautiful game (art assets and music score) and very unique to any other VR dungeon crawler with a very Zelda-like feel. Vanishing Realms is one of a kind and may remain that way for some time to come."
47084418,"Ton of Fun, very immersive."
46944956,Super jeu avec du bon contenu
46873029,Pretty good. But needs some changes to certain things. Alot of the enemies can be easily defeated by waving your sword around like a crazy person and they don't move very much. I think the game would be a bit better if everything moved at 1.5 times the speed and the enemies tried to get around your shield rather than just standing in front of you. It's like a 3/5 experience but sadly it's the best vr game I've played so far other than tabletop sim. Better than Skyrim VR/10.
46674503,"I've played quite many VR games by now but Vanishing Realms might be the best vr adventure game out there. Resources are quite scarce so you will find it meaningful to scavenge the environment for treasures and supplies. It also has the best melee combat whether it be dual wield, sword and board or two handed.

As for negatives, the game is quite linear, short and visually plain. Still this is one of the games I showcase to friends and family when introducing wonders of VR."
46322263,"This game has the best combat system of any game I've played on the Vive so far. Parrying an attack and then following up with a counter in this game is one of the most satisfying things I've experienced in VR. It's fun having to vary your tactics for different enemies, too, and the best part to me is that you can't just wiggle your sword around and expect to win every battle, as is (sadly) the case with most games of this type. Just make sure you have a large enough play area, because the battles get intense and I sometimes forgot I was also inside a real world environment (which I count as a good thing). My only concern with it is the developer, who has been largely absent for some time now. I wish he would at least post verbal updates, if not actual updates/new chapters."
46199757,I really wanted to like this game but the controls in game are extremely bad. Far to often the menu pops up in the middle of combat. This was designed for the VIve and ported to the Rift. Sadly they didn't tweak the controls for the rift or at least provide the ability to bind the controls differently which makes the game more of a pain than anything. I really like the story and the visuals and other elements but combat just sucks. Maybe they'll release the next chapter with updates to that controls to make it better.  The ending really needs work. SAVE ALL OF YOUR MANA UNTIL THE END BOSS OR ELSE
45890257,"My favorite game on VR,  you know your in a great VR experience when you feel a little twinge of fear about going around that next corner."

45772943,Loved this game.
45763694,"I have 50+ VR games in my library now. Vanishing realms is one of two that have gripped me. Everything is so intuitive, lighting candles, setting fires, firing arrows, avoiding arrows, climbing ropes and chains. You simply try what you would do in real life and it works. Moving about the landscape doesn't cause motion sickness. Getting killed doesn't set you back too far. its brilliant, very addictive. The only other game that held my attention through to completing it was Arizona Sunshine."
45755809,"Love it. This game is exactly how I wanted my VR experience to be.  
My favorite experiences in this game: 
   * Feeling like a ranger hiding behind trees sniping enemies with a bow.
   * Taking on two skeletons at once dual weilding swords.
   * Minecraft mining.
   * Feeling like a total badass at the end.

My only complaints are that the backtracking can be annoying, and that there's not more!
10/10

If you want a fantasy RPG in VR, this is the one."
45750138,"I normally do not review games so this is just my 2 cents.  I love a lot of different types of games from Call of Duty to to old school EveryQuest.  I been getting a lot of games for VR and many I find are just OK and some I find out was not worth the sale price I paid.  This game I really like!  The Graphics are good, even know it is cartoonish. The gameplay is smooth and easy paced and I find very entertaining.  The VR Experience works well and the only issue I have is dropping things LOL  Well worth the price!"
45735875,"First proper single player experience in VR for me. How to say that... I asked my girlfriend if she wants to try it... she wanted... she told me she is thirsty... I told her that´s because she is playing 4 hours in a row... she told me to get her a drink... a told her to get off her headset in order to drink from the glass... she said no, give me my drink by using a straw, I don´t want to put down the head set.

I hope this summarizes it."

45318307,"A decent romp that scratches the RPG itch in VR. However, everything you interact with is below your waist, so you're spending 70% of your time physically looking down.

Regrettably, there haven't been any meaningful updates for quite some time.  It has been in Early Access for about 2.5 years.  This now appears to be abandonware.

There are similiar, better games out there now.  Put your support into them."

44632143,"There's a lot of other similar games out there now that are much better. The cost to gameplay time ratio is off.  I show that many hours from showing it to all my friends when I got my new Vive.  Way back then, at the launch of the Vive, this game was great, short, but great.  2 years later it has hardly been updated.  It's obvious the developer has another job and got stuck or bored with working on this, but has decided to continue asking $20 for it and bait people along in the forums so they keep waiting. Lower the price, man.  Call it a day.  This now looks like a shameless money grab that doesn't deserve the reviews it's sporting."
44540245,"I enjoyed this game. It's certainly one of the better VR experiences out there. 

My only complaint is the menu design. It's unclear how to start in hard mode without starting a new game entirely. Maybe that is the point? Also, it looks like you can click on checkpoints and such, but my room scale space does not extend that far. All in all, it is very confusing and could use some polishing."
44488745,"Please expand this amazing and viseral game experience! This was my first and favorite vrrpg and I am longing for more! 
"
44356948,"Vanishing Realms has been my favorite RPG in VR since its release in 2016.

The RPG tropes such as finding loot, fighting skeletons, solving puzzles to open doors have gotten a cutesy ""VR treatment"" here, which is a pleasure to play. The pretty cartoony graphics remind of a game like Zelda,  and similarly you pick up new abilities, solve puzzles, and fight cutesy enemies with unique styles to defeat along the way. 

It's a bit of a broken record here, but I really wish the developer made more content. The last chapter 2 came out in September 2016(!), it's been just technical updates and arena mode since. Given the quality of the game, it should be possible to hire someone to make a couple extra chapters? I think many players would prefer a little more repetitive mechanics and a new chapter every 6 months for $10, rather than lots of unique elements but having to wait over a year for a bigger more expensive update."
44101654,"I peeked around a corner in a dark corridor. I knew what was going to happen next, I felt it in my [i]bones[/i]. Suddenly, a spooky [i]skeleton[/i] emerged. I tried to poke it with my sword, but that didn't get [i]under it's skin[/i]. The skeleton swung its sword, and just like that, I ran out of health. I guess you could say I got [i]boned[/i]."
44018519,"I was surprised at how entertaining this game is. It was a gift, I never would have Purchased it myself.
I extremely glad it was gifted to me otherwise I would have missed out.

43940189,"I don't understand why people are calling this game short. Its 5+ (I havent even finnished the game yet so i don't know how much longer the game is) hours of good fun. 

-I would say its a must buy if you like sword, bow and arrow combat. 
-I don't need to say anything anymore because all the comments are on par with the game. 
Really hope this game gets worked on more!"
43910874,"Another awesome experience in VR!  The graphics are good,  the UI works well, but what really shines here is the combat.  I really like how you have to swing your sword quickly when there are openings after an enemy attack, and parrying and blocking works very well.  Plus, you'll never forget battling the GIANT skeleton as he swings his humongous mace at your face! And for an early access game there is quite a bit o' content here."

43381700,Best VR game I've played yet.
43380481,"I enjoyed this game immensely; bought it on sale, but I'd say it's worth full price.  Game mechanics are excellent and progress nicely as the difficulty ramps up.  Enemy defensive strategies were satisfying to overcome.

I do hope the development eventually resumes and provides more chapters."
43374774,"Overall it is a great experience, full of fun combat, fantasy settings and thoughtful exploration. It gives a feeling for what could really be the potential of an open-world VR experience.

However, this is still to be considered an experiment/demo. The game is rather short (2-3h if you like taking your time), has many mechanics that still need polishing and depth. It doesn't help that communication from the dev. team is rather scant and there hasn't been an update in 6 months...

As it is, I'm giving it a 7/10. There's great promise, but there's more/lots of work to be done!"
43362747,"Отличная RPG со всеми составляющими.  
Захватывает сразу и до конца. И ничего удивительного тут нет, т.к. проходится часа за 3, очень мало такой игры, к сожалению..
По сути, только вошел во вкус,  тут-то и концовочка подкралась незаметно.. 
Определенно стоит взять эту игру и получить 3-4 часа сплошного удовольствия..
Именно такой RPG и должна быть в VR, только длиннее бы раз в 10, было бы в самый раз."
43278506,"This is the best VR game I've played, and I've played a lot. In fairness, this is also probably my favorite genre.

The gameplay is excellent. The interactions with the world provide the exact amount of freedom and realism to keep the game moving but not make you feel limited. Everything is smooth. Graphics are fantastic. Story line and varying encounters are wonderful. There's new stuff around every corner, and you get to explore the corners of many different worlds.

Killer Game. 10/10 at full price or more."
43079287,"A really good, but short game. I think a lot of the hype and high reviews for this reflect the early lack of VR content. It's still a great game and I'll give it a 3.5/5. I'd rather pay for this 2-3 hour engaging experience than going out to a movie theater once.

Areas for improvement:
1. Too short - definitely need to do more with this since it was very fun

Positives:
1. You'll enjoy playing this. Collecting treasure. Using the bow, swords, shields, magic wands. 
2. Graphics are decent for an early VR game

Bottom line: At the right price, it's something you want to experience. It's 2-3 hours to beat the game, so think of the value compared to going out and watching a movie. This is way more entertaining and engaging than a movie."
43072231,"Game is okay, but very short and combat is clunky. Good for a first VR experience, not much more."
43009608,I love this game!
42820136,"J'ai l'impression d'avoir longtemps rêvé d'une expérience de ce type.
On s'incarne dans un guerrier dans un donjon bien sombre.
On trouve au fur et a mesure de l'aventure tous les types d'armes classique du heroic fantaisy, super feeling autant pour l'arc que pour les épées, spéciale dédicace de gros plaisir pour le rendu de la hache a 2 main !!!
Grosse note de plaisir lorsqu'on se retrouve a grimper a la corde ou se bruler des toiles d'araignée ou rideaux a la torche.

Le jeu est court, 2H , la difficulté pas vraiment présente, mais l'immersion est complête.
Un grand moment"
42796987,"Игра была пройдена примерно за 5 часов неторопливого прохождения. Здесь хватает и боев с монстрами, и всяческих тайничков, и несложных загадок. Причем, исследование подземелья и бои хорошо между собой чередуются, поэтому не устаешь ни от того, ни от другого. В конце же вас ждет настоящее испытание ваших боевых способностей - главное, чтоб джойстики остались целыми, когда в запале будете крушить стены и предметы в своей комнате))

Очень рекомендую в начале игры сразу поставить галочку напротив сложности «Hard», т.к. первый раз зайдя в игру и не заметив этой опции, я начала скучать уже после нескольких стычек с монстрами, т.к. они не представляли никакой угрозы в бою. А вот с повышенной сложностью стало намного интересней – тут для лечения уже и еда понадобилась, которая до этого казалась ненужной, и даже несколько раз пришлось умереть.

К слову, смерть в игре очень разочаровала тем, что она не накладывает никаких штрафов на игрока – ты просто воскресаешь неподалеку с полным здоровьем, а все монстры, которых ты убил, так и остаются убитыми. Таким образом можно хоть об каждого второго монстра убиваться – все равно ничего не потеряешь, зато получишь бесплатное лечение, и это даже может послужить стимулом лишний раз умереть, что я считаю неправильно. В общем, если не использовать эту недоработку игры намеренно, а пытаться по-честному всеми силами выжить, то играть будет гораздо интересней.

For Developers of Vanishing Realms:
I really like this game. The ""Hard"" difficulty was very interesting - glad that game has this option. However, the player’s death should not be so free! After death, the player resurrects with a full health, and the monsters remain killed - this greatly simplifies the game, reducing interest. Would like that after death the player return to the state that was before the battle, and the pack of monsters that killed the player would respawned again (as a normal auto-save/load). It would be honest and interesting.
PS: I think that the magic wand needs to increase damage, because it requires a lot of mana but it’s not such a formidable weapon as expected, so after several attempts I did not even use it."

42479504,"The core mechanics of this game are sword slashing/stabbing, shield blocking, and ranged weapons. It is point and click movement, but you want room-scale to dodge or pursue enemies. There are some very basic puzzles.

The scope of this game is not far-reaching, but what it does have is very well executed.

The one issue I have is that it's very balanced towards looting everything you can find. I fixed this problem by giving myself unlimited gold in Cheat Engine, but the developers should make a menu option adjustment for prices."
42418578,Just completed for the first time in ~2 hours and even for a game 2 years old it is great for VR! Very good level design and controls. The two handed axe is really fun and immersive. Great RPG elements like rhymes that give you hints about what to do but you can also ignore them to suffer the fate of a trap or something. Just enough really good elements combined to make this a fantastic playthrough.
42337321,leave early access with DLC. This say everything.
42146098,"So i'm halfway through the game, and i'm reluctantly going to say it's worth it.
This is a game made by a single man, and it has swords, axes, hammers, ect in it, boss battles, mini bosses, fully realized combat physics, and hand crafted enviroments. This is a pretty game, with good controls (with the exception of how the two handed axe handles, although this is probably more a vr controller problem)

This is pretty well a take it how it is situation, the developer does not update this game very often at all. He's got better things to do apparently. So, i'm going to say, to me, it was worth it."
41912284,"Maybe the most polished RPG in VR right now, besides Skyrim VR. I would highly recommend picking this game up when its on sale!"
41902051,"Probably best skilled sword play I've encountered in VR. Remniscient of really early video games in terms of depth. Good mechanics, not sure if there's a story. I had fun, but I don't think I would buy this again. 4.57/10"
41877017,"Bought in early release to help support. Seemed promising.  Enjoyed it too. BUT Now you make the people who supported you and those that get the game have to pay for some DLC just to be able to finish the game that it should have been a part of to begin with?! Congrats, you're well on your way to being the next EA games. FFS, this is a dirty business practice and needs to be adressed."
41854187,c'esr graphiquement dégueulasse d'un ennui total et toujours en early acces
41850536,"I guess I got my money's worth, but I can't help but feel ripped off. Development seems to have ceased, and the dev gives you about 3 hours of gameplay before it ends (only 2 chapters!?), and now apparently any future chapters will be paid DLC. Can't recommend unless money is no object. I didn't really have that much fun. SkyrimVR, however... get that instead.

Edit: Also, I don't know why everyone thinks the combat is good. It's not. It's honestly quite bad."
41741756,Awesome vr game. Other. Vr rpgs should take note.
41712115,Very well made and worth the price.  I wish it was multiplayer
41675669,"Great game, just finished it up tonight. It took me about 3.5 hours to finish, and I was taking my time; looking at everything and trying to discover as many secrets as I could (and I still didn't find them all!) Has a very Zelda-esque feel, but in first person. Surprised it is still in Early Access, as it is very well polished and a great experience from start to finish.

The melee combat feels very good, unlike 99% of the VR games on the market currently. I have very few complaints, the largest being that I want more time in this world! I hope more chapters are still coming (would gladly pay for DLC to keep development going).

Looking forward to upcoming content, keep up the good work. Definitely a must have for any VR library. I can see this going down in history as a classic title in VR gaming."
41674941,Игра отличная. С нетерпением жду продолжения.
41639430,"Definitely check out this game, it's a lot of fun."
41636918,Fun dungeon run.  This is not a randomly generated dungeon so everything is placed with care.  This leads to secrets and achievements which feel more rewarding when found.  The dungeon running (the first part) is better than the gladiator arena (second part).  Dungeon running has some replayability since you have multiple types of weapons.  Interested to see more dungeons for the next part in the series but I haven't heard anything new in a long time.
41631723,"Es una maravilla, luchar como un poseso con dos espadas al estilo Drizzt Do'Urden pero en chabacano no tiene precio, si, merece la pena, coge dos espadas cuando puedas, sirven para parar estocadas, y puedes encadenar ataques que da gusto. El problema son las flechas, para eso está el escudo o esquivar.
El combate, el ambiente, la variedad de armas, la exploración... es una delicia, lástima que tiene solo dos capítulos y se nota que estaba preparado para más, cortito, en 5 horas te lo acabas y yo soy de explorar rincones y tomarme mi tiempo...
Ojalá siga algún día la aventura!"
41597686,"One of the best RPGs for VR, it has its limitations and only the first part would I recommend as a RPG. The second part is an arena battle which I found far less satisfying than exploring. The first part was great, this is one of my first purchases, and I haven't found a game that really surpasses the first part.  The closest is probably Karnage Chronicles (which is still being expanded, and with a few combat improvements could surpass this)."
41586289,"Not a game for me. It runs through the parts of an RPG that I find tedious. Climb up a ladder, get a key from that chest there, go back down and unlock that door, hit the switch which opens these 3 doors, go in them and get the... on and on. A bit of combat, but rather simple and not too engaging for me: usually only a few enemies at a time. 

Overall, a more puzzle based RPG that takes its time; and I was looking for something faster and more engaging. Ended up refunding after 30min."
41577953,"Chapter one of the game was amazing. I felt enchanted from the moment I began. I felt compelled to explore every nook and cranny, to overturn every rock and peak behind every tree, and I felt rewarded for it, and rewarded again for thinking creativly.

Combat felt slow and thought out - do I block or do I try to sneak in an attack? Do I use this weapon or that.

With that being said, chapter two was a major disapointment. It felt like like a playground to throw around all the toys I got through chapter one. Toys that were very very overpowered. Things weren't scaled at all in chapter two and it felt like just a hack and slash. No thought needed.

Still, I recomend it for chapter one alone."
41576449,"Super great experience. Nice UI. But not fit with my MR UI. 
I can suggest this game to anyone."
41510479,Just not enough going on to validate $20
41410024,Love this game
41392258,"Don't look for updates. Looks like it will stay early acess and never get finished, but still the best fanticy RGP type game I've played. 

I got it on sale, as $20 feel a little steap for such a short game."
41207093,"If you an RPG fan and you have a VR system, get it.  This game is why we like RPG's and why we like VR.

It's not gimicky but it does take advantage of it being VR.  In a word, it's fun."
41142999,"The game is great.  Childhood fantasy brought to life, like zelda in VR.  Just wish there was more of it.  There is one full chapter which is pitch perfect.  The second chapter is more of a battle arena.  Game is definitely unfinished.  What is there is good, but I am not sure it will ever make it out of early access. :("
41091865,"Such a great game, just too short!!"
40985192,"Vanishing Realms plays very well in VR.  There is a variety of weapons to chose from and some unique behaviour that I haven't come across other games of this caliber.  Malee fighting and using the bow are both fun an natural feeling.  I love how the enemies dodge your arrows after taking a few hits but it would have added to the game if there was more variablity to this behaviour.  Verticality is well utilized in the level design.  Even though the game is linear in the way it plays out there are some interesting mechanics to be explored, like climbing up ropes, buring leaves and debris that covers treasure and access to areas, etc.  My only real complaint after playing for 5 hours is, that like in many VR games, walking is just floating around... there's are no footstep sounds or head-bob to give you the illusion of walking.  Perhaps this would make some people naseous, but I hope developers explore on how to improve this mechanic in VR and make it more realistic.  Thumbs up to this game and I hope the developers take lessons learned from this title and apply them to a a more story-driven sequel in the future."
40818635,"Wow. I was really blown away by this, particularly the first hour where you're finding your way out of the initial castle/dungeon. The atmosphere and immersion is just incredible. This is the sort of game you could have only dreamed of playing when you were a kid. It really feels like you are there, fighting/finding your way through and I loved every minute. Trials of Steel is a bit of a simple boss rush add-on but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I think that speaks to the fantastic melee fighting system where you actually have to raise your arm to defend with a shield and swing with your other arm to attack with a sword while dodgin around with your actual body. All with one to one movement. I think it's easy to forget what a phenomenal achievement that is and how amazingly it adds to the classic adventure/RPG game. I loved the archery and mining mechanics too. The visuals are lovely and the whole thing runs beautifully. 

More please!!"
40782717,"可以说是我目前玩过的操作体验最好的冒险解谜战斗类游戏了，并且很良心的有完整的简体中文支持。游戏中，你将做为一个冒险者去探索一个多年前就从历史上消失的国度，在其中寻宝、解谜、穿越陷阱，并且与突然出现的骷髅战斗。随着游戏的进程，你可以发现并购买越来越多的武器，包括剑、盾、弓、双手斧等。双持武器这种操作也是可以的。

此外，游戏中的任何可燃物都能够点燃，大部分罐子箱子等东西都可以被破坏。甚至在黑暗处，你需要自己拿起火把照明。此外，整个游戏的气氛虽然是比较紧张的，但是不会格外恐怖，怪物的外形还是有几分可爱的。整个战斗过程还是非常激动人心的，唯一的缺点就是游戏有自动暂停机制。在身体过于接近游玩区边缘的时候游戏会暂停（游玩区比较小的话可能遇到一开打就暂停的尴尬情况），其他的方面还是非常不错的。虽然目前游戏只有两章（第三章仍在开发），大概两三个小时就能通关，但是可玩性已经非常不错了，强烈推荐各位有兴趣的去体验一番。"
40776943,So far its the only Vr game I have finished so its pretty good in my opinion. I am looking forward to the next one?
40762450,"I would consider this the best VR game available at the moment.  As an old-skool gamer who has read various fiction to do with the future of VR (The Web 2027/2028, Ready Player One etc.), before getting a VR rig I was always most excited about the idea of VR high fantasy, and this hits the spot.

The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is fun and overall it's an absolute blast.  For the sake of completeness i will suggest two areas in which it could do better:
1) The fighting - in melee there are few openings by traditional means - most higher level enemies have shields and you can't hit them with normal stabbing, slashing or overhead shots.  You have to come over the top with your sword (/mace/hammer etc.) only.  This leads to quite repetitive fights and the enemies don't really change their tactics so you just keep doing the same move.
2) The writing.  It feels like this game was made by non-English speakers.  That's fine, but if you're going to release it in English, get a creative English writer to help with your content.  The riddles commonly don't rhyme or scan, and seem to be like a bad translation from another language.  In a few hours a good writer could have improved these and made a big input into immersion.

All in all though, an excellent game and one any VR gamer who likes a fantasy dungeon crawl should get."
40737816,rather meh personally
40725488,"I'm completely gonna skip the part where I bitch about how 'short' the game is. VR-gaming is still in it's infancy, almost all VR games are short. So yes, it's kinda short, but on the upside, hey, it is fucking VR!!!

Even though I havent played that many yet, so far Vanishing Realms gave me the greatest feeling of experiencing a complete adventure. By far. You collect stuff, that later on you find you actually need, you solve little puzzles, fight different foes and the ending is, for what it is, pretty satisfying.

CONS: I'ld say none really. Buy this game, stop complaining about the length, and just have a bloody BLAST like I had!

Am I gonna play this one again someday. You bet your *** I will!"
40696339,"I've had a few ""best VR game I've played yet"" moments throughout my time with VR so far, and will no doubt have many more to come. Vanishing Realms is definitely one of these games, and I'm not sure it'll be topped particularly soon.

Whilst quite short, it's made up for by the well implemented mechanics and engaging RPG atmosphere. This is the only RPG I've played to completion in VR yet, and haven't had enough! I sincerely hope this is continued.

The plot is not hugely complex, but is interesting and engaging nonetheless. The game does a good job of explaining the background with good use of environmental props to support it. From quite early on in the game you feel like you know your place and how to proceed. I would love to see the lore expanded on in future, as in it's current form there is not overly much explained about *why* things are the way they are.

Both teleportation and ""walking"" are available as movement options, both feeling very intuitive making the world easy to navigate around without much thought.
Interacting with the environment is quite satisfying, and interactable props respond well to the player.

Combat is incredibly easy once you get used to it, but considering the limitations posed by VR this is very understandable. With mouse and keyboard it's very easy to turn and dodge very fast, but not so much in VR. The headset cable, real world objects, walls etc generally make rapid combat tricky for the player, especially for people in a small space like me. Despite the ease with which enemies can be dispatched, I have no complaints about the combat.

I definitely consider this a ""must play"" VR game as it gets so many aspects of VR gaming so very right. At the current price (£15 UK) it's a little expensive; 3 hours playtime to complete is £5 an hour, so maybe consider picking up on sale if you're unsure. 
However looking back, I would happily pay £15 for this! Perhaps when VR becomes more ubiquitous that will change, but currently VR is an expensive hobby whichever way round you look at it, so I would still recommend even at this price :)"
40574396,"Für mich ein fantastisches Abenteuer! Genau so habe ich mir VR vorgestellt. Ich will nichts vom Gameplay verraten, aber es ist sehr motivierend. Ich habe jetzt fast 5 Stunden gespielt und bin noch nicht am Ende, denke ich. Die Grafik ist schön. Die Modelle sind einfach, aber stilvoll umgesetzt. Es ist nicht zu gruselig, aber sehr stimmungsvoll. Eine klare Kaufempfehlung!"
40546816,"This game was good when I first bought it, even though Rift wasn't officially supported.  Decided to revisit it today and play from scratch, it's fantastic now with enough movement/comfort options regardless of your VR platform to play it how you want to. 

A thoroughly enjoyable VR adventure in the vein of, dare I say, Zelda.  Well worth the asking price, heck it was worth the asking price back during christmas 2016!

Possibly my favourite VR experience across Steam, Oculus and PSVR."
40540046,"I would like to recommend this game, having seen many videos of people playing it, but as of right now, it does not work for me, and others, where the game opens to a frozen screen. Support is non-existant, so there is no timeline for when if ever this problem will be addressed."
40507784,"An extremely short, slowwww-to-update, but very high-quality VR experience.

Chapter 2 came out in September of 2016, and there have only been technical updates since. There was also mention  that the third chapter is going to be DLC, so not only will you end up paying $20 for 2 hours of gameplay, but you will be required to spend more if you want the third chapter down the road.

Update: This review still stands! This game got zero content updates while in Early Access, and now has left EA. For the new content, you need to pay an additional $15 for the DLC. What was the point of Early Access? What is called an 'expansion' is actually just the finished game."
40497458,"Vanishing realms is the first VR game I've ever played all the way through.  I actually played through it twice.  The journey was very fun, and pretty well laid out.  It's easy to forget you are in a VR game.  There were a few moments when I actually screamed out loud because I got startled a few times by large movement I wasn't expecting.  Very fun.  Looking forward to the rest of the journey."
40423100,"It's a tad dated now. Things are still great, solid game, but old games like this should decrease the price to justify newer standards and expectations for the amount of content. Just a bit on the slightly pricey side rn

--------

A short, 3 hours of pure awesomeness. In exchange for the short play time, you got a very nicely crafted gameplay with clever map designs. Game looks deceivingly simple but is challenging.

What I like the most is the work put into the combat system. There is a 'cooldown', or a collision/speed detection system in place, so only 'valid' sword swings count. So unlike some other VR games, you actually need to use your controller like a sword instead of swing wigging spinning it. 

Short playtime might be a problem for some others, but in my case I think its well worth the tradeoff."
40261687," Like with most VR titles this is sooo short, it is a demo for $20. I personally think this is about $5-10 worth of game. Now that that's out of the way, it is good! If you like dungeon crawls just get it! Well when its on sale lol"
40133511,"Great game! It's fun, it is easy to get into, it looks nice, it never crashed on me."
40131276,Really good rpg for vive. I hope we will see more from these developers after they finished this game.
40114588,"Awesome start!   This game is built on a GREAT foundation but is way too short.  The fundementals are definitely there, the inventory system is killer, the concept is fantastic.  Someone said this will be like the Zork of VR and I think they are right.  This is the beginning of something incredible.  Hope to see much much more of this type of game.  
I recommend it highly.   Only issue I had was auto-pausing during some fights but it was nothing game breaking and possibly something I could have tweaked.  Other than that the short play through was a fantasy fulfilled.  For someone who grew up on Dungeons and Dragons wishing to be the adventurer... this was sweet."
40075666,"Realy fun, best Vr experience with Subnautica. Love the end and need more."
40033004,"TL; DR: Whether you are new to VR, or a jaded gogglevision pro who merely shrugged when Fallout 4 VR dropped, this game will enchant you and make you lose your bookmark on reality.

""So immersive I lost myself, and a skeleton came out of the floor, and IRL I fell over my coffee table getting away, and I got a bad bad bruise. That's when I knew the game was badass, though.""

I admit, I haven't had my VR rig for long (Dec 2017), but this is one of the first games I ever played.  I loved it then, and I love it now. 

I could do without the cartoony part of it, but really the game has a lot of polish, and YOU WILL lose yourself in the moment.

I have played all kinds of games, everything from Myst to Thief to Fallout 1/2 to Diablo to Legend Of Zelda and even old Doom. I have been waiting over 20 years for viable VR, and in December, when I went to choose games to buy, this game was one of the first 10 I bought. It was also the first VR RPG I played. I loved it so much that it became the rule for grading other games, lol. I play VR to be immersed, and to escape my life and my depression; I guess you could call it an emotional support tool, and I don't care if it seem antisocial, as it is keeping me alive. Anyway, I have played through both chapters of the game, and have even started a new game on hard settings. It is just a LOT of fun, and really no one can own a VR rig and NOT play this game, it should be a law, (unless you hate RPGs and fun, and if so why did you get a VR rig in the first place, wacko?)

PROS:
-Middle filler content is good, seamless
-Plenty to do and fight
-Some side stuff, like shooting apples for an achievement. Yum apples.
-Beautiful

Cons:
-The double ax sucks (or I suck using it or both)
-Not sure achievements are functional?
-The bow could maybe have a longer draw, or maybe my arms are too long? Also, it doesnt seem to track a fully-drawn notched arrow well if you hold a shot for a while. I have noticed this in other VR bow games to lesser or greater degrees, especially if I wear a hoody with the hood down. Hmmm?
-So immersive you could get hurt or break equipment. I have bruised a knee falling over a coffee table, and I broke my wand on the first day I got my VR rig, trying to cut open a skeleton guy when IRL I hit the wand on the wall. I had to take the wand apart and do the infamous thumbpad fix.

I think I bought the game for 25% off, which I think is fair for Chapter 1/2. More? IDK about that. Maybe."
40028356,"Очень понравилось взаимодействие с предметами, в игре присутствует всего понемногу.  В начальной версии , когда нельзя было ползать по цепям и веревкам, было веселей, приходилось швырять различные предметы чтобы скинуть кубок. С мобами можно устроить баталию. Возможно комуто не понравится графика, ну не у всех же мощьные видеокарты. . Очень жду продолжение, если оно будет. В игре чувствуется, что создатили действительно хотели ее довести до ума, и у них это получилось. Для начала индустрии VR одна из лучших. Для любителей RPG."
40022516,"Worth your time and money. 

So sad that alot of VR development have gone backwards since the launch of this game with many very poor titles out there, but this is worth it. 

Combat is good, story is good, locomotion can be set a way that you like (teleport or smooth, snapturning or smoothturning). Bow usage is great (alot of other games can learn from this one), parry and weapons works perfectly.

A must have VR classic."
40010154,"I have only just received an HTC Vive (Xmas 2017) so I am still a newbie.  That said, this is by far one of the best VR games I have played thus far.  Although the game is a bit linear, the ambiance is very good, the story line/progression is reasonable, and the combat both melee and ranged are very well done.

I am really looking forward to the addition of more content and highly recommend this game for those who like the medieval / LOTR / D&D style games.

Two BIG THUMBS UP for Vanishing Realms.

Deep Space Man"
39987745,"This feels like the VR game I've been waiting for. Real life dungeon crawling! It was really fun!

There is some room for improvement, and I’m sure dungeon crawlers will get more sophisticated as we get used to VR gaming. I do appreciate that this game was brought to market quickly—so I could play it! 

If I could offer recommendations to the devs, I could do without the cartoony enemies, as it made the game feel like a kid’s game. I wouldn’t have minded more variation in enemies, either. As far as combat goes, everything felt very natural. Enemies were tough before I figured out their weaknesses.  I really liked the bow! On the other hand, magic was super overpowered, and it seemed weird that enemies would just wait around for you to approach them, even if you were shooting them with arrows. 

All said, a great effort, and I’m picky with games. I will buy the next installment, for sure. 
"
39980601,I  really like this game. Sure it has low polys but the game play and the enviroment makes up for it. I'm a hack and slash gamer and this one fills the bill. Lots of fun!!
39976454,"Solid fun for looking like a scared 9 y/o designed the textures.  Some game breaking bugs later on unfortunately.  Also experienced repeated crashes from Steam, Steam VR, Oculus...couldn't even finish C2.  Seems like they are all fighting for pieces of control and like all greedy little fish, will only wonder where everyone went after they've torn each other to pieces.  God I hope someone sells tickets for that show..."
39954777,Terrible gameplay
39878671,"I loved this game. Yes, it is short, but it is extremely fun. I do think it has some replay value as well."
39740197,"Of all my VR games, this one is easily on par with the other best I've played.  It seems cartoonie, but it works so well.  I've never actually had to get my heart rate up before blocking and stabbing in a game before.  it was freaking cool.  Still playing it but still loving it.  This is a great example of how well a game can be done"
39734587,"Oh yes, what a beautiful game.  Brilliant lead in to the whole VR experience.  I even got some excercise battling the monsters.  Loved it, can't wait for more."
39707122,"I've only played briefly, but I've had a blast so far.  The low-poly environment still offers a great deal of immersion and atmosphere.  The inventory system is quick and easy to use, the weapons are fun and responsive.  When I was a kid, playing Legend of Zelda for the first time, I fantasized about being able to swing a sword at enemies, and this is that dream come true.

I'm one of the unlucky that gets motion sickness from ""walking"" in VR, but the navigation in Vanishing Realms is a great combination of trackpad walking and teleportation.  (Use the options to activate both.)  I move around by using teleportation and use the trackpad to adjust my position slightly while fighting or trying to pick up objects."
39694898,This game is amazing and a must have for rpg and vr fans. My only complaint is that the free locamosting is way too slow even when you turn it spring.
39672667,Very fun Zelda like game in VR.
39639746,"I really enjoyed this game. Its only about 3 hours of game play but the immersion experience is great! I love how when your fighting if you actually pay attention to where your sword is and where they are stricking you can actually fight incredibly effective. I enjoy how easy it is to run. I think the interface feels natural.  The only con is it is a bit lacking in content for a fantasy game at this poin, but I know its an early access."
39638016,"Well, I kind of liked the game but it deserves a thumbs down for several reasons:

- For only 3 hours of gameplay, it is overpriced just like most VR games, but this is a bit much.
- Yes, the dev promised there will be ""more"" for the same price, but nothing has been developed in more than a year. Dishonesty?
- The first half of the game was extremely frustrating with the game automatically pausing whenever you approached the limits of your playspace. You can disable that in options but it always gets re-enabled (after restart) and it was very unclear that this is what was causing it.
- Playing on the Oculus Rift, during fighting I somehow (have NO idea how) kept pressing the pause button in heat of combat (which takes me to the SteamVR page and sometimes to the pause screen???) That would be so frustrating I wanted to throw the game out the window. There is of course no way to remap controls for the Rift.

Positives:
- Climbing ropes
- Beating the ***t out of NPCs with accurate swings, interesting physics tho very easy to beat once figured out."
39567317,"I'm really digging this game, dunno why I wanted to long to play it.  It's become one of my favorite VR experiences so far on Rift, I'm enjoying it as much so far as I enjoyed Lone Echo.   Lots of exploration, plenty of combat, riddles to solve, money to collect.

I wish it were maybe a little more on the realistic looking scale than it is, but I do enjoy some of the fine details they have like skeletons eyes actually looking at and reacting to where my sword is.  If i hold it over my head pointed at them to try and go in for a side of the neck shot around their shield, their eyes look up and do the side in the direction of the tip of my sword.  It makes it feel more like combat would, and they properly react to your attacks and counter.  You can do stuff like block their incoming swing and reflect their arm away opening up a nice big gap to jab them.  Melee combat It's very satisfying.

Ranged combat, the bow and arrow stuff is pretty good.  I don't particularly like the magic staff combat though.  Right now i just have a fireball staff and it lobbs fireballs and there's no way to tell other than getting used to it how far the shots are going to go and at 100 mana cost per shot it depletes your mana quickly missing.

I hope Vanishing Realms is a good platform the devs can use to produce bigger, deeper RPG experiences from .  I'm really loving this game.  Almost 5 hours and I finished what I think is Chapter 1 .  Granted it could have been done faster but why rush when you're having fun."
39548723,"The best VR RPG I have played so far, and I have played maybe 10. The mechanics and controls are brilliant the best for any rpg I have played. Very immersive. I suppose the combat could be a bit more immersive, but that may just have been me. I had no sound, probably a bug on my end, but I actually forgot about that and had an enjoyable time for 40 mins, so far.

Edit 1: in one spot there were two of an item, when I went to pick up the second, the one in my backpack disappeared and the one i tried to pick up somehow dispeared from my hand. I do need that item, though. Not sure if this is a bug..."
39542183,"3 hours long game for that price. 
Okay, it's great, and I mean, it's GREAT. I had fun, but only for 3 hours. It's a good tech demo."
39519071,Wonderful game albeit being very short. Finished what's available right now in 3.2 hours - chapter one and two.
39515949,"MUST HAVE game in VR. The way to go for Dungeon games in VR, it allows you to move by either teletransporting or by natural movement, wich is very well done and easily to get used to."
39500732,"this is good game, i can tell , little bit of short but! there was no boring spot, everything was absolutely needed my concentration.

VR장르중에 가장 상호작용이 좋은 게임중 하나입니다

궁술,검술,막고 때리기등등, 잘 구현해 놨고

검술로 데미지를 입히려면, 무기를 일정거리를 속도를 내어 움직여야하는 조작이 특히 마음에 들었습니다 

제 점수는 8.7/10 입니다

짧은 플레이타임이지만 가격이 낮아서 이해는 갑니다

지속적인 업데이트도 하고 있으니 계속해서 기대해 볼만도 합니다

아직 얼리엑세스이니까요"
39497498,Very engaging game. Well worth the price. Probably the best VR game I have played so far.
39478929,"This game was a great experience! The world is detailed and will surprise you. The mechanics are polished and the gameplay is fantastic. The game is extremely easy in terms of winning all your battles, none of them gave me any trouble at all, including any boss/mini bosses, but it was incredible fun nonetheless. The game makes you feel like youre an adventurer, with swords, shields, bows and more! I loved this game and it was easily worth its price on sale. The game is terribly short though, with two chapters. Chapter 1 was an adequate length, and I am satisfied with it. It never hit me that chapter 2 wont be as long, in fact, i finished chapter 2 in 436 seconds. Yes seconds. So while the developer did a great job with the game, saying there are 2 chapters is very misleading. Chapter one was exceptional, chapter 2 seems more like bait to make you purchase chapter 3 when it is released. After playing chapter 1 though, I already decided im buying the next chapters as soon as they come out! 
Note to developer: You guys have done an amazing job, and I love this game so much. But the way you handled the second chapter (you know what im talking about, im avoiding spoilers) was a great surprise but then the chapter ends after a total of about 10 mins of play, was extremely dissappointing. If you put the whole game as part of just chapter 1, including everything of chapter 2, it would have been a better experience, far more thrilling and i would have felt no dissappointment! So the game is great, next time just put it all in one chapter I think. Just giving constructive feedback, great jobv <3"
39462917,It made me feel like I had stepped into a dungeon in Hyrule. I raised my shield when i got it! Just like Link! Would pay 20$ again to feel like Link!
39459349,"This game was fun but not complete, now that it's out of early access it is still not a complete game because literally the only thing that changed was some minor bug fixes and graphical improvements. I bought this game to support the developer, now I'm wishing it could refund it because of this shady day-1 DLC full-game-stuck-behind-another-paywall bullshit."
39451002,"Perfect game for average VR users. I recommend this game unless you expect something more action packed. No music, slow enemies, but perfect game for first timers. In short, this isn't a game for me, but I'm sure others will like it."
39450331,"Love this game!  Great price point (especially on sale).  I often get a bit dizzy from first person games but the teleport option works really well.  Game is very immersive.  Combat is fun but not too hard - at least at first.  I've probably bought 10 or so games since receiving my Samsung Odyssey this Christmas but this is by far, the best one yet.  Highly recommended!!!"
39448946,"Possibly the best Fantasy RPG currently available in VR.  It's definitely worth the money but if you can't make up your mind, wait for it to be out of early access and on sale.  You won't regret it."
39448467,游戏太赞了！而且现在支持中文了！是目前为止vr游戏的上乘之作，不信可以买来试玩一下，绝对让你不想退！！！
39448432,"Great game with one of the most imersive atmosphere that i had the pleasure to experiment in HTC VIVE, it definitely worth the buy, is relative medium size gameplay, hopefully the dev will add more content, but the mechanics and the ambient is incredible well developed.

It has sword and shield play, wand and magic, archery and target, almost everything you see u can touch and use it."
39443543,The trailers for this game don't do it justice. This game is a lot of fun. Needs more content though.
39431678,Some of the most fun sword fighting I've played in VR. This is a need to own in my oppinion.
39429977,"Pretty cool an immersive.  Not that long, but one of the only VR games that feels long enough to call a game and not a tech demo, even in 2018.  The sword fighting isn't that accurate, but still pretty awesome.  Really the only sword/shield game that I've played in VR that has decent content to it.  Even at full price, it's a huge deal compared to other VR titles."
39429593,I played this game for about 3 hours so far and it was about as good as expected so far.  I wasn't overly amazed but I was impressed.  The one thing that kept irritating me a tiny bit is that I'm left handed and it seemed clearly made for a right handed person.  I found myself reaching across my body to get my sword and shield in the correct hand.  that was pretty minor but the 2 handed weapons felt weird in my hands as well.  I still enjoyed the time I spent with it so far
39429571,"Definitely an interesting experience to start with, but held back by weak gameplay mechanics, as an experimental game developed by what I believe is a single person, it is good, however, the price tag, as with other VR games, is too steep.


The combat systems in the game certainly have some strong points; enemy armor and shields are reliable and interesting, melee combat is fun and the highly-telegraphed nature of all the moves allow ample time for even a new player to block an attack.

However, these all fall apart once movement gets involved, and while thumbstick-movement has been enabled in this game, a simple solution to all of these attacks is to walk backwards an inch, then walk forward as the enemy is winding down. Enemy arrows and projectiles become nothing but a reason to strafe back and forth as you throw arrows back at these enemies. Bosses desperately try to backpedal from you as you walk into them so that they can actually hit you, allowing the player to hold one joystick forward as they wiggle their wrist, defeating the enemy boss at little to no cost.

Enemy AI is also distressing; the first couple enemies will spawn in close to the player with an animation, but once this stops, enemies begin to show up standing lifelessly in plain view as they wait for the player to approach them; melee becomes a second thought as the ranged options of the game always overpower enemies who cannot or dare not approach, even with their occasional attempts to block and sidestep incoming arrows.

I have multiple other issues with this games' design, such as some assets not really matching the rest of the game or the gold system, but the aforementioned are the primary reasons.

Admittedly, as this is made by a small team, or single person, I couldn't say I expect them to cover all these bases, and I don't know how many of the mechanics in this game are stock unity assets from the store, but some of these systems are worth praise for a solo developer.

However, the size of the development team clearly hasn't affected the size of the hole in my pocket. This game is certainly not worth £15, nor do I think it's worth the £9 on sale; the rose-tinted goggles of VR itself have definitely lowered the bar of quality for games, because this game is certainly not deserving of its' overwhelmingly positive reviews.

"
39429079,"Overall, this is a fun adventure game that kept my interest. I felt invested in the plot and wanted to see more of the world. It is, however, short. I completed it in one evening (3-4 hours) and I am definitely NOT some kind of gaming maestro. You COULD go back and try to get all the achievements (objects collected, etc) but I personally won't - it doesn't have that kind of replay value for me.

In terms of gameplay, I like the style / design, but the movement dynamics could use a lot of work - half the time it didn't detect that I moved (Oculus, 3 sensors here) and any deaths were usually because it was taking me 20 seconds to get the thing to register my teleportation. Still fun, despite that frustration. 7/10, with points deducted for the teleportation problems and how short it is."
39428780,"Love of art style, the  gameplay is fun, and the enviroment is interesting to explore. Easily the best VR dungeon crawler that I've played so far."
39428193,"Remember Knightmare?  (if you're not in the UK, and not over 40... probably not...)

This is pretty much it.  74 mins in one session, I have no idea how far I am in, but I just fought may way into a large keep, currently on a quest for a fire wand.  And I'm knackered!

Excellent, yet simple combat?  Oh yes.  Like swords?  Good, you need to swing it quite often.  Parry?  Absolutely perfect.  Ok, the weapon blocking hit box is a little generous... put it down to being a master swordsman.. but hell if it isn't fun to not bother with the shield and just go toe to toe with some undead.

I hope this game is developed way past what there is right now, because quite frankly, I'm not sure I want to stop playing... 

Graphically, it's pretty simple - but then that obviously helps with the performance, which I had no issues at all.  Hand holding?  Hell no, you get some cryptic clues occasionally, but it's definitely up to you to figure stuff out, and it's great to actually have to think to solve the relatively simple, but not always obvious puzzles.

Climbing chains to reach hidden treasure is just another great addition to the game.  

This is VR done right.  Simple, yes.  It's hardly Skyrim - but it doesn't need or pretend to be, it's glorious in it's ease of play.  Could the pick up/drop controls be a little tighter? Maybe.  

All that's missing is a Dungeon Master to recite: Spellcasting.  D I S M I S S....."
39424779,"Wow, this has been one of my favorite VR game experiences yet! I enjoyed the gameplay! It is like being in an old school RPG in VR. VRPG!! Controls and inventory management work well. Graphics aren't overly complex, which works for the style and fluidity of the game. I like that achievements were added to continue the challenge. There is also a ""Hard"" challenge mode. Vanishing Realms is a sweet little VRPG. It's not super long, but just enough length. Highly recommended!"
39424373,Best VR RPG I've played yet!
39418132,"its not a bad start to vr role playing, tho its only one role lol.  but it looks great for a cartoon like game and my wife found it fun."
39417272,neeeeed more lvls!
39416826,"Game was fantastic, but there are some obvious problems too.
The gameplay is the BEST VR gameplay I've seen yet.
The game has no dialog/story
After you beat the game you have to create a new character to replay any content.
You can get blocked in progression in the game based on not having enough ingame money because you spent it on something else - The developer's ""Fix"" to this was to let you mine rocks for money if you get stuck. (not very elegant)
Would rate 4/5 stars because the gameplay is litterally that good."
39416550,"Great Experience, sadly extreme Short (~2 hours), but no Contentupdates since 2 Years, just unimportant bugfixes nobody needs. 
In retrospect i should have not payed more then 5 bucks.

Conclusion: Big Nope until it gets an appropriate campaign with at least 10 hours playtime for my initial 20 €."
39411589,"Play a role like a barbarian to smash your enemies then later switch up to a mage/caster to melt them.  

Playing Vanishing Realms was like reading a good book.  Good story, graphics, ..., everything.  I can't say a bad thing about the game.  It is ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" for a good reason.  

I am stingy (cheap ***) when it comes to buying games and this was definitely worth the buy.  If you get it on sale it is a steal.  This is one of those games you ""get into"", lose yourself in VR, and might hit your TV so watch those boundaries!

It took me just under six hours to complete it and that included trying to get places you probably were not supposed to go (you got to explore everything right?).
"
39408265,"Это просто великолепное творение! Какая атмосфера, какие бои! Какая приятная графика! А самое главное - игра поощеряет настоящих искателей! Не гнушайтесь обыскивать все углы для получения максимального профита!"
39407440,"Tons of fun and very immersive. 

The graphics are also tailored for the vive and do not look grainy like in FO4."
39404865,"One of the better VR games, get it."
39404612,Great game. Loved every minute of it.
39397860,"Vraiment excellent.
Graphismes, ambiances et combats sont très bien fait
 Seul bêmol l'absence de traduction française pour la partie énigme mais en fouillant partout on y arrive."
39378637,"Currently a great roleplaying game, some little bugs here and there, but ultimately in it's current state a fun adventure that I look forward to playing more of."
39341915,"This is a absolutely amazing game with tons of stuff to do like... epic boss battles, fight giants, get mad when theres a healer healing who your trying to kill, use things like magic, bows, axes, swords, shields, you can climb on chains, burn hay and get more money, fight in a arena, take a dragon egg after all undead bow to you, kill the king. And now I have to see a vanishing realms 2 with dragons and such."
39323660,This is one of the best games I've played with my Vive - really great - fun - and not to hard to learn - very natural to use and get into.  I hope there are more levels and add-ons for this at some point.
39311146,"Loved this experience. Incredible sense of presence and solidity (ducking under a scything blade was broke my 'VR presence cherry'. One of the first VR games I tried and still one of the best RPG VR game experiences 'out there'. Reminded me of Ultima Underworld the Stygian Abyss (from PC gaming history millions of years ago).

Any downside? Bit short. Very keen for a major DLC experience. Come on Indimo, I'm waiting to give you more money for a job well done.

Anything I'd love to see? Give us a body and support full body tracking please, as the added sense of presence is simply phenomenal (check out Island 365 beta full body tracking ... glitchy but very close). Fantasy games deserve full body tracking.

Thank you Indimo, keep it up."
39307036,Totally enjoyable. My young nephews and nieces enjoyed this as well they are around 10-12. Pretty good intro game for kids to play around in. It is short but no complaints tho.
39288862,"FINALLY got around to finishing this. I have to say, it is one of my favorite VR games now. 

The combat takes some getting used to. It can feel clunky at first, but during the game I grew to really like it. Sure, it's not perfect, but once you know how it works, it actually feels really cool to block or parry enemy's swings and hit him right in the weak spot. Enemies are invulnerable on armor and carry shields they know how to use, so you have to think a little to get hits in. Feels great if you manage to win a 1v2 flawlessly, or defeat some of the stronger enemies.
Ranged weapons are good, but I believe it is MUCH better with a decent play space. Moving furniture, I got to around 2m x 2m which was great. More is probably useless, since the game doesn't actually allow you to move freely, moving away from the center will pause the game. It can be annoying, but it was also helpful to stop me from running into walls. It still allows enough movement to dodge ranged attacks by sidestepping them or getting behind cover. Shooting an enemy while leaning out of cover is a cool thing too.

The world is built beautifully for VR, there's stuff to explore, things to interact with, and the path, while kinda linear, feels like a journey. The only part I disliked is the ""maze"", because it is very dark and VERY cramped. I'm sure that's what they were going for, because I have to admit, I was just too much of a pussy to play through it. It was scary for me, I had to have my wife next to me watching it to get through. Felt great to get out of it too! And actually using a torch in an rpg with your actual hand to light stuff up feels great too.

It's on the shorter side I guess, with 2.5 hours of play time for me for the normal story mode. There is a hard mode which I have yet to try. But the story was cool and left me wanting for more."
39275129,新改版有簡體中文，值得推薦。
39248276,I LOVE this game.  It's pretty fantastic.  I'm currently trying to figure out a RW canteen so I don't need to stop when I am thirsty.
39242483,"A blast. I cannot stress enough how fun it is in combat to actually, dynamically, parry and strike the weak points.

Like, the first enemy you fight has a helmet and a shield so from the get-go the hitbox for damage is small unless you time your swing with their attack.

Short campaign, only 3 hours of constant playing; but an absolute treat. ends on a cliffhanger so i figure chapter3 will come out eventually!"
39239222,"Absolutely brilliant, lost all sense of reality. This IS D and D in VR, a game for anyone with a VR headset! I used this on an Oculus Rift and it worked FLAWLESSLY, other than occasionally bumping into real things.

10/10 Can't wait to see what they've got for us next!"
39232272,"With the recent addition of non-Teleport locomotion, this is now one of top best VR games."
39183129,Best VR game I have played so far. Very immersive. I sure hope they make more!
39128245,"A modest videoludic experience but a really good foundation for what's to come next on VR. Vanishing Realms is a very short title with barely satisfying story telling and very little things to do actually. You'll follow a linear path filled with absolutely unchallenging yet somewhat ok fun puzzles and ennemies, you will have some moments of surprise too but nothing to be excited about. The worst is lack of interaction with any any form of entities or voice over to keep you under your wizard skin.

Playing the 1rst chapter I felt that the game does not give you any goals other than discovering what Dungeon Crawlers can do on VR. This is very true at least in the first chapter which does not have any enticing introdution to hook you up for the adventure to come, sucks that I have to read the not so generic intro, as soon as I read it I forgot it.

All the technical praises I heard and read for this game are legit for the most part. The locomotion is ok if you can tolerate to move that slowly when using the walking option, it's ok since you don't really have to walk long distances. You still have to ption to teleport but personally every time I play an Oculus game I am looking to avoid teleportation even though it's a potent sytem of locomotion that becomes very instinctive very quickly. The touch sytem is great nothing to say, good interface management as well. 

Vanishing Realms definitely marks a stepstone for Dungeon crawlers on VR but it's way too little especially for its selling price to satisfy an experienced gamer looking for a minimum of exciting gameplay and difficulty. This game has everyhing it needs on the surface but lacks the depth which I think is crucial for this type of games (Dungeon Crawlers) especially when it comes to interacting with other entities."
39104317,"A well-designed first-person RPG. It's early access and you can tell, but there's still quite a bit to do and discover. If you like RPGs, this is a good one for VR."
39081893,"Thank you so much dev for making this game. I thoroughly enjoyed it! This was an incredible immersive experience and exactly the kind of pure joy you want to feel from VR. I look forward to replaying this game again and showing my friends who I know will love it. I’ll definitely spread the word to anyone I know that has VR. I can't wait for the next chapter. If it's the same quality then I think it's more than fair to charge, as I definitely believe in quality over quantity. Considering such a small dev team, very Impressive. Thank you again."
39071768,"How is this not the top VR seller?!?!

I don't often do anything with reviews but this deserves a positive one.  Like others have been saying it is so immersive you forget where you are in the room or where you are facing.  This is the beginning of the future of RPGs and VR!"
39066178,"Reminded me of my favorite old game - Heretic. I wish there were more games as fun as this one. 
Works well on Windows Mixed Reality headset."
39062386,I want much much more of this!!! NOW!
39046537,"Excellent VR game that seems to get ignored too often. A good 4 hour or so campaign with really good controls that'll leave you feeling like you really have gone toe to toe with the undead.

"
39019999,"Wunderbar wie intuitiv und GENIAL hier alles umgesetzt wurde :) - Klettern macht Spass, ausweichen, egal was, es wurde alles ziemlich genial umgesetzt... Mehr Levels dazu und Story.. Vielleicht Coop/PVP und wir haben hier das BESTE RPG VR Spiel überhaupt :)"
38992820,"Short but very promising. I was immersed enough to scream when a mob jumped out of a crate, and I punched my ceiling jumping to grab treasure."
38992017,"Can't recommend this for oculus rift, because the controls work really poorly.
1. Grabbing items is pretty unintuitive, because you grab the item with the trigger button and release it by holding the grip button for one second.
2. You walk way too slow in this game and to walk in a reasonable pace you have to hold the thumbstick down. And this just starts to hurt after a few seconds.

If these control issues are fixed, than I'd buy it again. But I had to refund it."
38961049,this game is awesome
38960536,Vanishing Realms is a REALLY good rpg and makes me very excited to see what is next for RPGs in VR however it is a bit short. If it is on sale I would definitely recommend it but if it is full price I would only recommend it if you love RPGs.
38960484,"Short, but really fun!"
38944056,Fantastic Game and well worth it!  But it is short -- Four hours to finish on Normal difficulty.
38937406,"This was one of my earliest purchases, and I loved it.  They patched it over the past year to add a higher difficulty. I checked this out and got into 8 minute sword fights with the orcs and loved it.  

I have not played every adventure game that has come out on the Vive but this one offers polish, awe in exploration, RPG elements of loot and money collection, and a narrative that exists. 

I loved this experience and as of right now I still recommend it.
"
38925269,"Very engaging.  Haven't tried hard mode yet, but normal's combat wasn't too bad once you got the hand of it.  I do wish combat was a bit more responsive to impacts, but it was still well done in vr and very enjoyable.  I beat the normal mode in one night in about 2 1/2 hours, and this i felt was one of my first vr games that felt like a full game using vr to full potential. 
Loved it from start to finish, and can't wait to see what future content is comes to this game!"
38916529,"Amazing! This is easily my favorite VR experience so far.

I highly recommend getting a 3rd Oculus Constellation Sensor so you can get the full room-scale experience, as you can get turned around and a 2 sensor setup just cant calculate your direction as effectively. That said, it is playable and enjoyable with 2 sensors.

Buy this game. Enjoy."
38890841,"This is one of the first games I bought for my Vive and it's STILL the best VR game on Steam two years later.  Nothing has transported me to another world as effectively as Vanishing Realms.  This is truly one of the very few ""killer app"" VR games."
38887734,"果实放在嘴边是可以吃的 可以回血

苹果树上的苹果可以用弓箭射下来

射苹果太好玩了

能不能多来几颗苹果树？"
38823161,"That is what VR is meant for. Everything is optimised for motion controls: inventory intuitive, responsive weapons, interacting with the world feels natural. The AI seems to be clever while strafing away, ducking and blocking. Sword and bow fightings are just great! Desperatly waiting for DLCs. Very nice game."
38777646,"tl;dr: You can interact with many items, inventory and fighting system is solid. Graphics are low spec friendly and the game itself is vr beginner friendly.

8/10


I have the Rift for a few days now and after The Lab and Space Pirate Trainer, this was the first ""real"" title I played within VR.
I played for 3h now and have finished the storyline/ the game. For me it was pure immersion and I'm happy I don't get nausea of teleporting around, meaning it's vr beginner friendly. The first part is ""just"" exploring, but it introduces you well into the gameplay mechanics and for it was fun because I found some hidden gold lying around. I was pretty scared as I made contact with the first skeleton enemy and gave me a pretty high adrenalin rush to fight it. 
I would say the game itself makes a really good job to be immersive. I constantly got the force break because I was so off of my middle of the playground. Which means I got lost in it, not thinking about my real room. 

I'm sad I have to wait for the next chapter to come out, would like to have more."
38756204,"Quite fun, recommended."
38739516,"Longest I've played a standing game yet and quite a feat for a standing game with the sweaty face/ aching feet and all. The combat is engaging, the inventory management is top notch and the world is well designed. GOOD JOB to the devs. The only gripes I have are:

The Sprint option should be faster, as well as one click of the thumb stick, not held down.

The handling for the wand and really moreso the two handed axe on the rift is super wonky. I wanna master the axe but it just seems like the basic swords do the job easiest since you're able to take advantage of openings more frequently.

Other than that fantastic game. It's on sale for 13$ right now and easily a must have in my book for any VR owner."
38737360,Best Vr experience so far
38726950,"Really cool game, controls feel good, it looks nice and runs smoothly. Love getting to pick almost everything up and move around. So far its my favorite game for my Vive."
38709700,это то что нужно для vr на oculus играется просто прекрасно жаль что только на 2 часа)) если бы вышло продолжение купил бы не раздумывая за вдвое большую цену)))
38677157,Ce jeux est Excellent ! il vaut vraiment la peine. Il est le parfait jeu d'avanture VR :D
38608404,"Like every other VR game. Played for a little bit, got bored."
38598129,really fun and tightly made rpg. Good difficulty without being unfair. rewards getting better
38513610,"Really well done game, feels like a fantasy world, and the combat is good exercise!

HIGHS

+ Good Combat
+ Fun Gameplay
+ Good no marker puzzles that are fun to solve
+ Climbing support
+ Decent Inventory UI
+ Good interactivity
+ Good music and sound


LOWS
- The Inventory is nicely set up, but moves around when you least want it to.
- The bow is kind of childlike, I wish it had a faster projectile,  I bought the more expensive one with this in mind.
- Smooth locomotion speed is too low. ""Sprint"" Is a medium paced walk. Walk is a creep. I end up having to warp if I need to travel long distances.
- Some enemies don't seem to react when you swing at legs

Do yourself a favor and swing the swords like sabers along with poking. Don't just poke like in the game play video because it's kind of boring.
I bought the more expensive bow hoping that I could have a better arrow velocity. I was disappointed.


It may be prudent to let you grab a ""belt"" so that your belt doesn't rotate it when you don't want it to.

Adding additional combat mechanics for targeting limbs would take the combat to the next level."
38493367,"Wow, this game is great!  I haven't finished it yet, but I feel like this is exactly the type of game I had in mind when VR first became a thing.  This is the early version of the type of games which will make VR amazing. I love this so far and highly recommend it."
38484893,"le Zelda-like VR qu'on attendait, il est là. Après y'à pas vraiment d'histoire, c'est l'ambiance qui fait tout le taf et quel boulot !! un incontournable pour commencer en VR !!"
38446319,"I highly recommend this game, it's super immersive. Finished the first dungeon and had a blast. I really enjoy the riddles/puzzles in the dungeons/game. I also really enjoy the combat in the game. Buying this game is a no-brainer, especially since its on sale ($13.99)."
38443767,"This is a great VR game for everyone! A must have no matter who you are.

Me, a guy that plays games regularly, really enjoyed it, even though I got through all the content in a little over two hours.

My fiance and roommates on the other hand, not gamers, have been obsessed with playing this game, I can't get my VR back from them! Neither of them like games, nor fantasy to say the least, but they are completely engrossed in this game.

Again, a must have!"
38442840,"Really good game, little quantity to play but amazing quality.  It looks really bad but for some reason it is spectacular."
38404226,"Vanishing Realms is simply outstanding. Room-scale VR adds so much when solving vaguely Zelda-like puzzles. My first few swordfights with giant skeletons made my heart pound, and that feeling returned when I played again in hard mode."
38403905,Please make more of these.  Really enjoying this one.
38400599,"어두컴컴한 분위기가 쪼끔 무섭지만 던전 RPG를 충실히 구현해놨습니다.
굴러다니는 과일을 줏어서 주머니에 담고, 체력이 모자랄때 꺼내서 그걸 입으로 가져가서 먹을떄면
마치 스카이림 안에 들어가서 직접 플레이를 하는것 같은..
어차피 길은 정해져있는 전형적인 RPG입니다. 쭉 깨시고 엔딩 보시면 됩니다.
개인적인 팁은 돈을 열심히 모아야 합니다.."
38397301,"Vanishing Realms ne va probablement jamais sortir de l'early access. Rien que pour ça j'ai envie de mettre un ""non recommandé"".
Mais pourtant, Vanishing Realms est une expérience exceptionnelle. Court, mais un niveau d'immersion tellement efficace qu'il devrait servir de standard, de bible pour beaucoup d'autres jeux VR.
Je l'ai fait 3 fois je crois, je le referai sûrement. 10/10 en immersion et plaisir."
38394635,"I'm always a little skeptical of Early Access games, but this one is good...very good.
It completely draws you in, you'll think you're crawling through a dungeon instead of standing in a living room. My friend got ambushed by an archer, and he ducked and took a step back to hide behind a wall; later he was trying to reach something, couldn't quite make so he jumped and smashed the controller into the ceiling, no harm done.
Drawing the bow is so close to real that you feel phantom resistence.
That's how much this game draws you in. And lets talk about options...
Lefyt? Sword in the left hand, shield in the right.
Dual Wielding, check...kill those boxes and barrels in one swipe.
Bow and arrow for a pseudo-stealthy archer, check and unlimited arrows. Angle and draw effect arrow range and arc.
Want to be ""the one"", put a sword in each hand and Neo out of the way of all incoming attacks.

Hit boxes are on point. A hard, fully extended jab to an armored area will do damage, whereas a light fast jab to the same area will do no damage; but if you hit an unarmored area, you get full damage with just a light hit.

We didn't get far enough to try out magic, so no comment.

One thing...I like how mobs don't aggro out of their area...but if I'm beating on them from a distance...they should come at me.

Hopefully now that the refactor is done, we'll see more content in the coming year. Even if not, at $20 this game is totally worth it."
38393430,"Probably my favorite VR game, and the one I most want to get a sequel.

Its like if Zelda were a vr game. It has everything you'd imagine. Skeleton monsters, swords, bow and arrow, sheilds, all with very good controls. Infact the controls are probably the best I've ever seen in VR. Everything from putting an apple in your pouch, to shooting a wizard in the face feels so intuivite and nice. I wish superhot had throwing physics this intuitive. Watch out if you have a low ceiling though.

The axe and the enemy types are my only complaints. The two handed axe feels off, and there are only a few enemies types before the game just shrugs and starts reskinning the same things with more health. But a couple really solidly designed monster types is much better than a thousand badly made ones. So its a fair trade off. Especially for a 20 dollar VR game with amazing visuals and gameplay.

Highly recommend. If I could only show someone on game on VR, I'd pick this one."
38391045,"This game is simply a must buy VR experience, I enjoyed playing every minute of this game. The atmosphere makes you feel like your in an rpg...The only things that im let down on is that every now and then the inventory and stats become a bit blurry because i have to look down, every now and then an enemy goes through a wall or two and that their needs to be more content. Hopefully these issues will be fixed soon as i LOVE this game and i'd like to play more of it."
38366943,"What a frickin riot. Being an old ""hack and slash"" gamer in his late 50's, I have to tell you that this was a total blast. At first I was wondering (and worried) if I would be able to save my progress, but I soon found that there were save points in areas that made sense. 
The tracking is on point, my arrows hit exactly where I aimed them. Felt great.
The endgame was a trip. Making it throught the challenges had me literally sweating and looking around for whatever was coming next. 
Although not a true RPG in the sense of an open world goliath, the game gave me a great sense of what was coming in VR. The graphics are tight and the item menu's are intuitive and extremely easy to navigate, even during harried battle action. 
The graphics are outstanding. 
If you are new to VR and want an outstanding experience with a sword and bow, there is nothing beter out there."
38362445,"i want to die, just 2 chapters for now.  :-( 
btw i really enjoyed this experience, felt like i was playing in zelda. really short but really worth for now.

update 08/09/2019
update. i bought this in early acces, and now the chapter 3 is sold separatly, really don't like this attitude. so disappointed now."
38340239,I want more chapters damn it!
38280013,"Highly polished and varied, but short and with little replay value. Recommend buying it on a sale."
38261287,"This is a great game!  It's fun to play on Oculus.  The only changes I would like to see are 1) instead of making the player turn sound to fight monsters behind them, have a button turn you around.  That way the sensors will have full vision of you while fighting.   Presently, I have died a few times cause the weapons I'm holding aren't moving since I have my back to the sensors.  2)  Have a button that extends the reach of an arm.  Often my sensors aren't picking up close to the ground., so when I reach, the ""pickup ball is 1/2 inch off the object and freezes.  Sometimes by bobing up and down, I can trick it into picking up the object.  Even with these 2 problems, it's a great game.  Very fun killing monsters!"
38201280,It's my favorite vr game.  It immersed me into the realm.  The control felt intuitive which allows me to experience rather than fuss with the game.  The cartoonish environment was fun.
38170076,"Man I love this game. This is like a hybrid of Zelda, Ultima Underworld and D&D. The ability to manipulate your environment is vastly superior in this game to other VR dungeon crawlers that I've tried. The feeling of combat is just right (maybe a little more feedback from the controller when blocking or striking but otherwise great). If I had to nitpick, I'd say I would prefer just tapping the right stick to snapturn as opposed to holding it down and moving it left or right. That makes your thumb really sore after extended play. Also, just a personal preference, but I prefer using a button on the right controller for teleport as in most other games that support teleportation. Those could be easily added as options I would imagine. Maybe a little bit better save management would be nice. Other than that, this game is a masterpiece. It is exactly what I always dreamed a VR dungeon crawler could be. I love the scrolls you find and the way you handled secrets, traps and puzzles. The atmosphere is spot on. Very old school but in a really welcome way. It almost feels like you're playing an early Moldvay-Cook D&D module. (I know...I really dated myself there).

If you ever create a sequel I'd love to see classes to choose from, even more interactivity (maybe NPCs, more formalized quests etc). Cannot wait to try the next chapters. Keep them coming forever! I don't mind paying more to continue playing this gem. You should be proud of yourself. Anyone on the fence about this game, doubtful anyone would be at this point with its amazing history and reviews, buy it now. Do not wait. Btw, if it matters I am playing it on the Rift and I have absolutely no problems (minus my preferences as stated earlier)."
38168772,"UN EXCELENTE JUEGO, DESARROLLO INTUITIVO Y BASTANTE INMERSIVO."
38131528,"immersive, fun, npc are smarter when I thought they would be, on hard difficulty they even parry, evade and try to get you from the side. Story is neat with some discovery, mystery and riddles. unfotunately too short :) played it for almost 10 hour to get to end of chapter 2. Seems to be the end currently."
38122031,"Really fun game, not a lot of playability as with most of these vr games. in game achievements but no steam achievements. for a vr game i imagine they've put a lot of work into it, however its lacking if you are comparing it the a AAA sytle rpg. Would like to see a longer quest line and more playability, more enemies would be nice, as well as harder puzzles. they could definetly imrpove upon the arrow shooting to be more like ""the lab"" as well as improve the awkward battle axe."
38060268,"Some of the things are pretty basic, but the game is well made and gameplay is good.
Played through at a regular difficulty. Enjoyed it"

If you're reading this, then you likely haven't played this game yet for some reason.  You need to remedy that immediately.  Like, stop reading reviews and go buy this thing.

Vanishing Realms is [i]the[/i] game that's mentioned every time a dungeon crawler or RPG in VR is mentioned.  And for good reason.  The game is highly polished and incredibly fun.  if you're worried about the pricetag, don't be.  It's worth every penny.  This is the game that all the others in this genre are trying to imitate.

[b][u]Value - 7[/u][/b] - The only reason I didn't give it a higher score, is that I realize the price is kind of high.  Also, even though the game is tons of fun, it is a tad short (shouldn't take more than a couple of hours for a first playthrough, and they can be done in maybe 45 minutes after that).  Replayability is a bit on the low side as well.

[b][u]Originality - 10[/u][/b] - As I said before, this has become the standard for this adventure genre in VR.  There's some similar types of games in non-VR (perhaps Skyrim... but more linear.. a good example isn't coming to mind).  

[b][u]Controls - 10[/u][/b] - Pretty much every imaginable control scheme has been implemented at this point.  You've got teleportation, gliding, umm... some others (a combo of teleportation and glide is all I use).  Sword fighting (and archery) are both well done.  Movement is smooth, and hits on the enemies are accurate.

One thing in particular I thought was fun, was if you're at a place where a melee enemy can't reach you and are shooting it with arrows, after a hit or two they begin side-stepping your arrows.  It's still possible to hit them, but it makes for a difficult tactic.

Also, after a bit you get a mining pick and these little ore nodes become another source of income.  Mining them is quite fun and feels very Minecraft-y... but there's not so many nodes that it becomes tedious.

[b][u]Graphics - 8[/u][/b] - The graphics are a bit cartoony, but it works.  Generally, I prefer a cartoony look to badly-done realism.  Gives a nice buffer where you can excuse things that aren't quite right.  Enemy models aren't overly stiff, and move well; although combat feels a little basic.  The terrain layout and textures are good as well.

[b][u]Sound - 7[/u][/b] - Sound is ok.  Sounds effects are what they need to be.  Enemies yell at you a little and make some noise.  I can't recall if there's background music or not (which I suppose isn't a good sign).  I don't recall if there's ambiance sound effects either.

[b][u]Fun - 10[/u][/b] - The game is pretty good at making you feel like a badass with a sword and shield.  Enemies are just tough enough (unless you're a Gorn expert... in which case combat won't be too difficult).  There's a good mix of melee skeletons, archers, spell casters, and giants to fight.  You end up armed with a sword and shield, bow, fireball wand, and 2-handed axe (which is a bit difficult to get the hang of... and again having played Gorn would be helpful here).  

[b][u]Overall - 10[/u][/b] - You spend just enough time exploring and poking around in boxes and burning piles of leaves/straw on the floor looking for treasure with interspersed combat to keep things from getting to tedious or boring.  Level layout is good.  Just complex enough in places to make you feel a little lost, without being too difficult to actually find your way through.  

Do yourself a favor and make this game happen."
38041777,Love this game. easy enough to beat in a couple hours. Well worth the $20. I have replayed it several times and my whole family loves it.
38036035,"+zelda like adventure
-to short"
38000893,This is the best immersion game I have played.  I became part of the story.  There are several choices for movement and improvements  are a constant. so yeah Thumbs up.
37987024,"Sur Oculus => Les contôles sont tip top, trés bon feeling. Un vrais plaisir d'étre dans un donjon. Gros plus pour l'arc trés sympa à jouer.  les mob restent faciles aprés 1heure de jeu."
37971980,"Perhaps one of the best Vive games out there. Feels polished and well-concieved.

Basically it's more or less linear dungeon crawler / simplish RPG, sure, but it does everything soo well compared to other VR games. The inventory system is excellent and still simple to use, the combat feels right and makes you move in room space a bit swinging sword or taking covers from enemy arrows, the level design allows for some movements to grab items out of reach/behind stone pillar etc. Movement can be both teleportation (feels ok in here) and touchpad. Extra point for very nice chaperon implementation where moving too fast or swinging too fast outside of boundaries pauses the game and forces player to re-center.

Graphics are a bit on cartoonish side style wise (it's usually BIG no-no for some like me) but in VR it works creating nice and immersive for most parts fairytale environment.

There are some little puzzles here but this title begs for more physics based ones IMO.

Haven't completed, people say it's short like most VR games tend to be -but apparently it's the base Author will build on additional content.

Thumbs up!"
37970981,Very cool game! Thanks again..
37967013,"Just amazing.  A lot of the stuff out for Vive right now aren't proper games, you know? Doesn't mean they are bad, but they aren't things you sit through your day waiting to play.  On my list of such titles are: Arizona Sunshine, Raw Data, House of the Dying Sun, and now, Vanishing Realms.

It's a must have for a Vive owner, go get it!"
37947424,"Great game after a bunch of bug fixes.
Can't wait for the next chapters."
37929428,"Wow! What a wonderful game. Although the first two chapters can be finished in a couple of hours, every damn minute of this wonderful (Zelda-like) action oriented RPG is just fantastic entertainment. I had so much fun shooting arrows at flying wizards, chopping my sword at bulky skeletons and blocking crossbow bolts of undead archers with my trusty shield. 

Vanishing Realms is a full room experience. You need that extra space to fight, dodge, parry and slash at anything that comes your way. You can duck behind cover, crawl under perilous blade traps on hands and knees and hoist yourself up on ropes and chains. There is tons of hidden treasure to collect (although it's very easy to max out on the gear you can purchase), some light puzzles to solve and a big dungeon te explore. Stalking through the labyrinthine tunnels, my shield raised for anything that might jump out of the shadows while I was keeping an eye out for traps, was just an overal great experience and one of my best moments I've had in VR so far. 

And while it is not perfect (I'd like to see more RPG influences, a less linear setting, maybe some NPC interaction and even more different locations) Vanishing Realms is a complete and polished VR experience. I never ran into any glitches or errors. Above all else, Vanishing Realm really shows the wild potential of VR. I can't wait to sink my little runesword and teeth in the next chapters when they arrive!"
37910090,"I recently bought my Vive, and this was one of the first games I bought (thank you reviewers). Finished first part in 4.3 hours, and it was the most fun time Iv had playing in a long time. This game ALONE made purchasing the Vive worth it.  A bit short of course but in that little time they packed in exploration, fighting and even mining..  go get the game.. NOW!"
37900140,"Surprisingly, this game helps me forget some of the concerns I have for the future of VR gaming and the money I've already spent. It showcases the technology's interactive potential well and makes adventuring fun."
37846611,"Ya veo por qué la mayoría de análisis son positivos. El juego está muy bien logrado, nada de hacer trampa atravezando paredes al caminar, no te lo permite y te tira para atras. Me he tenido que agachar para que no me corten al medio unas cuchillas!!! ... impresionante. 

El combate es interesante, la IA no está mal, aunque a veces son un poco torpes los enemigos. Si están lejos se quedan quietos, entonces se los puede achurar con arco y flecha sin correr riesgos. Eso podrían mejorarlo.
Otras veces te salen muy cerca y no queda otra que ir a los bifes. 

Todavia no lo termine, creo que me queda bastante por hacer, por el momento me encantó.

Recomiendo un ventilador prendido o aire acondicionado, porque a veces te hace transpirar un poco :D"

37836220,"It might have been impressive more than a year ago when VR was new, but the game shows it's age very fast.

The combat is barely passable and the level design is hideous. Very poor immersion."
37740737,Great Game! Super Fun! Great visuals! Weapons are cool and combat too. Looking foward to future games.
37665013,"Looking for sword fighting, some magic, one hand, dual wield, shield, two hand, bow. Best sword mechanics rpg for VR as far as I found. 

To sum up , yes, must have for VR.

Movement teleportation or pad or both at same time. Inventory to store items, different enemies, not too much not too little. End boss. Finished in 2 hours. Realy enjoyable."
37577086,This is the best game on the VIve. After I played this I have been looking for a comparable experience on the Vive I have yet to find one.
37481818,This was a pretty rad game. I wish it had lasted longer though. I just finished it at 2.8 hour mark without any sort of completionism... just a straight playthrough. Also wish that you walk faster. so slow. there was a sprint button but trying to hold down the thumbstick for any length of time can get painful.
37427925,"Ce jeu m'a convaincu d'acheter un casque VR
Très bon ; on a hâte de découvrir les prochains chapitres"
37221988,I didnt get to play long since my play area is too small but this game is probably one of the most immersive ive played yet. Its amazing and cant wait for my 3rd sensor to get here and going to make more room for play area.
37111746,"Ein tolles Spiel, welches richtig Spaß macht. Wenn man zum ersten Mal in einem Spiel Größenverhältnisse von Gegnern erkennt, dann hier. Auch die Gänge erforschen, mit der Fackel in der erhobenen Hand, kreiert eine tolle Atmosphäre."
36974725,"This game is great. My only problem with it is the bow and how it works. Something about it feels so wrong. I didn't have this problem playing other bow games like The Lab bow game or Quivr. It feels laggy and a bit unresponsive.

Picking items can be a bit easier. Like, having to individually pick up coins is tideous. I think having them gravitate to you when you get close enough will work better. People shouldn't have to individually pick up every single coin. Also when picking up an item like an apple, it should work like coins in my opinion. It should just automatically go to the inventory without having to manually click again. Just clicking once to pick it up should be enough to have it go automatically to your inventory.

These are my issues. Other than that, the game is very very well made. I specifically like how solid the game is, I like all the boundaries the game has in place to prevent it from being a cheap VR experience, for example you can't look through walls, you can't cheat kill enemies. Highly recommended for an Early Access game.
"
36948848,"Still my favorite VR experience. This is not a quick demo that you give to people who try VR. This is the best immersive experience when you have a couple hours to get lost in an adventure.

So many great VR ideas in this game; inventory belt, using the torch, breaking pots for gold (Zelda), teaching you not to walk through walls/tables, progression of weapons, fun puzzles, world/dungeon design...

NOTE: My hours played is higher since I have played under my work & home account."
36934522,Blown away. VR was made for games like this.
36825122,"Una delle migliori esperienze VR di sempre, un po' corto..."
36674227,I found Vanishing realms to be an Awesome VR Experience! I highly recommend it!
36637008,"This is hands down, the best VR experience I have played so far. Plenty of locomotion options that make it easy to use, combat encourages a actual sword fighting style instead of ""wii-waggling"" and I found myself drawn to continue. 

On the negative side, it is short. I finished this in 3 hours. There is a hard mode and achievements but The main story was 3 hours for me. I feel like the price is fair, I've paid more for much lamer corn mazes... 

I really look forward to seeing more from these developers. 
"
36612925,Brilliant! I want more!
36611359,The best dungeon crawler in VR... Zelda meets VR. Must buy!
36599122,"So while I recommend the game it's with a few caveats:

1. This was one of the first VR games to come out, was decent then and is decent now.
2. There is no story to speak of, it's more of a light-weight dungeon walk-through.
3. If there were more (or any) truly ""great"" VR games then I probably wouldn't recommend this.
4. My children like this game more than I do so maybe it's btter for kids?

Anyway, did a playthrough got my money's worth and the family does like it so overall it's worth the dough. Seriously though, for such a strong start I'm dissappointed with the lack of progress in key gaming elements."
36585735,My first RPG VR game. I love it. The first monster I came across made me almost run away in RL. The first act is my favorite so far.
36531912,"not to much replay but what a play through ,,cant wait to see where this goes"
36512153,"Quite fun, works with first-timers too, if they are into rpgs and stuff."
36507894,"excellent jeu! on attend la suite!
mais ca fait bien longtemps qu'on l'attend ceci dit...

en attendant ca reste un des meillers RPG en VR
"
36506857,"It's a fun game with great graphics. Well worth a few bucks to experience the world.

Combat is way too easy though. I only died on the one boss who is even mildly challenging. Although I prefer hard games most of the time. The collecting was really cool when you use your pickaxe, but ultimately the game is over before anything you collect really matters."
36484808,"WOW! for a while I thought the dev abandoned this WONDERFULLY put together game.  But after months of not hearing anything he has surfaced with some great new features that makes what I consider to be the number 1 adventure game using VR even better. And the fact that he now says he is in fact working on new chapters is great news. Can't wait to buy those as well.  $19.99 is so worth the price of this quest. No need to wait for sale, (don't think it ever goes on sale anyway!), get it now and have some fun!  And for those that blast through the game on easy or normal in a couple of hours, play the new warrior mode and get some real enjoymnet out of it!"
36480411,"VR gives you a lot of goosebumps and wow moments. Vanishing Realms is one of them. A bit short for now, but still longer than a lot of other VR games. The feeling of weapons is great, even if ennemys could benefit of a better AI or a bit more combat options. The world looks great, and the last update made the game even more immersive and bug free!

If you have a Vive, put this game on your wishlist, and give it a try whenever you have the time!"
36431259,"Very fun game with a great art style and tight controls.  Light on story, but has some exploration.  Only takes 3 or 4 hours to complete, but it's pretty fun.  The second chapter feels kinda like a cop-out, where it's just a gauntlet of fighting all the enemies you've already faced, but the first chapter is a lot of fun.  It's a solid intro to VR and a pretty good game on it's own.  Definitely recommend if you have a VR."
36331870,"There isn't much left to say about this that hasn't already been said. I enjoyed it. My friends enjoyed it. It's pretty much one of the staple games of the VR community now.

Give it a go!"
36318707,"In a time where it feels like most VR games are tech demos, shooting galleries, or ""stand-in-a-room-and-interact-with-stuff"" simulators, this is the first (and only) VR game I've played so far that feels like an actual GAME. There's stuff to explore, enemies to fight, and I, at least, have been having endless fun with it.

The other VR game types listed above have their own value, merit, and entertainment factor, but this one really sets itself apart in all the right ways."
36285945,"Completely badass and what VR games should hope to achieve.  Shields?  Who needs shields?  Duel wield!  2H weapons seem glitched with the new adversary tracking, but overall pretty cool!

Evolution means a new game each time you play!"
36276013,Fun so far and a good early VR experience. Significantly improved with a bigger play space. I need to make a little more space and spend more time in it.
36196857,"The game might be good, but the Oculus support feels very half assed.

The grabbing and throwing feels unnatural and turning doesn't work very well. I can't even access parts of the menu because turning is disabled there."
36181922,"Possibly the best VR game on the market, definitely the best “sword fighter” vr Game available."
36176619,"Bonjour tous le monde,

36073890,Una bella avventura..!  Dopo un anno ancora rimane un bel gioco...
35982987,"to be honest, i was disapointed... not by the fact i paid 20 dollars for 3 hours of fun, but the fact that it was a dungeon crawler and greatly wanted some sort of classic RPG, build your skills up with lots of loot to shift through game. Even the chapter 2 felt like a shoe horned element that was suppose to be some sort of replay value end game. but everything started to become predictable and made me say ""Is that it..."" as i got to the end. 

If i was to say what this game really is, Id have to say its is a text based story adventure with hack and slash, You'll get new weapons if you pick up gold, but over all you can beat the game with the first sword you get, and a bow, forcing you to just push threw the game. If your worried about inventory, it doesnt really matter, If you want more dmg, it doesnt really matter, If you want a difficulty, it doesnt really matter. all that matters is getting to the end of the game. and having fun doing it.

If your like me and just wanted a dungeon crawler with tons of loot, micro managing weapons, Visiting a shop for upgrades or selling loot, some sort of feeling of having a game plan when running into the enemy, or even a feeling of longevity to play the game, I wouldnt reccomend this game, its just another story driven game like the rest of the VR games out there.

35926472,"Das beste VR-Spiel, das ich bisher gespielt habe!
Stimmungvoll gezeichnet, gute, intuitive Spielmechanik, motivierend, die richtige Mischung aus Kämpfen und Entdecken. Unbedingt zu empfehlen!

Mein einziger Verbesserungsvorschlag: Eine Funktion, um im Spiel die Bodenhöhe anzupassen, falls einen die VIVE mal wieder schweben lässt und man keine Items vom Boden aufheben kann."
35858749,Tolles VR Game!
35814079,"Such an awesome game. I can't wait to try the new updates. And even though I've played this with only teleportation so far, it is one of the best, most satisfying teleportation methods out there, and makes me almost not care that there was no free locomotion up until recently (and I just found out in the news on this game's page, after not having played this title for a while, since I have played it so much in the past)...and I don't prefer teleportation games where free locomotion should exist in such a world as ths game has. So again, I can't wait to try it, but I guess I could wait to give this review. Just knowing that it's so good with my least favorite form of locomotion, with teleporting...says a lot. 

Well, anyway,  I just felt like leaving a simple review and recommend this whole heartedly.  What an amazing experience. It is one of the most immersive VR games I've played, and I'm not a big RPG guy either.  This makes the PRG simple and yet gives options and room for more later, but plenty to be very satisfied with. 

Very cool art style too. Sure, it's not as detailed as some games, such as Batman VR, but at least this one does not miss the mark in giving you awesome combat, right in your face."
35812266,"It's a pretty epic dungeon crawler -  pretty, fun, and I would definitely buy it again. I can't say enough good stuff about it. 

The premise is simple - you creep around a dungeon (and sometimes the outdoors), avoiding traps, fighting skeletal warriors and archers, and hunting for treasure (both obvious and inobvious). You can buy better gear when you find enough gold, and there are a few boss fights. 

The graphics are not too scary; I think ages 9 - 109 could play this game. It's a very good looking game, and has inside and outdoors locations to explore. The AI is not super sophisticated - I wouldn't call this a hardcore game by any means, but it's challenging enough to be fun without being terribly frustrating.

It's not gory, and though it does have a startle or two in it.

One good feature is that if you get to close to the boundaries of your roomscale space, it will paus e the game, and let you re-center yourself before continuing. When you are swinging a sword, this is an essential feature!

It's not terribly long, but it's long enough to be worth the price, and you'll play it more than once. Also,  you'll make your friends play it when they come over, because it's easy to grasp as a game, it's fun, and it's visually impressive without overtaxing your graphics card.

Instant classic. If you have a VR system, you really should have this in your collection."
35806484,"I liked this game.  I haven't played many VR titles, but I hope the good ones are at least this good.  Like Zelda for VR.  Not a full fledged game, but there is enough content to keep me busy for several hours.  I loved the immersion, going through a dungeon, monster comes out, gotta scramble to put away torch and grab my swords.  Just like I imagine I would feel actually doing it.  Tons of fun, hope they make more chapters."
35806245,"This is by FAR the best VR game I own. Literally nothing will surpass this.
If you have ever wanted to do a dungeon crawl, this game is for you.
If you have ever wanted to be your DND character, this game is for you.
If you have ever wanted to just hack and slash the <3 out of bad guys, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!
Have I made my point yet? THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!

So stop reading the reviews and buy the game already!"
35789281,"This game is awesome! I love vr with cute cartoony style graphics. This takes that and expands on it by having good AI and a great battle machanic.

I had such a great time trying to thrust into enemies while running into my walls in the real world.

I recomend this game for anyone on the fence. I have already gifted this to a friend myself."
35783743,"A phenomenal game that is blends slightly cartoony graphics with incredible realism. The game is visually stunning and the ambience truly immerses you into the world.

The combat is well designed and fluid. All of the weapons felt natural to use my favourite being the 2H axe! While it is a short game it was some of the best time I've spent playing a video game in some time. If you have a Vive and do not own this game you are seriously missing out.

10/10"
35752688,"BEST GAME FOR VR IN A YEAR!
THINK ZELDA IN VR"
35739378,"Could be longer and more challenging, but it is a whole lot of fun.  I'm not sure what combat mechanics people were complaining about but I really enjoyed sword and board combat.  The two handed axe was a bit wonky though.  You eventually get a wand, but it's right at the end of the game so you don't get to use it much.  It made me very exictied for the future of RPGs in VR"
35728455,This is bar none the best adventure VR game on the market.
35714366,"Тачи на окулусе не работают как надо, не могу поворачиваться на стики, предмет выбросить из руки не могу сразу, приходится несколько раз жать на кнопку. Не знаю может быть у меня у одного такие проблемы но функция поворота на тачи есть в опциях но не работает"
35669396,Possibly the best game in VR.  The most immersive dungeon crawler game in existence.  Can't wait for the sequel...
35647446,"Purchased before the big 2017 update but it was still worth it then, I only imagine the performance has gone way up. While a little short, this dungeon crawler is very engaging and immersive. It's a little buggy but much better than any of the other RPG/dungeon crawler titles I've tried out there."
35628478,"Thanks to the developer for providing this engrossing and enjoyable game. Suitable for all ages,  and a great RPG playground with some decent battling (even on the normal, non-hard mode). A very consistent quality game presentation in all facets -- graphics, gameplay, and discoverability. As a longtime business application developer, I fully appreciate the effort and skill evident in this game. Well worth the price. Looking forward to DLCs!"
35603116,"I've played much worse for more money, this game is definitely worth buying. Control wise, it's very smooth and fluid, and barring the times the controllers got lost (due to myself being in the way of the sensors), the mechanics and swordplay feel really well done. The tone of the game is well established, and although not quite to my personal taste, still well done.

My only major issue is that there's no way to turn around without physically turning your body, which caused the disconnection of the controllers. If our HMDs were wireless, this wouldn't be an issue, but due to the current limitations of being tethered to our computers, it's practically imparitive that we are able to use the controller to turn (via a joystic on the touch controllers, or on of the vive's trackpads). 

Something else I'd like to see is smooth locomotion as an option. I should be able to move out of the way of the enemy's attacks without having to teleport. I know teleportation is a major gameplay neccessity for those gamers who get motion sickness, but for those of us who don't, smooth locomotion give a much more immersive experience. 

There are other tweaks and improvements that could be made, for example the UI seems a little odd in my opinion, having to look down while in a fight to check your health. A suggestion i could make would be to layer a health/mana bar in the top left corner of the player's view so they could look at it when they need to, without losing focus on the enemy. This was done successfully with your score in RoboRecall, where you would look at the bottom corner to check your points, without actually moving your head. 

Although I definitely have suggestions, and there's only one major issue I can see, this game is definitely worth it's salt and the creators should be proud. I'll be keeping an eye on this title, it'll be good to see where swordfighting in VR goes."
35590121,"Шикарная игра (в рамках VR проектов).
Это первая достойная РПГ для вирт.реальности.
РПГ - скорее hack and shals (Diablo), нежели полноценная сюжетная (NWN та же, например).
Т.е. сюжета/диалогов и прочих ""ролевых"" составляющих - тут практически нет. 
Только боёвка.
Лут - собираем вручную. Буквально приходится карабкаться за ним в ""труднодоступные места"".
Врагов бьём вполне реалистично. Блокируем щитом атаки и пробиваем бреши в броне. 

Проходится часа за 3. Было бы больше - был бы только рад. 
Но и эти три часа были проведены в радость, за что разрабам большое спасибо.

Рекомендую к покупке ;)"
35579057,Great game. Controls work super well and the ability to turn your character by 90 degrees is super helpful. Had a lot of fun with it so far. I hope they keep adding more awsome stuff to this.
35573168,de loin le meilleur jeu en vr pour le moment mais tres court et pas de mode 'vagues d'ennemis' alors une fois quon a fait le tour le seul moyen de continuer a jouer est de recommencer une partie... par contre la mecanique des combats est tellement bien fait que je recommence non stop des parties juste pour me battre
35552492,"Years from now, when VR games are nearly indistinguishable from reality, 
this title will probably be regrded as one of the ultimate predecessors of the genre.
 
The Zork of VR.

UPDATE:  I am sad to say this was my favorite early vr game but it looks like its no longer supported.  The current game never had an ending.  You get a sweet sword, end of demo.  Add dlc I'd be happy to play more of this, but at this point its just an unfinished and unsupported game that they seem to no longer work on.  If support comes back I'll be happy to switch to a thumbs up again, this game has so much potential, sad to see it disappear into vapor ware demo territory."
35476643,"Excellent RPG , full control with touch on rift, you dont need loads of room to play can teleport everywere you need to want to go to. Fun game and fight mechanics cool."
35472551,This is a great start for the future of VR RPGs. It reminded me of playing Heretic or Hexen for the first time back when they were new.

35460222,I am enjoying Vanishing Realms. Its not too scrary no blood or gore. Great game. Thumbs up!
35445129,"This game is just awsome, must have if you own an Oculus or Vive... real gameplay and lot of sense of presence"
35413753,"Vanishing Realms - 4 out of 5 stars
Mood and atmosphere were great from the get go. localized torchlight was such a nice touch and the lighting of scenes throughout always impressed me, although dark areas could have been darker. Even without the torch there was only one place i struggled to see clearly. sounds and music added to the dungeon feel. Kudos to the designers.

Game play was very enjoyable with accurate aiming and pinpoint swordplay. you are not going to wildly swing your weapon and expect results. The peril level is fairly low with very few ""startling moments"" an no ""horror"" , making this adventure excellent for children. As an adult and veteran gamer I may have asked for more but that is not a criticism. 

There were some times that melee  felt a little lackluster. Here's why.....
Enemies were for the most part activated by proximity not line of sight. you could often stand quite close and just stare at them, so they lacked a ""threatening"" attitude. It was also easy to stay out of the areas of multiple enemies and engage them one at at time, and too easy to run away. Maybe slow the teleport dot even more than it already moves ( a good feature that is a clever way simulate player run speed)

Lastly, while there were elements of puzzle play most were easy (very easy) and the bosses posed only moderate challenge. I never ran out of health and had ample food to regenerate. There were lots of nooks to look into but few things to collect and (so far) not very many upgrades to shoot for. there wasn't ever i time that an object was out of reach and as far as i can tell  few reasons to revisit past areas. But this was my first go at it  and that was on default settings....and i did not get all achievements. 6 hrs total play time for about $25 is good value and i will play again for some things i am sure i missed.

Vanishing Realms is super fun for everyone. Hoping to see more and I will definitely buy new chapters
"
35401108,"Ok recently got a Rift and have spent a great deal on a multitude of games. I read some Steam reviews on this and they seemed very sure that this was a must try. Have to say that they were spot on.

I think that anyone who doesnt take something special away from this was never a young child.

It IS what VR promised. Hand down.There's a simple joy associated with every action. The bow and arrow, to my absolute delight, seems to be the same mechanic as The Lab. You know the feeling. Precise and fun. You really feel the feedback tension as you pull the arrow back. 

I almost never post reviews (apologies). But this seems to warrant the extra effort on my part.

My only mild gripe would be the click to run and click to turn issue. But its my no means a game breaker. I quickly adapted and proceeded to grin from ear to ear with every moment.

Thank you for such awesome."
35356326,"The first time I played this game after purchasing it, I didn't get very far into it because I didn't have time. 

I finally came back to work my way through it, and it's really quite something!

Pros:
+Visceral combat -- Strategy and shieldwork actually mean something 1v1
+Good archery
+Gorgeous Art Style and Graphics
+Great environments
+Moderate workout
+Eat 30 cheese wedges
+Link vs. vases syndrome

Cons:
-Palsy ""magic"" late game
-Lots of gold hoarding without much incentive to keep buying new weapons
-VR Beginner difficulty

Long story short, this is a really good VR RPG that can hold it's own weight, given enough time and care during development to carry through the flegling story it's working up to. I was genuinely disappointed when the game ended so abruptly, but it left me wanting more."
35314012,"I love the additions.  The climbing is fun and fresh.  It adds a new dimension to the game.  Trigger pick up is nice.  I don't care for the new movement stuff.  I like warping.  Maybe I'm just used to it but it's just confortable for me to warp.  Overall I love it.  I'm a huge fan.  You've got the best VR game out still.  I really look forward to the new chapters.  I do have suggestions though.  And this may not be what you want for your game but I think it would add so much to your next chapters.  More traps.  Maybe snakes in vases that give you 3 seconds to move or strike them and your posioned and die slow unless you rehealth up.  I like the health mechanism and feel it's not used enough.  Statue traps.  If you choose to grap an oddly placed gem on a huge statue it comes to life and strikes you.  Maybe you can't kill it.  You just need to get out of the room once you grab the gem or you're dead.  How bout since you've added climbing, a snake or monkey falls on the rope as your climbing across. If you don't slay it without cutting the rope you fall and die.  I realize these additions could make players move quickly and you may be trying to avoid that so if this is something of a concern then maybe only put these in the hard setting.  I've got tons of great ideas if you want more I only want to see more of what your doing so thank you.  Reilly"
35261456,"The Best VR RPG game out!  One of the very few VR games that allow you to explore the world.  I love the atmosphere, weapons (battle axe is a little off), inventory system, and the immersion.  I am greatly looking forward to the next Chapters being released."
35248091,"Vanishing Realms is a complex RPG with a character system where players can create their own characters and progress through the game world. The game is fun and well designed, with easy-to-learn controls and a variety of weapons and enemies. It’s a staff favorite and is quickly becoming a student favorite as well. We recommend this for more VR aware players and makes a good introduction to basic controls for new players. Go Tarheels! @House Undergraduate Library"
35234069,"Very good. The sword play is pretty good but easy so far. The bow is excellent, only the lab's bow felt better. This is a nice, lite adventure that is polished, compelling and satisfying. Did I mention you can smash pots/crates to collect loot? Let the hoarding begin!"
35216127,"This game is amazing. It is what I have always dreamed of. Zelda in VR.
It now supports free locomotion which made the game even better, much better in fact.
If u own a htc vive this is a must have in your collection."
35213151,"evry time i try to load the game it wont come thru the vr or load a menu just some crappy water on my pc screen and or a white room   all i want to do is at least try the game
"
35212159,"Not super far into the game yet but definitely far enough to get a really good feel for it. A must have game for VR, plenty great feeling combat and well designed (and importantly short) puzzles for a well paced and definitely fun adventure! It's the sort of game you can play in short burts thanks to the checkpoint system or hours at a time.

It's got just enough complexity to remain interesting yet simple enough for almost any gamer. The enemies are fun and despite it still being in early access it's well worth your time if you enjoy light hearted RPGs and/or adventure games :)"
35203913,"I'm pretty amazed this game is wirtten by a team of one. It was one of the most enjoyable VR experiences I have had so far. The way the sword fighting was implemented was very good; defend yourself, wait for your opening, then go for it. The recent addition of sliding movement was very welcome, though I wish the movement speed was a bit faster. Looking forward to the next chapters in the series!"
35195401,I really enjoyed this and would love a longer game with a grander story.
35191713,With the September 2017 update this game now works perfectly on Rift. And it is awesome.
35166667,"This game delivers the promise of VR.  For a mere $13.99 (current sale price) you get a game that pushed the boundaries of what one could expect in a VR title.  This is a complete VR experience.  Don't let the negative reviews or the status of EA or lack of constant updates stop you from getting this game.  This is a MUST buy VR title.  If you own a Vive, Oculus, whatever, you owe it to yourself to experience this game.

A lot of the negative reviews mention locomotion.  Well, you're not teleporting anymore unless you want to.  You can mostly move freely using your touch controller's joystick.  It's not perfect, you have to click down to go faster or to turn. But it's done very well. 

A lot of the other negative reviews mention lack of updates.  Well, this game is pretty much a finished product.  I have 1.7 hours on Steam currently and I still have not finished the game.  And there's a whole area I haven't explored.  Keep in mind that the normal price is $19.99.  This is a lot of content for the price.  And it's not just average content or above average content, this is AMAZING content for the price.  I played 1.7 hours straight because I was having so much fun.  I plan to get right back into the game later today.  That's because I loved the game world.  I have not experienced any bugs on the Oculus Rift w/ Touch.

The dungeons are so well designed and intuitive.  The puzzles are logical (no having to search for a  key that's hidden in some vase under a cabinet type crap).  The riddles are creative (yes, riddles).  You have different tools at your disposal, including food, pickaxe, torch, sword, shield, bow & arrow, or wand.  Also, climbing up the ropes or chains is just so much fun to get that extra bit of loot or spoiler alert [spoiler] burning curtains to get the items hidden beneath or breaking barrels with your sword to get more coins [/spoiler]

Admittedly, the weakest part of the game is probably the melee combat.  I didn't find it very challenging.  But I did enjoy using the bow and arrow.  And nothing is more satisfying that beating down that skeleton archer with a sword after he's been trying to pick you off.  

Rating 9/10 just a better story and improved melee combat and this game could have been legendary"
35148169,小朋友玩得很高興！
35145790,整体来说效果相当好，对战玩法很多，刀枪剑斧弓箭都很真实，整体模型做的也相当不错；美中不足的就是故事情节太短，很简单就通关了；希望在后期增加更多的关卡以及更多的游戏模式，如果增加联机，那这个游戏不可限量。
35143804,"This game reminds me of DnD advantures we used to play through with my uni friends. A bit simple and a bit naive but captivating nonetheless. Gameplay is based around dungeon crawling with some combat and an occasional puzzle thrown in for good measure. Movement is a combination of roomscale and artificial locomotion with a choice of teleportation and recently added free movement. I particularly enjoy the latter as it is implemented in a way that feels rather natural and is not VR sickness inducing in any way; there are even some advanced anti-sickness options for those who are succeptible. 

All in all it's not a very long game in it's current state, main adventure(chapter 1) is about 4 hours but it was very enjoyable to play and certainly worth the money. Especially so given further expansions are expected with new adventure chapter.

On the technical side, game was running ok on my initial oculus+touch setup but certainly became more comfortable with 3 sensors as there were some issues with dead tracking zones when facing certain directions. Latest patch added optional stick turning so having full 360 tracking is not as importalt now but still preferrable for a more immersive and smooth experience."
35134931,Much improved since the introduction of full free movement and smooth turning.  The movement system was all that was holding it back in my opinion and it's now a very good game.

Viel schöner kann man ein typisches Fantasy Hack&Slay aktuell in VR kaum machen!

34743271,"This game is a nice addition to anybody's VR library, but it is definitely not one of the best. Vanishing Realms is a very polished and overall it's a great game. This game is not as enjoyable if you have a smaller play space. My play space is about 2x1.5 Meters and the fact that I have to teleport a lot makes the game less realistic for me. I wouldn't suggest this as the first game to buy when you get a Vive or Oculus. I will definitely check it out if I have the money to spend and already tried most other popular VR games."
34719130,This was an amazing experience. I'm sure that as the mechanics of RPG games in VR gets more solidified the gameplay of Vanishing Realms will seem underwhelming but for right now it's one of the best out there. And a fair price too! Definitely check it out!
34716876,"I've wasted far too much cash on VR games that all just don't hold my interest. This one however did, it's a great little game, the best in my library and would happily play it again. Definitely my favourite VR game, alongside Elite Dangerous (which is in a whole different class really).
On a GTX970 - This runs smoothly, there's no vomit inducing jitter that I get on some of the other games. It's simple enough, but if you've always wanted to feel like you're crawlng around castle dungeons (with cartoon artwork) then you will just love this. Loads of fun."

34666165,"People complain about the length and content of this game, but even now most VR games are just demos. Vanishing realms  has a nice atmosphere, cool interactions with the world and what's most important a fighting system that has some weight to it. No one whom I let play it and experience VR didn't leave with it wihtout a smile on their face.
If you think that 20 bucks are too much for a game that can be finished in ~5 hours played in a chilled fashion then maybe wait for a sale. But you already paid 500 to 900 bucks on the equipment and maybe even more on a machine that can run it, so why should it hurt?"
34651527,"One of my favorite Vive games so far. I expected a low-budget, glorified tech demo (as many of the current class of VR games are), but was very pleasantly surprised by this. I really hope it continues to get improved and expanded upon - it has the potential to be really great."

Addicting. Even daughter aged 12 played it well. 
Does not allow stepwise climbing of steps or ladder, rather makes you jump a floor.
Make sure to burn all curtains or hay to keep discovering treasures. Keep the torchlight in the backpack.

Original review below
---

Initially it played pretty well but the teleporting just kills the immersion after 30mins. The game itself also seems glitchty and frustrating at times. 

The biggest downer is that there doesn't appear to have been any updates for many months, if I had known this before buying I probably wouldn't have got it as there's little hope of any new additions in the future.

Not worth the $23 I paid.

There should be a big red flag placed on early access titles that haven't been updated after a set time."
34464083,"This review is only valid IF the developers have infact abandoned this project and its backers. 

This game could have been a massive selling point for VR... thanks for being another developer to shit all over the individuals who backed you.  You ended up hurting the VR movement at the end of the day.  What little you did create was wonderful.  Really disappointing guys. The fact remains we had an agreement when I purchased this ""early access"" game.  You simply didn’t do what you said you would do  PERIOD.  

Please dont confuse my harsh words with anger...i'm simply bummed.  I was really excited to watch this beautiful project unfold and spread like wildfire.   What hurts the most is the lost potential. I pray Bethesda saves the VR day."
34422246,"This is what a VR RPG needs to be like. While short, it works out great. Motion does not cause sickness, combat seems solid. I would love to play more of this or games like this. 9/10."
34403356,"Absolutely loved this game. Multiple hours of gameplay, great story. Amazing fighting, you really feel like a hero by the end. The autopause and centering are very nice features as I get so into it I dont realize where I am."
34383469,"ABANDONWARE. DEAD GARBAGE.

Great game, but haven't seen an update in months. Last post from them was in April 2016 with an edit revision in march 2017, I don't know anything after that. Almost seems like they just flat out stopped. No posts, no patches, nothing. Dead."
34303348,"By far one, if not the greatest vr game i've played to date.
mechanics all seemed to work brilliantly. collissions were spot on. 
the menu system is funky and well placed, very easy to use.
the immersive feel it gave during play was second to none. within minutes i forgot i was in a game, crouching behind my sheild, swaying for dodges againist melee attacks. covering behind trees and rocks.a sense of breathlesnes as i began to breath heavier the more i sank into vr. a real sense of fantasy took over me almost like the days of zelda and elderscrolls combined, props to the devs!

ok cons: SPOILER....there isnt many
levels themselves are good length with plenty to do but theres not nearly enough content. no sooner had i lost myself in the world of vanshing realms id finished. ( ended with a big grunt of frustration ) taking my time i compleated within 2.4 hours
some enimies died a little to easy and id like to see a few problems to solve thrown in just to mix it up. ( a locked door puzzle of some sort would be nice)

and thats it. overall 100% gets my approval and i eagerly await more content.

34051110,"This is my absolute favorte VR game so far (and I have over 25).  This nailed the feeling of older Zelda games.  I loved exploring, the graphics are beautiful.  The atmoshphere is thick.  Get this one folks.  My only complaint is that a few of the upgrades feel unbalanced, but most are good and have their uses.  It still did not ruin a fantastic game, I just had to farm a bit more to get the rest of the stuff."
34025664,"Excellent game showing off what the VIVE system is capable of. Unfortunately, like all VR games, it doesn't offer any acutal content as you can beat the entire game in a few hours. I only click recommended because there isn't a inbetween option of ""meh"". It's great, but the lack of content or updates from the dev is concerning. Seems to be another quick money grab..."
34023979,"One of the best RPG games for HTC Vive, IMO! Had a blast walking through this one!"
34015831,"Hace dos días que compré las Oculus Rift y este ha sido uno de los primeros juegos que he jugado después de ver que el 100% de los usuarios lo recomendaba. Dudé un poco por dos cosas. Primero, el juego está en early access. Y segundo, solo da soporte a HTC Vive. Pero os puedo decir que el juego es perfectamente jugable. No he encontrado aún nigún motivo para el estado de early access, excepto un pequeñísimo parpadeo al teletransportarse. Segundo, el juego es completamente compatible con Oculus rift + oculus touch (con la configuracion experimental de 360 grados con dos sensores). Simplemente verás en tus manos los mandos de Vive al principio, aunque rápidamente serán una bola de luz con la que puedes hacer todo lo que haces con los mandos de htc vive. Así que si tienes oculus no tendrás problemas para jugar. 

Adicionalmente es recomendable un area de juego de al menos 2x2m pero no es obligatoria. Tienes un teletransportador que te permite jugar en un area un poco menor. 

El juego está en inglés sin subtítulos. Para mi no es un gran problema, aunque he visto que los acertijos te dan las pistas en un inglés con rimas que puede ser un poco dificil de entender para algunas personas. Aún así no hay mucho texto en el juego, así que no es que te vayas a pasar todo el día mirando el diccionario. 

En lo referente al juego en sí es bastante inmersivo, Me sorprendió mucho verme a mi mismo esquivando flechas, poniéndome en guardia frente a un enemigo. Intentando cubrirme con mi escudo... Esto es lo que se espera de un rpg para realidad virtual. Y sin duda, si alguna vez has deseado estar dentro de tu RPG favorito, esta es una buena ocasión para conseguirlo.  

Muy recomendable sin ninguna duda. Espero que saquen más juegos así, y que mejoren este aún más hasta que deje de ser un early access."
34000578,"This  game is by far my favorite VR game I have in my collection. I felt very immersed and rather surprised at the depth the enemies had when fighting. I had to learn the move sets of each enemy and know how to properly defend and attack. Looking for openings was the most fun because the enemies even adapted to my fighting style. They would cover and dodge almost as well as the player can. The layout of the dungeons were rather fun to explore. I often found myself wondering if I was going to stumble into a place I wasnt yet prepared for. The map design does a rather good job of encouraging exploration and discovering secrets. Finding all the hidden treasures was my favorite activity because hiding spots become so much harder when you actually have to duck behind things and look above into the rafters. I was throwing rocks before I bought a bow to knock items off of ledges. The things in this game are rather simple in comparison to a AAA RPG but experiencing them makes all the difference. These simple activities become very fun. Seeing a video does not do this game justice, it must be experienced in VR. The art style is also well done in my opinion and is pretty to look at while not making the enemies completely horrifying. While I thouroughly enjoyed this game and it is my favorite. I did feel it was lacking. I just want more, more to explore, more secrets to find, more to discover, more enemyu types, more locomotion options, other NPCs to interact with and buy from. It has a decent weapon selection and the inventory and player information system is by far the most natural and intuitive than any other game I have played. I just want more because it is so good. However considering, as far as I am aware, that this game is made by as single developer I am quite impressed with the game in its current state. I highly recomend getting it so that the developer can do more! It is fully playable in its current state and is a blast. This game is just a taste of the incredible future that VR has to offer. 9/10"
33989353,"i love it one of my fav games. i dont like teleport, but i deal with it, course the game is so goood. The bad thing is, when its over. Iam thinking about to play it again on harder. 

i have pay for this game (free on vive ). I read the new content that maybe come."
33971726,"This is easily one of my top fav games in VR right now. It's a fun cartoony dungeon exploration game. You roam around exploring the castle and fighting off enemies while avoiding traps and gaining new weapons. You could say it's similar to Zelda, but it is unfortunatly lacking in length. I think the first time I played through it took me around 3 or so hours. Fighting the skeleton knight for the first time was a great experience. If you've never played VR, you suddenly realize there's a seven-foot tall ""real"" monster in front of you, and you have no idea how to effectively use a sword and shield. In regular games, your character is pre-animated to swing a sword like a badass, and here I am flailing for my life and running into my bedroom walls out of fear. You'd be doing yourself a disservice to miss out on it. I just wish there was more."
33971283,The closest thing to Diablo in VR. Very fun. We need more VR games like this!
33881567,"I don't usually write game reviews, but this game really deserve one.
For me, Vanishing Realm shows what VR games should be. It is really immersive with its own style of graphics that makes you spend quite some time looking around you. The interaction with the environment is easy and I especially like the way the teleportation movement was implemented here. Most importantly, the fights were very enjoyable and I had to brace myself quite often to rush into the melee or duck behind a crate and shoot the buggers with my bow.

Now sure the game is still short (especially chapter 2) and it is true that additional content don’t comes out very often. But I still highly recommend this experience and I hope the dev will continue his works on what could be one of the best VR games out there.

33866618,"I'd give it 5 stars! So far, the best fantasy game I've played in VR (okay, the *best* game I've played). Graphics are well done and fairly realistic. You can collect items, swap weapons, drink potions. The sword play is realistic and I really have to work at it to get a hit. I can block shots but so can the orcs. The world is fairly extensive (could be bigger) but very imaginative. I feel like I was really there, dodging behind pillars to avoid arrows; fighting orcs hand to hand. What an adventure! This game really sold me on VR! Great work."

If you have a roomscale VR set, you need to play this. its a great ""first game"" for VR."
33711066,"Looking for a VR rpg game to play? Then Vanishing Realms is most likely the game for you! I have played this game for a few hours now and I love it, it has amazing graphics, cool weapons, and cool enviroments, This is an amazing game for the price! The only thing I think needs improvement is the combat system, I also do wish the game was longer than it is but I still believe it is one of the best VR games you can get for the price."
33644707,"I've got some fairly conflicting view on this game. While i dont feel that this is a particularly good game, it does let me do a few things i really want to do in VR (though not very well). Has some pretty entertaining melee fighting that encourages you to swing somewhat hard, though sub-par hit boxes bring the combat down. The bow is fun, though not nearly as fun as it was in The Lab. Two handed weapons interesting, but not exactly perfect to control. The puzzles use fun VR mechanics, which is all they really have going for them. Environments are pretty bland but does have a decent amount of interactability. All in all I really do enjoy playing Vanishing Realms, but im more looking forward to the next game that comes along and does it better."

I hope you will make this game multiplayer :-D"
33457766,"Fantastic dungeon crawler. As soon as I was dropped into the world of Vanishing Realms, I was blown away by the atmosphere. On many occasions throughout the game, I found myself just staring out at the scenery, feeling like I was really there. The memories I've generated through playing the game will likely stick with me forever since I always felt truly immersed. The game mechanics are well done, and I never really felt like there wasn't enough to do while playing. I probably would have more thoroughly enjoyed a longer game with some optional side quests, but I'm quite happy with the way this one turned out anyway, and I'm looking forward to a sequel. 10/10 best dungeon crawler for VR so far."
33450000,"please add trackpad locomotion, for some reason this games teleportation doesn't sit well with my stomach."
33444503,"I own an oculus and I was skeptical about how this game would function because it says its HTC Vive only. This game runs beautifuly on the Oculus. If you hesitated to buy this game because you have an oculus, don't. It's so good."
33422729,"One of the best VR RPGS I've played so far. 10/10 experience, simple yet smooth and fun. The bows, melee, sword and shield and movement are easy to get the hang of and once you get started, it's hard to stop. This is what VR is all about, well done."
33419031,"Beat it in 2 hours, but I think a missed a couple secrets.

Well worth the price of $14.00 on the Steam sale. I wish it didn't end. I liked the combat's simplicity, but where it really shines is all of the stuff you can interact with. My one and only death was dropping my torch onto hay and burning myself alive by accident. It was awesome.

I really like this game since you have a desire to search around to find gold or mana  so you can buy new stuff.

Chapter 1 is amazing really great dungeon crawl. Chapter 2 is basically a wave based game, which is still fun since at that point I had the best sword and the 2nd best sword so I was dual wielding swords flailing wildly as I destroyed the enemies.

The reviews aren't wrong. This is really a great game!"
33300268,First VR game to partially scratch the zelda itch
33282032,Its a great VR game but the game just stopped in development they just stopped updating it but its still a great game>
33279859,"This is the game that got me to buy VR. I've always wanted to dungeon crawl like this. Super atmospheric, lots of hidden treasure, decent combat.
I look forward to expansions or sequels."
33267347,"This is a great game for anyone interested in going through a virtual dungeon, fighting off enemies with swords and bows, finding treasures, etc. It's a very immersive experience. Well worth the money!

Just be careful not to knock down anything in your room -- you will find yourself moving around the room quite a bit once you get used to dodging in combat and firing off your bow from behind a corner!"
33250177,"Playing this feels like stepping into the future. THIS is why VR exists.
It is so incredibly hard to put words to it, but let me say this: as a kid, didn't you dream, fantasise about how it would be if you were actually walking through the dungeons from that game you were playing? Actually having to fight the undead, with your sword, shield, bow and magic staff? I know I did. Now I have my answer. And it is so amazingly, stupendously cool!
Thank you devs, for making this, thank you!"
33248478,"This is the best VR game I have tried so far. Unlike many other VR games, this one has real gameplay mechanics story narrative. It is not a sandbox type game, but rather a game with deliberate level design. There are secrets and different ways to approach combat. Overall a fun game with a true gameplay experience.

I had some minor issues with flickering when teleporting, but no other issues.

The game lasted me a little over 2 hours. I hope there will be UI improvements and more content added soon. But it is worth playing even though its an early access game."
33242319,"Wow...! Che esperienza!!! Il combattimento melee è qualcosa di spettacolare, faticoso e tattico sa lasciarti col fiato corto e metterti tensione!
Titolo da avere assolutamente in libreria!"
33229004,"Just completed this game on an Oculus Rift 360 setup with 4 sensors. Had no tracking issues whatsover and ran absolutely fine, other than a slight almost imperceptable flicker when teleporting. I doubt I would of even have noticed it if I hadn't read posts from others moaning about it. It didn't bother me at all but maybe they had worse issues.

Really great game and one of the best VR experiences I have had so far. Dungeon crawlers seems to be perfectly suited to VR. Would love to see more acts and some more movement options would not go a miss. I can live with teleport but I find it pretty immersion breaking and would prefer dash or even better free locomotion (Not everyone gets VR sick)."
33228534,"The first chapter of this game is very fun. With most objects you see interacting in the way you expect, it has the fantasy exploration feel I was hoping for in VR. The Second chapter is basically just a bunch of repetitive fights, showing that exploration is quite a large part of what makes the introduction to the game so interesting."
33168970,"Just ended my first 2 hours of this, my second VR game, and the experience was so incredible that I have to wonder if I can ever be impressed with a non-vr game again. The feeling of immersion, of presence, and danger were a completely new experience. I didn't feel this playing Star Trek Bridge Crew, either, so not all VR games have the magic. You block with a shield and wield a sword, and it feels natural, like your own limbs. I think about all the big-name games defining the cornerstones of gaming through the decades, and they now seem like jokes compared to this.

I just read pcgamer's recommendations on the steam summer sale, and passed up 3 non-vr games I would have gotten just last week. All I want is VR adventure, after playing this.

Edit: Came back after hundreds of hours of dozens of other VR games to try the locomotion update to this game. Made it even better. Immersion still incredible in this game. Still one of the best. After this and Dead Effect 2 VR, I'm done with flat gaming."
33154743,"Honestly, feels like the first actual game on VR. While everything else that comes out for VR these days seems like a shallow arcade game, Vanishing Realms stands out as something with actual substance; a game you would actually buy for your pc and try to beat. Beautiful immersive world (WoW-style graphics), smooth gameplay, interesting mechanics. A must-have."

The atmosphere is excellent. I found myself ducking behing pillars and other objects to avoid attacks and really felt engrossed in the environment. When you battle your first monster, you will be extremely excited. It's fun all the way through. At the game's last scene, I put my arms out in victory and just took in the scenery.

Just a hint, if you are throwing items up in the air, which you might want to do from time to time, use an underhand throw or just flick it overhand. I hit my ceiling with the controller a few times before I learned that!

Overall, I loved this game and I'm eagerly waiting for more content."
33048564,"Only real dungeon crawler so far, and although its pretty taxing on graphics, its well worth it. It plays very well. Escpecially if you played Longbow in the Lab. Just make sure you have room, you'll need it."
32977867,Great VR experience.
32966751,Awesome fun.
32818854,"I'm writing this here because I don't really know where to go add it (Steam is seriously terribly designed):

This game, despite not officialy supporting the Rift, still works well with it for the most part and is a lot of fun. If you have a Vive with full room-scale it must be brilliant. So, I'd highly recommend it.

But, it would be great to see you add some proper/official Oculus Rift support. Maybe you could even release it on the actual Oculus Store and offer people who've bought it for SteamVR a key to download it to Oculus Home at no additional cost.

But, great start to a potentially stand out VR games--just bring it to Rift properly, in one way or another."
32770557,Please add trackpad locomotion. I have feeling that it would be great in this game (it requires to optimize timing slightly in several traps and may be add jump animation in several places and that's all. It's not a problem to even have different timings for different types of locomotions in single player game if necessary).

32745714,"Im a year late playing this game and its one of the best VR games I have played. Enthralling game. A 50 hour version of this would be a dream come true.

Update: While this game blew me away upon first playing, Im sad to say that it seems abandoned. Most other games have atleast SOME dev support. This one has had no updates for damn near a year. Great demo of VR's potential but I cant recommend this at 20$. Its a 3 hour experience at most. Hell, I dont even know if the developer is still alive. Will update this review accordingly if it ever gets an update, but for now, catch it on sale."
32744589,"I've revised my review after playing more.  It is annoying that there is no obvious way to quit other than going to the controller menu and exiting the game, but other than that, the game is quite well done.  I think this sets a standard for what future games should be like.  This game really has a lot of potential."

32583287,"I really had a hard time quitting this game. It was like a good book that I read in one sitting then got mad at myself afterward because I didn't savour it enough. I have played through on standard and can already tell that I will be back in it to complete all the achievements and light all the candles.

The one thing that I will note is that when I teleport there is a shutter of the previous frame or some other frame, it takes some getting used to but if that were addressed it would be perfect.

I can't wait for more content I would play 12 hours of this game!"
32571698,"One of the first high-quality games for the Vive, and thanks to continual developement, still one of the best. There has been a lot of abuse of the early access system, but this developer has lived up to their promises. They're still working on it, but it is already a well-polished game."
32565658,"Eines der besten Spiele das ich auf der Vive gespielt habe. Besonders zu empfehlen da das Spiel sehr viel Wert auf die speziellen Anforderungen in VR legt: z.B.: Gerät man während eines Kampfes ausser halb des Spielebereichs schaltet das Game automatisch auf Pause. So kann gemütlich neu positioniert werden ohne das sich inGame etwas ändert. Ebenso wenn man in Wände läuft oder über eine Kante, korrigiert das Spiel die Anzeige nach. 
Das Spiel fängt ganz simple an mit umherlaufen (teleportieren), sammeln von Gegenstände und lösen von Rätseln. Dann kann man sich ein Schwert kaufen und damit auch Skelette vermöbeln. Später gibts dann noch Schild, Hammer (für Erz Abbau), Zweihandaxt, Pfeilbogen und Zauberstab dazu. 
Alles in allem ein cooles Spiel für eine tolle VR-Erfahrung."
32549307,"This game is amazing, the only issue I have is the developer kinda vanished (hee hee) and has not relesased any more information about chapeter 3 since september 2016. It sucks no knowing if there even will be a chapter 3. But for 20 bucks, every vr plater should own this game beacuse it shows what vr can be all about. you get around 4 hours of playing time and if you take your time and milk it you can get long times.

Although the enemies are a little 'cartoony' it still gets me swerating, as its the best melee style game I have found. Its is the game I keep coming back to on my own to play rather than the titles that are to impress friends or introduce them to VR.
I hasve now played for about 5 hours and its still developing, love the variation of weapons and the puzzle element. Its pretty easy, which some people may find a negative, but I actually find a postitive as so many games, Arizona Sunshine for one has sections that are so hard that I have to do them over and over. I haven't got ther patience for all that.
Great dungeon crawling, skeleton smashing fun."
32505743,One of the only VR games with a story worth playing
32495552,"Simply put, this game is what sold me on VR.

Like most, I was extremely skeptical about the very young, very ""gimmicky"" HTC Vive.

Until my cousin slapped a Vive over my eyes, and put me inside Vanishing Realms - 

- where I was immediately transported to an enormous dungeon of old, wielding but a simple torch as I walked through the first doorway, only to be greeted by a dark, looming evil voice that seemingly came from the walls themselves.

Here, you will explore ancient dungeons, collect coins to buy weapons and items that will decide whether or not you live or die, actually physically crawl through trap rooms just to get to the next hallway, fight skeletons that are bigger than you ever could've imagined, and this is all just in the first 20 minutes of gameplay. 

Here, you will truly get lost in an unreal atmospheric dungeon crawling experience. You will never forget it as long as you live, I guarantee that. There is simply nothing like this game. It's absolutely amazing. It's an essential VR experience for everyone who has VR, and everyone who is skeptical or even just trying VR for the first time. Do not wait. Buy this immediately.

32314310,"I want more!

Can't wait to see added content.  This game is like 'VR for MMO enthusiasts"".  And being an MMO enthusiast, I really really loved it!

The melee fighting is well done, the bow is adequete for a multi-weapon game like this, the tool belt works perfectly.  The AI won't run up on you but they are also smart enough to not let you mow them down with a bow without trying to dodge or put a shield up.

The story never gripped me, but that's not what I'm playing this for anyway.

The fantasy adventure was amazing.  I love goign through dungeons holding a torch and swapping to a sword and shield when a skeleton approaches and then ducking behind walls and firing out arrows in room scale.

This game delivers on all fronts and is just a must have for any fantasy enthusiast or MMO player.  Runs fine at 1.5x SS except a couple dropped frame in the outside environments which isn't anythign more than a mild occassional nuisance.

Oh, and you can interact with most everything in this game which is why we play VR.. bravo and well done, devs!"
32309754,Absolutely superb. Best game I've played on the Vive to date (and I've played a lot). Finished it a few months ago though and waiting for next chapters to become available!! Hurry up! ;)
32287264,"Basically VR Zelda.
Smash skellingtons. Find treasure. Solve puzzles.
Lots of fun where time seems to disappear whilst you're playing it."
32213093,I love playing this game and it feels very immersive. The only downside is the lack of content. I wish they had not stopped development.
32189471,No game has ever moved me enough to write a review.  Well done Kelly Bailey.  I would have bought a vive just to play this game.  (if it ever became procedurally generated I would most likely never play a different game again.)
32185864,Still such an amazing game very little compares sadly
32179082,"Great immersive experience. Once you get a few weapons, the fun really starts. Great workout too, swinging the sword and shield around!"
32171544,"Room scale VR done right.
Nice stylized graphics, every general fantasy weapon in game, OK combat system, minimal puzzles.
Fun for a couple of hours!"
32164593,"This is far and away the best fantasy adventure game available for the Vive. It's also one of the best games in general. This is exactly the type of game I was hoping for when I bought my VR rig- and I can't wait for the next installment! It even has enough content for a couple of playthroughs- you won't find everything the first time. It's fun, inuitive, has great visuals, and is overall much more polished than anything similar that I've seen. If you've ever wanted to be Link, or play VR D&D, this is it."
32154674,"Awesome dungeon crawl in VR!  A bit short but overall I had a fantastic time!  Also, I think that it essentially functions as a proof of concept for future VR adventure games."
32137805,Genuinely the best VR title to date on any VR platform. I haven't experinced that feeling of wonder an immersion since I first played Ultima Underworld back in 1992.
32107970,A must have for any VR owner. Highly recommend.
32092430,Must have for any VR user. 5/7 would Harambe again
32062594,"This is what I always dreamed of when I first head of VR games over 25 years ago. 

Now that time has come.

The inventory system is perfect and I hope that other games consider implementing a similar system.

(Arrizona Sunshine, has a similar system, but Vanishing Realms is far superior with being able to acutally see what you have and move things around.)

Can't wait for more content!  But I'll be replaying the current levels!"
32053701,"So far the best VR RPG mechanics and gameplay yet.  This game is tons of fun, just wish it was longer.  I'm looking forward to the next episode."
32048389,"This is a great game which really shows off Vive. Unfortunately it is always crashing on my machine which I custom built for VR. It would be great if there were some way of determining what causes the crash or at least have more frequent saving as most of the 5 hours I have played this game for has been redoing bits I've already played. (I've already uninstalled, reinstalled and done all of the steps outlined in support such as setting the priority and turning off anti-virus software)."
32007949,"The best VR dungeon crawler currently available.  Everything works well and combat is very satisfying.  All of the groundwork is there for this to turn into a killer VR app.  With three trackers, works flawlessly with the Oculus Rift and roomscale tracking."
32007784,"you should have this game, its great"
32006357,"I enjoyed this game a lot. Playing through chapter 1 is a like being Link in a Zelda game. It is a really immersive experience. Chapter 2 felt so much cheaper than though. You go through chapter 1 collecting all these items and gear, and then go into chapter 2 expecting to have some cool stuff to do with your gear, but instead are met with repetitive arena battles that are not very difficult at all. Despite that, I would still say for 20$ it is definitely worth it pick this game up."
31995267,"the best roleplaying game for VR so far
good feeling,  good rp game  not the best looking game,  graphic wise ,but ok for vr

31988411,"GOLD! CHALICES! MORE GOLD! SWORD FIGHTING!

Quite possible the best VR game I've played. Super fun."

31974453,A very complete VR game with a full campain. The controls are good and the gameplay is fun. The art style is looks great. Highly recommend this game to anyone with VR
31973369,This is everything I wanted to see in an RPG VR Game !
31963639,"This is the best sword game ive played with my Vive so far!

The sword/shield is so much fun and easily my favorite but the bow mechanics work flawless too! The magic is nice but if im being honest leaves a little to be desired. As far as the 2-handed weapon, wow I need a lot more time to get used that but it seems like fun!

I love the inventory system, and really appreciate how much the currency and mana was actually useful to spend my time searching and finding. Which reminds me, I love just running around the levels searching for hidden gold, especially because theres so much hidden!

My favorite VR game so far! I am super excited for more content! Meanwhile I am going to try at my Hardcore run now!"
31957768,"Das beste und atmosphärischste VR Spiel, dass ich bis jetzt spielen durfte. Eines der gaanz wenigen Spiele die ich trotz ""nicht deutsch"" jederzeit wieder gekauft hätte. Doch auch wenn ich dieses Erlebnis um nichts in der Welt missen möchte, ist es einfach viel zu kurz! In 1-2 Stunden ist es durch gezoggt und dafür finde ich 20 Euro deutlich zu viel. Im moment kann das Spiel noch damit punkten, ganz allein auf weiter Flur zu sein, doch sobald da Konkurenz kommen sollte mit ähnlichem Flair aber mehr Kontant für´s Geld, sieht es dunkel aus."
31954266,This game should be renamed to 'Vanishing Devs'.
31944818,一开始不知道怎么玩，后来仔细解密之后一发不可收拾，精品，绝对值得购买！！！
31935493,Genuinely brilliant.
31912522,Ive been playing a bunch of vr games since i got my vr headset and honest i thought i had played some amazing games but this game beats all of them by far! You get so much content for your buck its not super short like lots of other vr games and its not just wave based like the rest of the vr games either... Swordfighting in this game is like fighting in real life you have to block and look for openings in the enemies defence its amazing! theirs easily 4-5 hours in this game and its a early access game! If you have a VR headset you have to play this game its 100% worth the buy!!! I'll be eagerly waiting for chapter 3!
31889026,"I consider Vanshing Realms to be the standard for VR sword and sorcery like games. You get to use sword, shield, bow, and a little magic while dungeoneering through a short yet entertaining dungeon and arena finale. The game is short, but definitely one of the best VR games currently available."
31865166,Truely a fun adventure game. Really looking forward to the next chapter.
31864327,macht echt spass nur zu kurz ;)
31846327,"Very awesome. It's nice to see a VR game with an actual story and progression, and a game which doesn't involve zombies ;-) you can tell the developers put in a good amount of time to make this game. Keep up the great work! The sword fighting is fun, also."
31821658,"Wow, I was not sure about getting this but I am very glad I did!
FUN! FUN!
Great environments, enemies, fighting, weapons...Its all good."
31812281,"Amazing game! One of the best (if not THE best) VR games I have played on Vive. Worth every penny (even if kind of short), but the developer is promising more chapters.  Good work on this game!"
31811698,최고의 VR게임입니다. 강추합니다.
31791036,"Mega geiles Spiel super Atmosphere mega geile Technicken und mega geile Kämpfe.
Ich empfehle diese Spiel sehr."
31782441,"This game is superb.

Not a deep game as of yet, but this is one of my best purchases ever for VR.  I am replaying this in Hardcore at the time of this.  Yes it is short, but amazing and I really hope this fleshes out more.   I really love the inventory system, and the polish for being Early Access.  As is, it is worth a buy.  Its just plain fun!

Go for it. I spent more than this on dinner with the family once, easily."
31771577,Muito bom o mais próximo   de um adv rpg até agora.
31741274,"Pros

- Seems like there's a decent amount of content for a VR game.

Cons

- Teleportation
- Cute art style, which decreases realism for me. I think I'm mentally comparing it to skyrim, or what I want skyrim to be in VR, and getting disappointed.
- Not a lot of content compared with regular RPGs - 2 hours - as a VR community, we need to encourage exploration of VR but at the same time discourage marketing of games that have very little depth, which gives VR a bad rap."
31728757,Only get though if you have a lot of money to pay for all the chapters which they will be releasing paid over the development.
31725282,A must have VR game if you like Zelda games.  I cannot wait for more content!
31697180,"I was really suprised playing this game made me glad I bought a Vive and soo looking forward to more games like this.
The game has  so many good things about it like a classic Zelda  feel but new and fresh in VR it's well worh the 20.00 and really this is not a short game for playing in a vr world.
Also 2 skill level modes and hard is pretty tough the bad guys fight better.
Again i'm suprised how much I enjoyed this game reminds me of the first time I played Zelda.
 I only wish I had a DVD and nice case to go with it, to bad.
Not enough quality games out there but makes me appreciate this even more."
31663436,"Bien que ce jeu puisse être un peu cher pour certain, je trouve qu'il vaut largement son prix. A la façon d'un zelda, la progression dans le donjon ainsi que le fais de débloquer de nouvelles armes au fur et à mesure de l'avanture en font un très bon jeu, et le VR rajoute une en plus une imersion totale dans cet univers. La durée de partie étant de 3h environ pour ma part (et n'ayant pas tout exploré à fond), un bon point pour ce jeu est aussi sa longueur, pas mal pour une aventure en VR.
En somme, je recomande fortement ce jeu aux amoureux de Zelda, mais aussi aux personnes en générale voulant avoir une bonne expérience VR."
31644410,"Game is great, Can't wait for new chapters."
31633676,"отличная игра! интересные бои! с луком или мечем! графика супер! музыка и атмосфера класс! однозначно рекомендую! по началу может показаться немного скучноватой, но потом когда начнутся бои все станет на свои места!"
31583794,"Short. I beat it in four, one-hour sessions.

Gonna play again and again because THIS is what VR is for. THIS is why I bought the HTC Vive.

This game right here is why you spent the money on room scale VR instead of settling for Cardboard.

If/when they figure out multiplayer with user submitted maps, this type of game will be the 'killer app' for VR.

More please."
31582510,"몹들의 인공지능이 너무 낮은것만 난이도 별로 보강한다면 굉장한 발전가능성이 있는 게임입니다.

31534189,Still one of the best VR games to date.  The level of polish in this game is staggering.  The combat is perfect.  If you own a Vive you absolutely must get this...
31520185,"I litterally feel I have been waiting for this game all of my life... SO SO much fun, its worth buying a vive just for it... Great controls, combat feels very realistic, dodging, parrying etc and good enemies... keep it up guys!"
31515290,This could be a great game if I could play for 25 minutes straight without it crashing. It's really a shame because I love to play this game and still would recommend this to anyone.
31514265,Very good experience for VR! You can't get wrong for 20 bucks :)
31494630,"Contrairement à pas mal de jeux VR qui se terminent vite, en laissant un sentiment de faim, Vanishing Realms est plus long (je l'ai fait en 4-5 heures en cherchant les énigmes, et en me perdant un peu). Avoir un blouclier et une épée rend vachement bien, les décors genre cartoon sont bien faits, l'ambiance est très agréable et le combat dynamique et plutot précis.  Quelques pieges à la Tomb Raider, parfois mêmes sournois si vous avez perdu votre torche. 

Conseil: le tir à l'arc est beaucoup plus efficace que le lancer d'objet pour faire tomber les coupelles.

Pour l'instant, avec The Lab, une expérience incontournable."
31476915,I probably spent thirty minutes doing nothing but set things on fire with the torch.
31471490,"A short (around 2 hours to complete chapters 1 and 2), but cool example of a roomscale RPG with teleportation movement. In the first chapter: kill mobs, collect loot, find the treasure, buy stuff and move to next dungeon.  For the second chapter: fight in successivly more difficult arenas, killing off the bad guys before the timer runs out."
31450895,What can I say?  There really isn't anything else like it for VR yet.  I love figuring out ways to avoid the traps and outsmart the enemies.  I will back myself up to one of my walls in game and then move where I want to start giving myself plenty of room for fighting/dodging.  Playing tag with bows and arrows with enemies can be a lot of fun.  The few times I've ran into an unexpected enemy have gotten my heart pumping trying to quickly get out my weapons.  If your new to VR and/or looking for an actual RPG game give this a try.  You won't be disappointed.  My only regret is that I don't have time to play it more consistently.

31342121,"Absolutly amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
Once i bought it, I couldn`t put the VR headset down. 
Its a refreshing new take for vr games from the usual FPS shooter I usually play. 
I would reccomend this as the first game anyone buys to try their brand new htv vive..

Cant wait for more levels to come and with luck online co-op."
31328589,One of the few best Vive games right now. Definately a must have.

Update: 9/13/17

Developer has abandoned this title, as such don't waste your money here.......such a shame.

Update: 9/21/17

After over a year the developer finally posted an 'update' of about 500MB in size which includes oculus control support but no addition to the game itself......Proceed with caution on this game. It's just a demo as it is now, and the content does not warrant the price. A year ago, when VR content was sparse this game was interesting and did a lot to show the potential of VR, now it's just a money grab. Wait until the developer actually completes the game or it's at least 50% off sale."
31206054,I checked for VR games for months now but it is still the best experience which gives me the feel im in the game. I really hope for more contents like this for VR.
31202422,"Ottimo gioco di esplorazione in salsa Fantasty, c'è anche un piccolo accenno alla raccolta risorse e al crafting.
Hanno aggiunto anche il sistema di movimento con la classica camminata"
31200615,"Vanishing Realms ""Rite of Steel"" gehört derzeit zu den größeren VR Spielen und hat mir insgesamt drei Stunden Spiel, Spaß und Spannung gebracht. Ich kann es klar empfehlen.

Als Glücksritter zieht es Euch auf eine Insel. Unter der Annahme man sei hier allein, erkundet ihr alte Gemäuer, dreckige Gassen aber auch wunderschöne Orte (die ich aus Spoiler gründen nicht genauer beschreiben möchte)
Zunächst mit einer Fackel bewaffnet wird schnell klar, dass man doch nicht ganz so allein ist und sich schnell Waffen (Schwert, Schild, Axt, Bogen etc) organisiert. Ihr kämpft teilweise ""Mann gegen Mann"" gegen diverse Feinde, müsst Angriffe blocken oder in Deckung gehen, um Pfeilen auszuweichen. Sollte man alle Prüfungen meistern, so wartet am Ende der langersehnte Schatz.

Die Grafik ist angemessen und meines erachtenes ziemlich beeindruckend und hält einige wunderschöne aber düstere Orte und Gegner bereit. Ab und zu hatte ich Probleme mit meinem Spielradius sodass, dass Spiel sofort in die Pause ging, wenn man übertrat. Diese Funktion scheint sinnvoll zu sein, hat mich aber jedesmal aus dem Spiel geholt, bis ich herausgefunden habe, dass man das auch abschalten kann.

Alles in allem ein echt geniales Spiel und ein Pflichtspiel für VR Brillen. Es bisher eines besten Spiele, die ich mit meiner Vive gespielt habe."
31189771,"Pros :
- Was one step ahead of the competition, when I purchased it back in April 2017.
- Is now 2 steps ahead of the competition, since it's September 2017 patch.
- Definitely the best VR game of it's genre (single player RPG) on Steam.
- Possibly the best VR game available on Steam, and at least mine.

Cons : ~6h to finish the game on easy level (that was before the September 2017 patch, so maybe more now). That's plenty enough, but it will still leave you wanting for more (a DLC is coming), as even the closest VR RPG competition continues to lag behind (in content, quality and polish)."
31147060,"Looks fantastic.  Fun to play.  Glad I bought this one, well worth the 20 bucks I paid."
31129809,Great VR RPG. The precise controls and great UI made the game even better.

31073380,"I can say this is the sword art offline
Great environment and graphics. 
Also a nice combat system, a must have for vr owners."
31060984,"Wish this game was a little longer than 2.5 hours. Really well done VR game though. Graphics and action are spot on. I like the fighting system. And the inventory system is spot on for VR gaming. Well done over all. Get this game for VR, well worth it."
31054692,Been a while since I played; absolutely blown away by the the improvements.
31051828,So good

31009287,"Oh my god. This game is awesome! I can't believe I put off acquiring it for so long! And I can't believe I still think it's awesome now, when it came out way back when Vive was brand new and the bar for content was so low.

This is really excellent. I just spent 90 minutes in it for what was supposed to be a quick look around and just...couldn't leave.

Ok. Criticism. The swordplay feels a bit arcade-like. And it's got the same problem that sword fighting games always have in VR. And I think I have some advice, that I've been handing out to every developer I've found who's working on this kind of thing.

Change your swordfighting mechanic so that it's like when you draw the sword you go into an altered state.

Obviously, this means slow motion. Which is how we all instinctively did sword fighting when we were kids. Because you aren't going to have serious swordplay at real sword-swinging speeds and be able to actually intercept stabs and slashes in a realistic way. Not at speed. Which leaves us with this really imprecise version of swordfighting that's been dumbed down. But that takes the joy out of the swordfight itself! I mean, it's still cool because you're in a mystic cave and you're fighting a skeleton and so on, but the swordfighting part gets old fast because of everything I just described.

So slow it down. Make the swordfight work on a flexible timescale very much like the basic mechanic in SuperHot. When you pick up your sword, everything should slow down to timescale slaved to how fast you move. And if you try to stab your sword through their shield or armor or a wall (i.e., you don't stop swinging when it hits a barrier and you see sparks fly and the controller buzzes in your hand or whatever), you drop your sword and have to duck down and scoop it up (which isn't life threatening in slow-motion...but it's a setback and you probably won't do it too many times in a row).

Then you can make the hitpoints go way, way up in both directions - a hard slash across the belly should be fatal (for the player or the NPC's). Smooth out and polish the animations a bit so they pass muster in slow motion. That especially goes for the animations when you kill them. Maybe work in some halfway-there maiming scripting - if you cut off an arm or leg, they're pretty much done for, but not before they make one or two last clumsy attempts to kill you with their remaining limbs. Do that, and players will actually get really excited about any opportunity for melee combat."
31008522,"A proper VR full-body experience. Sword-fighting, shields, archery, duck/dodge. Fantastic quality, one of those games I use to introduce newcomers to the fold - always a dropped jaw. Once they're confident, I show them Robo Recall; Vanishing Realms is on that level. 

Like most current VR titles, very short. I played once-through in 1h. Speed-ran the second pass in 10-20m. I like the game enough I just dilly-dally in the world, though I've exhausted it. I hope they release more content soon!

[Update] the DLC is epic. Larger than base game, completely new items / mobs / mechanics. The last boss area was legitimately intimidating. So gorgeous with graphics overhaul and in Index!"
31008335,"I was skeptical about getting a game that only has 2 levels and having seen most people beat it in 4 hours.
I've only played an hour so far, and I feel I've already gotten my money worth out of this experience.  I have over 20 games, and a lot of the popular titles.  This is by far my favourite VR experience so far.

A floating inventory system is a great idea.

A fully interactive 3D environment with destructable and tossable tiems, is very well done, and hides treasure in all sorts of places forcing you to look into barrels, under tables, and smash all the things.

The first sword-and-shield melee combat system I've seen that works, and the AI fights in real-time.  Noticed very little errors, tracks, blocks, and hits really well.  

Great game, well worth.  Looking forward to playing more, finishing it, and playing it all over again lol."
31007882,Loved it!
31006381,"Quand je pense que c'est ce jeu qui m'a poussé à franchir le pas pour l'acquisition du HTC VIVE. j'en suis ravi mais un peu frustré par les consignes du jeu dans la langue de Shakespeare :( Sinon, toujours pas de suite....au bout d'un an!

30990014,"Amazing game.
It makes you want to just go till the end non stop.  
I'm so glad I bought it and i hope MANY more come out like it."
30988821,"This is a gorgeous game and the exploration is super fun and engaging. The puzzles are pretty fun too.

What kept me from really engjoying it was the combat. It felt very clunky and repetetive. Disabling all hit detection on your weapon after landing a hit doesn't feel like a very good way of handling whatever issues it is trying to prevent (I am guessing kills from just holding your sword inside an enemy). It forces a repetitive ""strike, parry, strike, parry"" experience that is not very engaging and feels like it is forcing me to play the way the game wants to. Most of the damage I took was from striking and then brining my sword back around for a parry but the blade wasn't turned back on and the enemy just hit me anyway.

I know we are still in the early stages of these kinds of games but it is important to know what works and what doesn't. In my opinion, it does not in this case."
30968776,"[h1] A Promising VR Action Adventure RPG[/h1]

This took me much longer to get through than I thought it would, and that's a pleasant surprise. Vanishing Realms is very easy to lose yourself in, and I mean that in a good way. There are some sprawling areas of the world here, though it sometimes feels sparsely populated. You have your melee guys, your ranged folks, your magic fellows, your mini boss types, but they're the only inhabitants of this world. I would have liked to see some wildlife, even if it wasn't interactable (like a scripted scene where something runs out ahead of you) just to give you a sense that there was a living, breathing world here. Maybe there isn't though, and that's the point of the game!

[spoiler] After you complete the first part of the game (the main boss fight), the second part feels... quick, rushed together and more like a wave game than anything else. [/spoiler]

Sure, it's early days and lacks the sophistication we've come to expect from AAA commercial games now, but none of that matters when you're on your quest and immersed into the VR world of Vanishing Realms.

Worth every cent (and more), I can't wait for more games like this and more from this team."
30949113,"The first chapter of this game is probably my favorite VR experience so far. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete, and that was with some backtracking for secrets and such. The second chapter is much shorter and while fun, was a bit unsatisfying in the end. Some points of concern I want to mention:

1. You have to buy every equippable with money, with maybe one or two exceptions. Working through a puzzle or fighting through a lot of enemies and getting to the next item but not having enough money to buy it is a pretty bad feeling.

2. The first sword you can buy at the cheapest is fine, I used it all the way through the first chapter. If you want a different one you have to go all the way back and get another, which is long and tedious. They should be spaced out through the level to let you upgrade. Dual-wielding feels pretty awesome and works well too.

3. Don't buy the axe... Just don't. Save your gold. Super unsatisfying damage with some wonky controls. The top tier sword costs less and does more damage. Winding up and swinging it only to have it do no damage off a shield or helmet needs to be fixed. Armor penetration anyone?

30934992,"What an amazing game! It is short, but the immersion you feel is fantastic. I ended up forgetting I was in VR during a boss fight and broke a chunk of my shelf off with the controller. I had to tear apart the controller to fix it because it stopped tracking.That's how immersive this game is! The fighting feels great, the storyline is top notch, and the amount of substance to the game is excellent for the price. One of the best games I've played yet!"
30933436,"Fun and fantastic. Like all things, some polishing is in order, but 9/10 otherwise. Can't wait fo the next chapter."
30930495,"An outstanding VR experience, the graphics style makes the game both endearing and able to run on less-powerful hardware, the combat is fun but sometimes janky and/or a little strange in its behavior, but never enough to cause any real problems.  The enemies and enviornment are very impressive in VR as well.  

I would definitely recommend this game as long as you have the room for it.  This game does require a fairly large playable place, and hitting your walls/desk/other obstructions while playing was an issue for me occasionally with a slightly smaller than recommended room size (about 1.8m by 2m)."
30928381,Dont buy until they upate this game more. It has been stuck in Early Access for a while. The controles are great. No motions sicknes. Its just not worth buying a tech demo for $20 at this point in time.
30912632,In the top 3 best VR games I have played.  What VR is supposed to be.

Great use of physics and combat mechanics

30773908,"Невероятно кругая РПГ-шка для Vive. На данный момент является одним из лучших доступных VR проектов.
Затягивает с первых секунд игры. Полное погружение за счет возможности взаимодействия со всем окружением. Завезли и линейный сюжет, и побочки в стиле фарма голды, поисков тайников, получения ачивок и просто исследования огромного открытого мира. Приятно реализованный инвентарь для всевозможных полезностей.
Радует, что голда собирается не просто так, а для получения более мощного лута - фактически все, что ты находишь, так или иначе станет полезным. Очень интересная механика боя, умные, но не слишком суровые мобы, способные блокировать твои атаки, уклоняться от стрел, прятаться за укрытиями. К счастью, монстра не ломится на тебя скопом и не гоняет по всем локациям, следовательно игра остается проходимой: всю живность надо завалить собственными руками. 
Невероятная атмосфера мистического подземелья чередуется с живописными открытыми пространствами. Перемещение телепортацией - абсолютный плюс для игры: тебе и так приходится крутиться на 360 градусов, при этом игра не укачивает. 
Реиграбельно. Маст хэв для всех, у кого есть вайв и хотя бы пару квадратных метров свободного пространства.

12/10"
30758794,"Dieses Spiel ist eines der besten VR-Titel für die HTC-Vive, welches ich bislang gespielt habe.

Hier meine positiven und negativen Punkte des Spiels. Unten dran hänge ich dann auch noch einige weitere Ideen, welche ich hätte.

Positiv:
+ Grafik im Comicstil. Man taucht schon in der ersten Sekunde vollkommen ein in diese Welt.
+ Gameplay. Die Waffen funktionieren unglaublich gut und die Schläge sind sehr Präzise. Man hat das Gefühl, man würde       tatsächlich ein Schwert führen oder mit dem Bogen zielen
+ Shops. Es gibt mehrere kleine ""Shops"" in denen man verschiedene Waffen kaufen kann.
+ Waffenarsenal. Die vielfalt an Waffen ist unglaublich gut. Es gibt 3 verschiedene Schweter, einen Hammer, 2 Bögen, einen Zauberstab (Der Mana benötigt) eine 2-Hand Axt und natürlich einen Schild
+ Atmosphäre. Die Atmosphäre ist düster gehalten und stimmt zum Setting.
+ Mining. Man bekommt im Verlauf des Spiels eine Spitzhacke, mit der man Erze abbauen kann. (Die Erze werden entweder zu Gold oder zu Mana)
+ Das 1. Kapitel. Das erste Kapitel ist unglaublich Detailverliebt, man findet überall interessante Dinge und kommt häufig aus dem Staunen nicht raus. (meine Spielzeit betrug für das 1. Kapitel knapp 3,5 Std. was aber auch daran lag, dass ich mir Zeit für das Spiel genommen habe und nicht durchgerusht bin)
+ Teleportieren. Ich hatte nicht ein einziges Mal einen Anflug von Motionsickness.
+ Die Gegner. Es ist ein unbeschreibliches Gefühl vor den Gegner zu stehen. Besonders die Minibosse, welche gut 2,5 - 3m groß sind, sind beeindruckend!
+ Die Kämpfe. Wenn man mit dem Schwert nicht gerade hin- und herwedelt als sei es ein Staubfänger sind die Kämpfe wahnsinnig gut. Spielt man das Spiel mit Blocken/Parieren - Angreifen, dann fordert einen jeder Kampf aufs neue. Ich habe immer darauf geachtet, was der Gegner als nächstes plant, den Angriff bestmöglichst mit dem Schild geblockt oder dem Schwert/Hammer pariert und dann zugeschlagen. Unglaubliches Gefühl!

Negativ:
- Das 2. Kapitel. Nach dem unglaublich guten Start des 1. Kapitels ist das 2. dann wirklich eine große Enttäuschung. Meine Spielzeit betrug gute 30 Minuten, dann war es schon vorbei. Es ist leider nur eine Arena mit allen bekannten Gegnern, welche Wellenartig mit einem im Ring stehen.
- Die 2-Hand-Axt. Das Kämpfen mit dieser Waffe ist eine einzige Tortur. Ich verstehe die Idee dahinter, aber es funktioniert leider so gar nicht :( Schade.
- Nach einem Neustart des Spiels ""spawnen"" alle Erze und Äpfel etc. wieder in der Welt. Das macht einige Erfolge etwas unsinnig.


Meine Ideen für Chapter 3 oder Upgrades von Chapter 1&2
○ Crafting. Man bekommt schon im Spielverlauf eine Spitzhacke in die Hand gedrückt, wieso also nicht auch verschiedene Erze abbauen können und vielleicht an einer Schmiede (Welche irgendwo eingebaut werden könnte) sich seine eigenen Waffen bauen?
○ Interaktion mit den Feuerschalen. Häufig findet man Feuerschalen in einem Raum, das Entzünden bewirkt leider gar nichts. Die Schalen könnte man auch dafür benutzen um Gänge freizuschalten oder Türen zu öffnen, statt immer einen Schlüssel oder Hebel zu suchen
○ NPC's in Shops. Was mir sehr gut gefallen würde wären NPC's mit denen man interagieren muss um Gegenstände zu erwerben.
"
30753256,Best VR Game in my opinion!
30709270,"Ever wanted to actually be Link, inside of a Zelda game? That's what this feels like. Despite the cartoony graphics, I find the combat a bit intense at times, but I'm a wuss. Good level design, good difficulty level (in my opinion), good controls and interface. A real gem of a VR game."
30658239,"October 2019 Edit: Finally, an update and supposedly a sequel? Interesting, but why am I being charged again for what should have been part of the original game. The DLC certainly appears to be what they've been working on and then decided, hey, how about we sell it as a DLC for more than the original price of the game. Despicable.

Wait for this to go on a serious sale, 50% off or more. Than buy. Otherwise, play the ""demo"".

Original: Let me start by saying I really enjoyed my time in this demo of a game. But it does seem like developers took the money and ran. There are many bugs and the game could use some polish. If it goes on sale, it might be worth buying."
30649161,One of the best VR game experiences so far.
30622846," As a 50 year old owner of an IT company that started my career about 35 years ago with the purchase of a Tandy 1000sx with a monochrome monitor for about 2 grand just to play Zork, I have to say this game is awesome and was a real pleasure to play. Not very difficult in combat or puzzles but just plain fun! The best 20 bucks I have spent in a long time. If I were still 17 then I might have thought it was slow.... Graphics are great. I am running this on a 3 year old xeon lenovo workstation with 16 gigs or ram and a fairly decent video card that cost about 200 bucks."
30599730,"I am only giving this game a negative review since one feature is so broken, and that is the save system. Once you trigger a save you cannot go back and save over it. Depending on what you are doing in the game you may go for over an hour without being able to save and then just shutting it off, thus losing all your progress. If they fix this one feature I would instantly recommend it. 

It is not often you see one design flaw so glaringly awful that it takes the rest of the game with it."
30537797,"This game is a definite recommend.

- I loved the adrenalin of sword fights with multiple characters and the fact that the game pauses fast to allow you to centre yourself in the room and not put your controller through the tv during a heated fight.
- I loved ducking out from behind trees at opportune moments and shooting arrows at enemies.
- I liked the riddles in the game that didn't always make sense but weren't that impossible that you never understood them.
- I liked finding hidden treasure and upgrading/buying weapons.
- I probably didn't like that there were many different weapons, I had my favourites which i'm guessing everyone will and then there were weapons i barely touched.

Vanishing realms is just a really nice game that comes to life and is really enjoyable when virtual reality is added. I am looking forward to the next chapters to the game when they are developed"
30528150,Finally a classic sword-n-sorcery VR game and although it's a bare bones game not really RPG in the sense that you can't level up it's still an incredibly fun game!  I hope to see more of this type of game with more advanced gaming features and a full length adventure experience too.
30527059,"Headset: Oculus Rift with 4 Oculus sensors. Everything worked perfectly.
Roomscale is needed as you can't change direction. (Why not add this?)

Time to finish the game: 3.4 hours trying to find all secrets.

* The 19,99€ pricetag is way to high.
* The fighting system was pretty OK and better than expected.

There's nothing very good or bad. Everything is very basic. Graphics, gameplay, level design etc. It's also pretty polished and works well. It fills the void of a genere that sadly is lacking in these early days of VR.

Overall the game was fun the whole way through.

30518264,Great game!
30510267,"I had so much fun fighting these skeletons and shooting apples from trees, I was in there for straight four hours. Best VR experience so far. Sadly I accidentally threw one of the purple cups in the water. Please implement respawn for such items, else I am never able to fullfill this achievement. :)
But all in all great experience and that in early access, well done devs!
Thanks for your great work!"
30499211,good but very short
30474323,"This is ok. Was excepting little bit more because of users reviews. Monsters did scare me couple times and some traps too. Played it 1st time within 2.5hours. This needs locomotion movement and price tag 20usd is too much for current play time. I could see going for second run in harder mode then it would be about 6 hours total for 20usd, it will be over 3usd/hour. Comparing that for arizona sunshine which has price of 40 and ive played that allready almost 50hours (best value for VR game yet).

I really would like to see adventure game like this fully finished so i give thump up, price is just too big for its current state and developer says that its DLC:s might have price. When i get content enough to get me play this again and again at least 20hours i will be happy.

Edit: NOw i am stick to 4 hours, got bored to play it more. This isnt true RPG game, you dont have any character skills to modify or level up. Story is too simple and there is only couple different, very blocky enemies. Not a new hero quest of virtual version."
30461747,"Neat game. I really enjoyed this dungeon romp. I found myself looking under leaves and other things quite often to find the secret items. I also spent time trying to throw things to knock off the chalices in areas where they were too high to reach. I also found myself using cover to shoot the archers and the mages. The bladed trap at the start was a nice idea, I'd like more vr games to have such things. Not many games have you crawling under neath traps to get to things. Good job."
30458169,The battle mechanics are really nice and the story is engrossing. I can't wait for the next chapter!
30454092,"I bought this game on sale thinking it was going to be some 20-30 minute rinky dinky polished VR turd experience. Nope, instead it was the exact opposite. I'm being completely honest here, this game is literally one of the best VR games I've touched on the Vive, all bullsh*t aside. The only other game I've played that actually felt like a FULL game and not a tech demo experience was Lucky's Tale on the Oculus Rift. 

Vanishing Realms took me almost 6 hours to beat, and while that may sound small, that's actually pretty long for a VR title. Honestly I became so immersed in the game that it felt a little bit longer than it actually is due to the sense of presence. In this game you actually FEEL like you're in another world due to the sense of presence, which is most VR titles I think, but this game actually makes you feel like you're a warrior on a quest in a virtual world, it feels legit. The graphics are a bit cartoony but honestly who gives a sh*t? Not this guy.

You fight skeleton warriors, mages, bosses, etc. You can mine ore, use a magic wand, use 3 different types of swords, an axe, hammer, 2 different bows. There's traps to avoid, chalices to collect, not really any puzzles (personally I hate puzzles). The game seems super easy at first, but it starts to get quite challenging. It's not too difficult, but difficult enough that you can't just stand there like a statue swinging your vive controller like an idiot, it requires a bit of tactic and you actually feel like you're fighting a real battle. The enemy AI isn't that great and seems a bit cheap-ish, but I think fighting in this game feels really nice regardless. I used mostly sword, shield, and a bow. The enemies try to swing at you in different ways with their weapons if you fight up close, you can block the incoming attacks with your sword or shield and it feels like you're actually blocking everything, it's very responsive. The game will make you move around a bit (if you have space), and potentially make you work up a sweat lol

I applaud the devs for this, you guys did a really good job. The game isn't super amazing, but it's still a really well made VR title that deserves some attention I think. This is probably the closest thing you're gonna get to an ""Elder Scrolls"", ""Legend of Zelda"" kind of experience on VR at the moment, and for 20 bucks it's not bad. I'd say wait for a sale though and grab it if you own a Vive, you won't regret it I promise. It's definitely worth the money out of all the VR turds I've seen on Steam."
30437990,Another one of my first VR game. Excellent game!
30437144,"This is one of those Vive games that could (and in my mind probably deserves to be) priced higher. There's a lot of fun here, most of it in the world creation and the small areas that flow together well to give you a sense of adventure. The only thing I would like to try is a different, slower locomotion option as the teleporting can allow you to zoom through areas.

The combat is challenging (if not a slight bit wonky) but the weapons are all fun to use. The enemy designs are all really cool too. Threatening in a cartooish way that doesn't come off as silly.

What this game nails though is the overall mood and feel of each area. The spooky castles, the swamps, grand halls filled with fire mages. Each new fight is a new challenge and the backdrops can really add to the tension in some areas.

I've played through the campaign twice now (and will be going through again on Hard Mode soon). I'd seriously recommend this game to anyone just getting in to VR. Hopefully this is a taste of further things to come not from just this dev but others."
30414934,"This is one game I do not regret at all spending money on. There are only so many wave shooters you can play before you need a taste of something sweeter. Vanishing Realms is the cake, with the cherry on top.

I love the enviroments and spent an age just gazing up at the sky or celling. The game experience may be short but I had a blast from the opening screen right to the end. It's the little touches that I loved. That gold cup stood high up on a plinth. Grab a rock, knock the bugger down. Trophy trapped on a wall in a web, burn it free. I felt involved. In an early part of the game I was laying on the floor crawling past some axe's, much to my wife's amusement. The wand feels great to use, blocking attacks with your sword or shield is cool, but the bow and arrow for me is the stand out weapon in the game. It just felt right.

Sure it's not perfect. Combat feels a little simple. Definitely helps to have a large play area. Mine is fairly large at 2m x 4m and the 2m can cause movement issues. You will find yourself teleporting often just to get where you need to be, but please don't let that put you off. I have played in a 2m x 2m area before I relocated the vive and it still plays fine.

To sum up. Buy this game. If you don't enjoy the genre then walk around the area's and look about. Jaw dropping I feel. You may well of spent in excess of 2 grand for a dedicated pc and vr headset, what's £15 on top of that. Just get it."
30393547,Do you always wanted to go into a dungeon and explore for loot and power? This game is that and it plays really well. For 20 dollars you will be getting a lot of hours from this vr experience.
30385595,"This is a sold game as it sits right now. Anything they add to it will be awesome! played it through & I'm glad i purchased it. 
Solid purchass."
30346216,"One of the best VR games out there
"
30344021,"Took about 6 hours to finsh this from start to finsh - it was alot of fun - this short game stands right at the top of VR games available now.  The game it very playable - shoot arrows, throw fireballs, swing the sword and block with the shield and dont forget if you have low ceilings that the overhead sword swing might take a chunk out of it before it hits the target.  lol ... loved it and fully recommend it!!"
30335313,"I have just finished the 2 chapters yesterday and I must say, it a really amazing VR game. You do not want to miss this one.
It is not only a story where you are looking for stuff, gold and several lost calices but it is also a really physical game. You can get really tired after having battled against those skeleton. Using the bow can make your arms felt very heavy at the end.
On the two chapters, I have had only one tiny bug:
At the end of chapter one, just after the last save point, I was missing one calice and decided to go back and find it.
I succeed to get it somewhere in the outdoor area, inside a dead tree. Then I came back to finalize chapter one but the path was closed. This is the path just after the last big guy on chapter one. You go into a ""zig zag"" between rocks and then you go outside where you can see the temple with the swords. This path was closed when I went back here; I have had to go  to the other way around from the begining of the story to get into this temple with the 3 swords and then go to the last step to chapter 2.

I can't wait to see the next chapters.
Very well done folks. This is a very good job."
30330543,Played through this game on my Oculus Rift a while ago and loved it. If only it didnt crash the Rift every 20 minutes. If this guy could hire some friends and get this game going a bit quicker he can keep taking my money. 10/10
30330245,"best vr game ive played to date, thank you so much for putting this out.I had so much fun! cant play for long cuz the vr not used to it yet.

30296946,"I was about to fight a Skeleton King, and I thought to myself, I'm not afraid of no Skeleton King! Naturally, I decided I was going to smack my sword on my shield and yell before I ran into battle...and the game fuckin let me smack my sword on my shield exactly how I envisioned it in my head.

10/10 - I would smack my sword on my shield again."
30271777,"Only 2 levels, with apparently no plans to release any more content.  Move it out of Early Access if you're done with it!  First level was the best VR experience I've had to date and ALMOST worth the $20 price tag.  Second level, an arena wave fighter, was a nice change of pace and a lot of fun, but I was ready for another level like the first.  Instead I was presented with a link to exit the game.  $20 is steep IMO for what equates to 1 dungeon and a minigame.  Hopefully future purchasers will see this review and at least know what they're buying."
30252787,VR游戏里尝试性的RPG游戏，值得体验。
30250339,"How fantastic!  It's a little short, but what an amazing effort for a single dev!  Wow!

Kudos!  

I'm old, and since the first time I played D&D at like 13 I've wanted the experience of walking around in the game like this.  Seriously, I can't believe it finally happened.

I hope you are able to get a large budget to create a game like skyrim scale.

I still can't belive this was a solo thing.  Is the VR market still too small to make a living at this?  Hopefully VR is here to stay and you can get yourself funded well enough to hire folks and crank out the awesome.

Great work man, thanks for the experience and I hope you are able to keep it coming (like double the current content in this game would be a nice start).
"
30245778,"PROS:
Excellent game and world design give good immersion
Good balance of puzzles, combat and looting
Fun combat both melee and ranged with blocking mechanic
Fun puzzles/challenges that start simple and get harder
Devs seem to be committed to updating and improving
Possibility of open world map in the future has been talked about


CONS:
Bit lacking in the story department text only no real sotry
Short tutorial doesn't teach you much 
Game length needs to be longer or have path choices bit linear
Some of the AI enemies are simple to defeat unless in groups


This is a fantastic VR game and really show cases what the technology is capable of doing at the moment. If you have a nice powerful i7 and GTX 1080 up the supersampling in your Steam VR settings and it's super crisp. Even on my older card before I upgraded this was nice looking and fun to play.

This game really reminds me of the 80s & 90s TV kids game show Knightmare where a team of friends guided a 4th mate through a quest and lots of fun challenges in a computer generated world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare

There is a lot of immersion due to the cool scenery and sound effects and the dungeon setting is modeled very well indeed. I can only imagine in 5 years time the way VR is going we're going to have more games like this featuring multiplayer, playable classes and much bigger open worlds.

Vanishing Realms is essentially a dungeon crawl hack and slash game with combat, looting and puzzles there isn't any real story or character leveling though. You explore a vast dungeon/castle solving puzzles and collecting treasure which allows you to buy various weapons and armour along the way to help fight skeletons and other monsters. Combat is fun featuring melee and ranged but difficulty wise only a few of the enemies are hard.

Think Knightmare mixed with a little bit of Zelda and you have this game!

The combat features blocking and attacking in various ways like stabbing and slashing with range weapons as an option like bows. As I said the combat is not highly skilled by normal RPG standards but it's still very fun and engaging requiring timing to block or dodge attacks. I can only imagine what I must look like in my VIVE swinging my hand around to stab and raising my other hand to block with my shield. The standard enemies are simple enough to beat but the bosses and bigger ones prove more difficult. That said when you encounter more than one enemy at a time it keeps you on your toes.
 
This game has all the usual dungeon crawler puzzles and challenges to workout along the way. The fact the devs added climbing and different movement options recently has made the game better. I'd love to see character classes and more open world stuff added one day.

I initially downloaded a torrent copy but after my first 20 minutes I went and bought it and I am happy to support the developer if they make more games of this standard. The only thing I'll say it's not really a roleplaying game as the story is quite basic in the form of text it would be nice to have some narration perhaps in future updates and a bit more choice of where to go and explore in the form of different paths to complete the game.

I would defiantly say this is one of the best VR games around at the moment and I'm amazed it's early access it feels like a completed game. Some people have complained about play time but the price is just about right at £15.

Most people say this has an average 3-5 hours play time."
30234948,"If you've never played RPG in VR like me. It's a nice one to start with, IMO.
You can find and pick up coins, buy swords, fuck things up, and maybe others I don't known"
30234475,"After playing a few other VR games on my new Vive, me and my roommate were wanting something that felt like it had more depth. This way that game. It feels wonderful, the combat feels engaging and responsive. I wish I could throw skulls better than I can, although this was the first game that had me full on hit a wall without realizing it. 10/10 would definitely recommend. Skeletons are frightening."
30226816,"Dieses Spiel zeigt, was in VR möglich ist. Im Prinzip haben wir es hier mit einem Dungeon Crawler zu tun, bei dem sich der Spieler durch recht lineare Level kämpft und rätselt. Allerdings ist die Spielmechanik perfekt auf VR und Roomscale abgestimmt. Schwertkämpfe gegen Skelettkrieger sind zum Beispiel ein echtes Highlight und auch andere scheinbar belanglose Spielmechaniken, wie das entzünden von Feuerschalen mit einer Fackel, das Bogenschießen oder das Gewinnen von Rohstoffen mit einer Spitzhacke werden durch die Bewegungscontroller der Vive zu einem Erlebnis. Bleibt nur zu hoffen, dass aus dem Early Acess-Titel irgendwann ein fertiges und vollwertiges Spiel wird. Schon jetzt eines der besten VR-Erlebnisse."
30226107,"Really enjoyed this game, the best experience I've had with my vive."
30214733,"I generally don't have issues running Vive games with Oculus, this is one of the rare ones that I do.

A lot of other rift users have reported the same issue of tracking degredation over time which I believe is a call the game is making for updated information repeatedly to vserver, eventually vserver jams which carries over the game and causes that to jam as well.

I won't be rating the game any lower because of that as the 10 minutes I can play each time are quite a good example of why you SHOULD have support (the same reason I won't be asking for a refund) but please do look at converting what you DO have to the Oculus native system engine wise and let the game decide which to call on it's own ;)

Keep up the good work and know that there are a bunch of us Rift users looking to play your game when you get us over to it!"
30213682,"This is a game that you need to own. It's a refreshing breath of something new in the otherwise wave shooter saturated VR market. If you own a vive, you should own this game.

The combat is really fun, the world immersive, and the game makes you want to keep playing. Even at this early stage combat feels fairly well matched if you are up for a fight (rather than just picking people off with your bow). The art style is well suited for the game.

Now, it is an early access game and as such some bugs are to be expected. I haven't run across anythign game breaking yet, but expect the odd hit that shouldn't have hit, and the occasional platform that is accessible that shouldn't be. The game is also a little shy for content, but the developer is active and I don't think any more could be expected for an early access game."
30212156,"One of the best VR games out there. You inhabit a beautiful fantasy world with some very attractive art direction. The combat is the best, very refined, you have full control and most importantly it is fun as hell! You really get a sense of being on a fantasy adventure, like being in it, the beauty of VR."
30211122,"Love it.  Great interface and ""feel"" to the game.  The virtual ""belt"" is a great design.  Very intuitive.  Being able to use cover while exchanging arrow shots with the enemy is an absolute blast.  It's games like this that prove VR is here to stay.   The last part is key...this is an actual great VR game...not just a demo!"
30210217,"Oh man, they did a really good job with this game. Everything from the sword fighting to mining gold in the game is a blast. Collisions are very good (and need to be for immersion to hold up). When your sword hits theirs (parry) it seems very accurate. I want to fight more bosses, and I want them to be bigger and meaner. I'm really looking forward to other games that are built on top of this one, there is so much potential here...Guys, you really need to boycott all non-VR and non-AR games, this is what games are meant to be like. You can never play a sword-fighting game again in non-VR after this experience. I took my time and beat the game in 3 hours, you could probably beat it in 1 hour but I'd still say it's definitely worth $20."
30205640,"This was one of my first Vive games, and I absolutely loved it."
30204768,"I really enjoyed my first playthrough with this title. It's one of the few ""complete"" titles out there yet still seems to be in early access. The gameplay mechanics, story line, and overall polished feel of the game make this a title I can definitely recommend. I give this two Vive controllers up!"

30200863,"Лучшая VR RPG на текущий момент ИМХО. Рекомендую.

Большая комната, кстати, совсем необязательна - у меня 1,2 на 1,2 (STEAM VR определяет как ""СТОЯ"") - хватает вполне."
30190782,"J'ai terminé il y a quelques mois Vanishing Realms sur une note un peu mitigée. L'expérience était à la hauteur, mais je trouvais que l'on arrivait trop rapidement à la fin. Le jeu ne semblait en effet qu'un gros tuto (acquérir la technique de déplacement, du combat à l'épée, du maniement du bouclier, de l'arc puis du pic), la partie jeu se terminant très vite.

Or, en le reprenant ces derniers jours, je m'apperçois que le contenu a été enrichi, des passages secrets, de nouvelles salles et énigmes à résoudre.

Tant mieux. Vu qu'il s'agit du meilleur RPG auquel j'ai joué en VR, c'est que du positif.
Les ennemis ont un petit côté cartoon que j'ai trouvé sympa. Sa gestion de l'inventaire à la ceinture était la première que je voyais aussi bien pensée (d'autres ont fait mieux depuis). Le jeu se raccroche à un scénario qui a le mérite d'exister, mais le jeu reste quand même principalement linéaire. Mais je me plais à chercher les pièces et autres objets de valeur, à combattre ces ennemis un peu balourds.

30152901,"I innitially gave this a thumbs down, but I have now changed that. It needs more content and some character progression, but it's a cool, cheap game."
30130474,"This is a real great experience and a very entertaining game!
Nice graphic, nice sounds effects, but the dream come true for a rpg (pen and paper or videogame) fan!
Exploring the areas with a torch in a hand and a sword in the other, combat is something near real-combat, where you have to swipe your weapon and raise your shield. Enemy AI in combat is very good: they parry, strafe, try to predict your attacks basing on the positioning of your weapon etc etc.
Great work, please keep on with the story!"
30129388,"This game is easily my favorite VR game. Loved dungeon crawling in VR, finding new weapons, and the combat was really enjoyable. Only con for me is the game was shorter than I wanted. Hope to see more games like this!"
30107412,"This is a really immersive game. I like it alot. The only thing that bugs me is the random save points and inability to save wherever you are. I've had to repeat the same sequence a number of times to the point where I dread logging in again just to try and find the next save point. This is a detterent to me wanting to play. Overall it really showcases the Vive's ability very well. I just wish I could save wherever I am at when i need to be done playing, and not have to repeat things over and over again until I happen upon the next save point."
30084778,"Worth every penny. It isn't very long and the graphics are a little rough, but I have never had so much fun playing a VR game yet. This is the dungeon crawler you had dreams about as a kid. What a time to be alive!!"
30078119,"Hab das Game jetzt in grob 4 Stunden durchgespielt. Nun versuche ich meine Erfahrung so gut es geht zu beschreiben.
Vanishing Realms war eins der ersten VR Games das ich ganz durchgespielt habe im Rythmus 2Std Game/ Pause / 2Std Game.

Die Story

Die Story ist jetzt keine große Überraschung es orientiert sich halt an den guten klasischen Adventure/RPG Games. Untote und ein Held der gegen sie ins Feld zieht und versucht den König der Untoten nieder zu ringen. Man bekommt immer wieder Story und Gamplay wichtige Texte entweder per Sprachausgabe von Steinköpfen die an Wänden hängen, Gegnern oder aus Schriftrollen und Büchern.

Steuerung

Diese wird am Anfang ausreichend erklärt. Jedoch gibt es einige Aspekte die man selber erstmal im Game ausprobieren muss. Besonders positiv finde ich das Inventar was viel zum erleben des Spiels beiträgt. Schneller Wechsel der Waffen und auch gute Inventargröße. Das Teleportieren hilft gerade am Anfang sich an VR zu gewöhnen im Gegensatz zu Titeln wie Yore VR oder Onward. 
Die Motionsickness ist je nach Spieler bei Vanishing Realms abhängig. Mir machte es nach 2 Std nix mehr aus also eine 2/10 für Motionsickness. (Durch das Game wurde auch meine Motionsickness bei Spielen wie Onward besser also Trainingsgame falls ihr Motionsickness anfällig seid)

Spielerlebnis

es gibt viel zu entdecken in Vanishing Realms. Über Geheime Räume bis zu versteckten Gegenständen. Und sogar ein Schatzkarten Rätsel. Es gibt Spitzhacken zum Abbau von Material. Achivment Gegnestände. uvm.
Die Gegner sind unterschiedlich man muss sich einstellen. Es gibt ""Standart Soldaten"", ""Hauptmänner"" , ""Zwischenbosse/Berserker"", Und auch Heiler und Magier. Also für Abwechslung ist gesorgt. 

Gegner sind zwar meist wenig bewegungsfreudig vor allem die Standartgegner aber.... nach einigen Versuchen sie mit nem Bogen zu snipern waren ihre Ausweich Dashes 1a. Auch die Angriffscombos der ""Hauptmänner"" bleiben zwar relativ gleich aber sie haben 2-3 Moves die einen echt in Bedrängnis bringen. Also man brauch schon einen Gewissen Platz um auf die Angriffe zu reagieren. Ich würde die Spielzone definitiv auf 2 x 2 Meter einrichten. Sonst gibts bei stärkeren Gegnern wie z.B Berserker da ihr euch viel bewegt probleme das ihr irgendwo gegen klatscht.

Sound
Sehr stimmig. Es gibt keine Fehler wie fehlende Sounds oder Delays. Die Stimmen die verwendet werden passen sehr gut tragen gut zum erleben dieser Welt bei. 

Grafik

Finde sie erinnert mich vom Aussehen her an Torchlight. Finde sie aber sehr stimmig und passend es gibt 1-2 Sachen die mir aufgefallen sind wo man paar Probleme merkt aber im Gegnsatz zu anderen Early Access Titeln ist das echt zu vergeben. Die Gegner sind schön gestaltet wenn man den Stil mag Und auch Landschaftlich finde ich die Grafik ansprechend. Sonst hätte das Spiel es nicht geschafft mich volle 4 Stunden zu fesseln.

Fazit

Solides Early Access Spiel wenn man sich erstmal in VR zurecht finden muss und erstmal gucken will was die Spiele können. Die 19,99 € sind finde ich gerechtfertigt es kommen ja noch Episoden dazu. Und finde es gibt andere VR Games die Early Access sind und nen Haufen Geld verlangen aber ich finde ungerechtfertigt. 30 - 40 € für paar Level oder sogar nur eins ist ein wenig viel Übertreibung

Also klare Produkt Empfehlung.

30071783,"This is the game I dreamed about when I first saw VR back in college when it cost 100s of thousands dollars for the technology. It's not super long, nor is it overly hard but it was a lot of fun. I recommend it highly."
30058302,"This is a great dungeon crawler action rpg game for VR! If you looking for a game like this and are thinking about buying it, don't hesitate just do it and you won't be disspointed :-)"
30051452,"This is, undoubtedly, the best VR experience I have ever experienced. Similarly, it just may be one of my favorite games of all time. The level of immersion you get here is REAL. The fighting feels challenging, but fair. The environments are interesting, and you WANT to explore them. I would give this a 10/10, anyone who owns an HTC Vive should play this game!

Update: I have now beat the game and can say that my initial review still stands 100%. The length of the game is actually pretty good (especially for VR) and has a great ending."
30045393,"Absolutely the best game I have played on my Vive (and I have over 60 VR games). 

It's a fully fledged dungeon crawler where you explore, solve puzzles, defeat many types of enemy with Sword & Shield, Hammer, Bow or Magic Wand and mine for gold and jewels along the way.

The game includes the 1st two chapters of what may turn into a series of episodes, but even though it is only 2 chapters - it's a full game with a proper ending. I've just completed it and would love to buy more episodes if they became available.

Well done to Indimo Labs for this excellent adventure. I really hope they will release more titles soon!"

29863312,"Great short game, felt like a love child of Legend of Zelda and Fable. Still an infant and has room to grow though."
29850257,"The 1980s were an exciting era when I powered up my PC with the video games Ultima, Bards Tale, and Might and Magic.  late nights and marathon play sessions with my brother through those fantasy adventures forging our heroic tales along the way. 
 
I did not realize it at the time but looking back I think that I had made a sort of deal with the developers of those games.  They were building something that we all desperatly wanted.  They were the first in an emerging technology and art form.   As expected the games were limited by the tech, rough around the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  There needed a forgiving partnership that filled the hours with enjoyment.  I the consumer would contribute to the game as I played.  I would flesh out their stories, fill in the gaps and use my imagination to create things that were not there to imerse myself in the world they created.  

As I play Vanishing Realm I feel like this partnership is a chief requirement to my experience.  Vanishing Realm is once again the realization of a child of the 80s dream.  Like I was so many years ago I find myself needing to fill in the gaps and flesh out the world to make it work.  

Vanishing It is obviously a small project, in an emerging technology, by an indie developer.  As expected it is short in content, rough on the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  If I left it there my sleep-deprived-UltimaIV younger self would die a painful death.  With the short comings aside this game is absolutly a thrill that I have been waiting for years to play.  It is everything I hoped a VR RPG could be, and sets the stage for so much more to come.  This game plucks the heart strings of my 80s inner child.  It is that dream of D&D on the computer and playing in a fantasy world turned into being inside the RPG game.

When I play vanishing realm I see the past, the present and the future at the same time and it is a glorious experience.  I gladly pay the money for what this game is, how it stirs my soul, and what it provides in a glimps to the future.
"
29809722,"If you own an HMD you should definitely play this game. As I'm writing this it's in early access but is already more of a ""real game"" than the common ""just a tech demo"" complaint we've seen with a lot of VR titles."
29795917,"One of the few full fledged (non-demo) VR games out there. It's quite an adventure, and will really get your heart pumping at times. I would hightly recommend this game for HTC Vive users!"
29781776,"Vanishing Realms is a really good demonstration of the power of VR. As a traditional hack-and-slash dungeon crawler this wouldn't merit more than a footnote. Basic dungeons, fairly limited amount of items and monsters and so on. However as a VR title this really shines. It's entirely different to dodge the fireball yourself. Or to succesfully block a skeletons upper strike to leave it open for a counter-attack when you have to actually swing both the shield and the sword. The full freedom to choose which weapons and/or tools to carry in your hands lets the player choose their own approach. And make mistakes.
The game benefits quite a bit from having a larger room-scale setup due to easier positioning and maneuvering.
In short, kind of hard to consider this an early access game. There is quite a bit more content here than in many ""full release"" VR games.
PS Careful with that torch."
29771734,"also ich muss sagen das war das erste spiel was ich mir gekauft hab als ich meine vive bekommen habe und ich bereue keinen cent.
die grafik das spielkonzept einfach klasse freue mich auf mehr sollche genres.
die steuerung sitzt und die umgebung ist auch schön anzusehen.
sehr empfehlendswert."
29756631,"Great game, well done mechanics and story. Cannot wait to see what comes next"
29746966,Absolutely awesome. Can not wait for the other chapters! If you have a VR headset definitely recommended!
29726339,Gran bel gioco!! In VR e' uno spettacolo e... aiuta a fare attività fisica :)
29699707,"This game is incredible, immense fun. Exploring and fighting your way through a fanasy world, as though you were really there. It is what I thought VR was all about, great immersion and getting you up and moving around. We need more of this of this game and more like it!"
29691793,"Forse una delle migliori esperienze vr. Comandi e feedback ben fatti, gameplay e ambiente che ricordano i gdr classici ma in vr è semplicemente di un altro livello
Ben presto mi sono trovato a lanciare sfide ai nemici  o ad accovaciarsi per nascondersi dietro una pietra. La semplice azione di Raccogliere l'oro o profanare bare sono già divertentissime. Probabilmente se non fosse in vr avrei finito il gioco in brevissimo tempo e sarei molto deluso, grafica meh, nulla di innovativo,... ma invece approvo in pieno. Ultima cosa difetto comune  a molti giochi vr non riesco a fare sezioni lunghe di 3 4 ore come al mio solito, ma dopo 30/50 minuti devo staccare. Non per motion sickness ma inccoccare 30 freccie di fila dopo una giornata di lavoro stanca, però la room scale è veramente fantastica."
29685395,"Quite possibly the best game I have ever played. I had a friend over that is also a child of the 80s and when he put on the oculus to see himself in here having realistic sword fights with freakin ogres and running around my living room, he paused and said ' Wow, they did it. They really did it. What we dreamed of.""
Just get the freaking game. It's a masterpiece of immersion into a fantasy word. If the dev reads this.. MORE PLEASE! And make this an MMO. Then I can die happy."
29681262,Great way to spend a couple of hours.  Very entertaining as you dive deeper into the storyline and upgrade your weapons. Highly recommend!
29680064,Great game!  Feels like you are exploring a fun magical world.
29675061,Fun! I like the inventory system and the weapons. Story and narrative is quite simple but it works. I would love more secrets and stuff to interact with in different ways.
29666957,One of the first made-for-VR games I've played that did not feel like a minigame. This is a must have for Vive owners.
29662209,"I have been playing video games since the age of 8, I built my own gaming PC several years ago, and still love to play games. But in all my years spent gaming, NEVER before has a game provoked me to writing a review for other potential players.. until now. 

I have been burned on serveral ""Early access"" games before and eventually decided I would not buy another ever again. However on a whim I decided to buy this one for my VIVE only because of the insane amount of positive reviews, and I have absolutley no regrets whatsoever. This game has surpassed my expectations, and blown me away with the incredible techniques that were designed to interact with the game, all the while amazing me with the (better than I expected) game play.

10/10 Would buy like 3 more times."
29661627,its a great game. really like how they perefected RPG in this. It made you fell like you were actually a character from an RPG game going on an amazing and fantastical journey. love the health mana and storage system. good animation and character design and addictive
29661045,"Great games, I played it straight through until I beat it.  It only has a few hours of play per campaign, but they are epic and it is not yet finished."
29650885,"I don't write reviews but after two play throughs, I have to let the Dev's know that they have done an awesome job on this game. Possibly my favourite VR experience so far. Combat in Hard Mode is great fun and you actually have to get skillful with weapons to progress, it's a great feeling. They have nailed the dungeon exploration  atmosphere perfectly, I cannot wait for the new chapters. Well done and thank you! https://www.twitch.tv/videos/119020084"
29639082,"One of those ""must have"" Vive titles that everyone goes crazy over. The puzzles are engaging, the free form of the game play is just loose enough so you feel like you have freedom, but tight enough so you never get lost. Really good level design. My only gripe, despite this being early access and thus only 2 chapter of the game is completed (I beat it in 3 hours), is that the enemy art doesn't match the in game skeletons (IE Dead bodies of old adventurers) or illustration art. They feel like they were bought in some kind of asset pack, like they don't fit with other art elements in the game. The background also reminds me of things I've seen in the low poly ""hand painting"" 3d models...  But really don't let that bother you, the game is very easy to get lost in.  I beat it in one standing, it's seriously that good. The archery is spot on, and the melee is fun, but can be a bit cumbersome. I love the inventory system! This game feels like the ground work for a much bigger game. Like it's a test of the game mechanic systems and there will be some other game built on this really polished ""prototype"". Anyway, I liked it a lot."
29631974,"J'ai beaucoup aimé ce jeu (mon premier sur Steam VR).
Dommage qu'il soit si court ;-)
En tout cas pour une première expérience de VR j'étais surpris en bien car l'immersion était au rendez-vous et le jeu en lui-même très bien."
29628171,Really good cartoon graphics and as one of the first RPGs im impressed. Some locomotion would be a great addition.
29617071,"So far I have played about two hours and it's been fun.
No motion sickness, no crashes, no lag. So technically the game is sound.
Gameplay wise it's not perfect, but I it works nicely. The enemies behave ok, not too smart but the game has some small tricks to avoid it getting to easy. I like to shoot enemies from a distances. But after a few hits enemies start dodging and blocking the arrows. So I have to go out and fight them. Only some big enemies are easy to kill that way.
The fighting in the game feels good. You can block enemies and hit the vulnerable parts with your weapon. That feels quite natural. When you hit the helmet, shield or weapon of the enemy you don't deal any damage. :D
To buy weapons you have to collect gold. That is hidden everywhere, so I always pick up every item I can to see if there is a coin hidden underneath. :)
I'm looking forward to play more and hope more games will be this much fun.
"
29613228,"Extremly good game, immersive,  fighting, using the VR-tech pretty fine. Good job"
29602427,"Took me about 3-4hours to complete the 2 chapters without looking at any solutions and completed most of the achievements. Haven't played the warriors challenge yet though.

Can't recommend this game enough!! I loved every minute of it - its really made me hunger for a full fledged VR RPG!

Be careful though, even with a decent VR space (almost 3mx3m) i still hit the wall once or twice because I was moving around alot.
"
29582113,"Because of the main mode of locomotion being the teleport and most hostiles take more than a few hits, Vanishing Realms give me the impression of what Legend of Grimrock should be in VR if incorporated nicely as a slow paced action fueled RPG.

Main concepts:
- Teleport
- Careful strikes of opponents wth more than a few hits
- Ai dodges attacks, reacts to your controller position but does not engage until in the vicinity of its combat area
(Main reason that gives you a sort of turn based RPG feel)
- Making slow paced/turn based concept to admire the scenery, ambiance and surrounding
- Progress and not free form based inventory, you collect them and fit into an inventory belt
- Puzzles are minor, its more of travelling, clearing zones and figuring out the entire chapter
- Traps, loot and quest items slow you down to appreciate the levels and design of the chapter

As a player of both Grimrock and Skyrim, this seems like a mash up of both. Not as hard core as either as you don't move per block as grimrock with hardcore puzzles nor do enemies come charging at you. You can dodge easily with well timed teleports thus the immersion of full rpg like skyrim is not there along with enemies only being triggered at their areas.

I think this is where vanishing realms shines, it knows the sacrifice it is taking, making gameplay as such, because it wants to deliver exactly what I described above and to be honest, I do prefer to have one RPG reflecting Legend of Grimrock more in VR, and this game is probably it if it had more levels, more intricate stories, more spells, more complex around the chapter puzzles, more bosses, more maps and the ability to combine at least one type of thing, say a rune/gem or crafting certain consumable items or even quest items, might as well add more diverse quest items. All the above is already promised for chapter 2, and the forth coming chapters, so I have no doubt the developers will continue to make it more towards Legend of Grimrock VR than Skyrim VR, which is what it should be.

If you are already a Legend of Grimrock fan and just joined the VR clan, this is definitely your go to before the dev adds more chapters for the fine tuned turn based action rpg that almost mimic systems like DnD into VR, it supports Vive and Oculus, I'm on experimental 360 2 sensors and have the common glitches you'd get from experimental setup, no diff from an oculus game in certain situations"
29556342,"Just want to say that this is really cool.  VERY immersive.   Exactly what VR should be.  I love combat as it feels like you are actully doing battle.  Torches and lighting candles is cool.  Bows are fun.  Just a great experience.  BTW im using Oculus and can confirm that it plays just fine, if any fellow Oculus players were hesitant about purchasing."
29542663,"Great Game ! It was the first big VR Experience for me that i will never forget. 
After a couple of houers in game I must say, it feels like a lot of contet is still missing. Maybe we will see more in future updates. Keep it up !"
29541835,"very good. but annoying bug whereby if contuning after a save point and end up using up gold coins, then when the game re-starts you can be completely stuck with not enough gold to purchase items required to progress.

I am currently stuck with no gold to buy the bow, despite having progressed beyond this point.  nothing I can do, but re-start at a much earlier timepoint"
29539494,Overall a very good VR game.
29538848,"Wow, ich bin wirklich begeistert. Dieses Spiel beweist, dass es nicht unbedingt die realistischste Grafik benötigt um echte Immersion zu erzeugen. Die Kämpfe sind im Großen und Ganzen echt interessant gestaltet und entfalten durch die coole Bogen und Schild / Schwert Mechanik ein tolles Flair. Was mich ein wenig ernüchtert ist die Tatsache, dass im späteren Spielverlauf das Spiel ein wenig Kampflastiger wird. Aber es ist ja quasi noch im Early Access und wer weiss was noch hinzu kommt.

Ich persönlich hätte mir ein wenig mehr Exploring oder Rätsel gewünscht.Dies ist aber wirklich nur mein ganz persönlicher Geschmack.

Den Kauf bereue ich trotzalledem kein bisschen."
29535327,"Legend of Zelda and Legend of Grimrock mixed together in one of the most engrossing dungeon crawlers I've played. The story is shallow to non-existent but it's still early days and frankly the VR experience is visceral enough to set the stage.

Pro: Inventory management is intuitive and easy to work with.
Pro: Weapons are varied and offer different ways to tackle the same problem or puzzle.

Con: You're going to find out that no matter how much room space you've devoted to this game you're gonna want more. Time to clear out the dining room."
29527171,"Fantastic game, leads you in gentle. The graphics are great, when I first saw them since they are cartony I was taken aback but it really works and the world is solid.
It was the first game that I started to forget about the chaperone walls ;)  There are inside and outside places as you travel through.
Well worth it, can't wait for more."
29497235,This is my first review despite having almost 300 games on steam. This is a fully featured game and one of the best experiences I've had in gaming in many years. That sense of wonder I always chase since the Atari 2600 is rarely found and playing this for an extended time gave me that. That's the best recommendation I can give.
29496488,Very cool so far feels a bit like a zelda game if they do some more unique bosses. i have a lot of game left to go as far as i can tell once this game is out of dev it may be a long game. this game has been fun  and is an OG vr title and has some dev activity so it seems on track so grow. hope to see a lot more from this game very cool.
29494950,"A bit on the short side,  but clearly one of the best Vve games so far.  It takes the traditinal adventure game and brings it into VR with a near perfect mix od controls for this tech. There is still room for improvement; the equip menu sometimes gets in the way of picking items up frok the floor & for some reason all items migrate to my right sachel every time the game is reloaded.  The swordplay combat is loads of fun and truly shows the potential of room scale VR, and can even be a light workot to boot.

One random game element I found suprisingly immersve wasnt even a critical part of the game, but a campground in the background complete with a tent that you could actually get on the ground and crawl into (no teleporting inside this little easter egg).  While in there you can light a candle and have a meal of bread and cheese waiting for you.  If i could quickly get back to that spot, i'd use it as one of my go to demos of the vvw to friens/family that havent tried it before."
29475421,This is exactly what I got vr for. Getting goodies and killing bad guys with your own two hands! Best game by far I have played so far.
29473082,"This is a truly awesome game. Loads of atmosphere. Great graphics. Great immersion. Loved it. If only it were longer. It could also do with a more logical ""save game"" system (allow the player to choose the save game slots, and when the game is ended, pick it up *exactly* where the player left, and not at some other point).

It depends on personal preference of course. If shoot-em-ups like Space Pirate Trainer is your style of game then Vanishing Realms might not be your thing, but if you like RPGs / adventures / dungeon crawlers then I can't lay enough praise on Vanishing Realms."
29469704,"Very enjoyable, dungeon crawl style game. Took about 3 hours to go through my first play through. I don't think I solved everything,



"
29469363,"still the best RPG style game out for the vive, even after playing vr for 8 months and trying over 100 vr titles :)"
29461218,"The single most immersive video game I have played. VR is immersive by itself, but the world is so well done, it becomes completely believable. The music is great, the art style is perfect, the environments are varied, beautiful, and interesting to explore. There are mysteries I have not yet discovered, which just thinking about it makes me want to go back."
29441574,"cansado de los shooters, este juego es un soplo de aire fresco, los movimientos de las armas espada, escudo arcos son perfectos, soy de los que se dejan llevar por las imagenes y la verdad es que los graficos no son punteros, pero se te olvida este pequeño detalle por la ambientacion que consigue el juego, me ha enganchado mas que cualquier juego de rv, no marea nada, el rendimiento es fantastico.
por fin algo decente en rv"
29428175,"Unbelievable! This is like Zelda and you are really the Link in the game! That is the first VR game  i have seen. 
Update: The game is also very short. Only 3-4 hours, but it was good!"
29426898,"This game is awesome, it is the type of game I wanted to play the most when I purchased my HTC Vive.  An immersive RPG, you have to manipulate your surroundings to solve puzzles, battle the evils around you as you explore the caves and outdoor areas.  I can't wait for more content/chapters to become available for this game, I've already competed the game but will be going back in for another run soon (probably when I'm done writing this review).  Something I would like to see in this game and other VR related content would be a full body, it would add to the experience if when you look down you see you.  This could add a whole new dynamic, instead of walking over a hole, you fall in.  Now I'm going to say a dirty word, ""exercise"", bobbing and weaving, blocking and swinging, much more fun than hitting keys on a keyboard."
29423571,OH My GOD !!! V.R Done perfectly. It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ..... wait ..... wait ..... sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.
29412653,"Best experience in VR so far - amazing to play at room scale in a large room. 
Make sure you selet Hard Mode!
It reminds me a lot of the Fable1 in that its easily apprachable, has a low skill cap but that doesnt detract from the overall immersion.
From the changing atmospherice soundtrack from each area to the nice puzzles.
Its a definite must play so far."
29411672,"Probably one of the best VR games out there for the HTC Vive. I would rank it right up there with Arizona Sunshine, and in some ways, I would even say its the better experience. Real skill based sword fighting, great boss fights, good graphics, reminds me a lot of Zelda, but in VR, and with real sword fighting/bow shooting."
29402789,"This has had me, my wife, and 12 year old daughter competing for  Vive time since we got it.  Great fun, immersive and accessible.  A joy to play."
29399199,"良質なアクションRPGです。
また、現時点で数少ない「完品」のVRゲームだと思います。
剣で切り付ける、魔法を操る、弓を射るVRゲームはたくさんありますが、これら全てがゲームの世界観と結びつき、没入感の高い高度なゲームシステムを構築しています。
盾と剣での戦闘においても、単品のソードゲームよりも敵のモーションが豊かで、臨場感に勝ります。
未だクリアは（意図的に）しておらず、ボリュームはそれほどないようですが、それを補って余りあるほどのVR体験ができる作品だと思います。
日本語化はされていませんが、それほど難しい謎解きはなく、辺りをぶらついていればなんとなく進んでいける難易度です。
ゲームシステムはほぼ完成しているので、DLCを強く期待しています。"
29391027,Best VR experience yet
29384562,"This game is one of the better VR games I have played so far.  It works good with the Oculus and Touch controllers if you have three sensors.  If you only have two it doesn't work well, and will crash frequently.  I think there is some bug with the game when it looses tracking which causes it to start stuttering and eventually crash.  Once I added a third sensor the problem cleared up. 

The game play is good.   Inventory location was a little awkward, but not too bad.  Interface is easy and intuitive.  Graphic and visuals are nothing spectacular but that is fairly typical with most VR games.  There are no deep story lines to this game, it is pretty much a hack and slash on rails.  My only gripe with the game is that it is short.  Once I got my environment setup and running good, it only took me one 2-3 hour session to complete."
29379981,Un jeu à la Zelda comme on en rêvait. Les graphismes sont relativement simplistes (ce serait nul en 2D) mais le jeu est tellement immersif !
29372361,"This is a very nicely done elementary dungeon crawl.

Although simple enough for my kids to play, it provided slight challenges working out their puzzles at times.

Every game mechanics issue I have with dungeon crawls are still present.  Aka running back to the beginning in order to gain access to a weapons upgrade.  I mean it makes sense but just ends up being the player's waste of time in real life, which to me is more precious.

With that being said, it's a solid entry level dungeon crawl that I thoroughly enjoyed.  My son's 8 to 13 enjoyed themselves and we can't wait for episode ii to be released, hopefully through a game update as they finish this early access game."
29362488,"Dieses Spiel zeigt deutlich wie ein VR-Spiel auszusehen hat. Obwohl es sich noch in der EA-Phase befindet funktioniert es schon fehlerlos und sollte für alle frischgebackenen VIVE Besitzer der erste Punkt auf ihrer Einkaufsliste sein. Man merkt deutlich (wie auch bei der kostenlosen VIVE-Beigabe 'The gallery') daß das Spiel nur für VR entwickelt wird.
Die ganzen Mängel die andere Spiele haben, bei denen der VR-Modus nachträglich aufgepfropft wurde, tauchen hier nicht auf."
29358297,"This is by far my favorite game for the HTC Vive. The combat is great, and there are so many nooks and crannys to explore along with some puzzles. The only downside is being tall; what i meanby this is it is hard to get somew goblets and other things that involve putting your arms up. You are probably thinking it is my play space that is at fault, that is part of the truth; but i would like to see some settings that can help with these personal isssues sometime in the future."
29345260,"I've had my Vive for a little while now, and to be honest I'm a little bit disappointed in the games that are available at this moment. Most of the games I played (Job Simulator, Raw Data, H3VR, The Lab, Space Pirate Trainer) don't really feel or play like finished games, more like glorified tech demos. They're really fun for a little while, but after a few hours you get bored because you can't really sink your teeth in them. You don't get lost in their world like you would with a ""proper"" video game, like The Witcher, Tomb Raider, DOOM or Dark Souls. From all the VR games I played, Vanishing Realms feels the most like a complete game. There's a story, an art style, a world to explore, and game mechanics to master.

If you are looking for a ""real"" game in VR, this is the best one I played so far. However, I do have to say that it is kind of short. Even if you take your time to explore every nook and cranny, you'll be done in about 3 to 4 hours. I also recommend that you play on the highest difficulty setting, because it is quite easy."
29334012,"Wow this is the best VR game I've played! If you're a fan old oldschool dungeon crawlers, and appreciate an immersive game where you swing your sword with your actual arm, trying to hit the skeleton on the head over the top of its shield while also trying to dodge or block its blow - using your body instead of clicking a mouse button, then this game is a MUST TRY.
Very physical, very immersive. If only Skyrim had this..."
29329041,"You have to cooperate with the games mechanics but BEST SWORD FIGHT I EVER HAD! (Was true up until 1027, but now there are waaay better VR hand to hand fighting games, but Vanishing Realsm still has a nice Wizardry sort of puzzle solving world that let's you get used to VR controls without too much stress.)"
29325863,"One of the best games I have played on Oculus I have lots of others but this actually feels like an immersive VR game. It's great to dodge and duck behind trees scenery feels totally immersive. The graphics are ok no Witcher 3 here. However credit to the devs this is the nearest thng I have played to a real VR game. Yes other things are great  Audio shield, Elite, Space pirate trainer, holopoint to name just a few amasing games. However this seems to be a fully fledged VR game. Sad but  it's brilliant to hold a flaming torch in your hand and sword and wave them about as if they are real.  In some parts of the game the graphics are really nice, but still simplistic. Not saying they are terrible but simple still give you a huge sense of being there and I suppose thats exactly what they need to acheive. It's really exciting when you face the first enemy and have a sword battle then later to use you bow against distant enemies hiding and moving to aviod their return fire hearing the swoosh of the arrow as it narrowly misses. If you have a VR headset go buy it ! I have oculus with touch and it works perfectly. I put the censors in corners diagonal to each other and stand in the middle this way I get full room movement. much better than the two censors in front of you as when you turn around they loose your touch controllers."
29311020,"The closest thing there is to a VR Legend of Zelda title. 

VR(Vanishing Realms) includes various aspects of puzzles, exploration, and combat, and each aspect is done very well. 
On the note of combat, it has by far the best swordplay of any swordfighting VR game I've played so far, especially in hardmode. 

6 months after initial EA release, we still only have the first two chapters with little news of any updates. However, it's still worth the price. 
The game takes around 2-3 hours to beat now that the first level has been extended. It has some replay value, especially in the last ""Rite of Steel"" trial level. 

For a reasonable $20, it's definitely my favorite VR title out there."
29308391,"Greate game. This is the first VR title that has truly pulled me in to the point I forgot the real world existed. The combat is much better that the other stuff I've tried. The combat mechanics are solid, and make good use of the room scale VR. I can't wait for the next chapter."
29307429,"I am a Rift user, full room scale, but unfortunately banished ( by my wife ) to a rather smallish room for VR. 3 Sensor setup, all USB 3.0 no tracking issues, no disconnect issues. Due to the small size of my VR room I have to make smallish teleports to position myself to pick many things up… but that is my issue, not the games issue.

Ok Vanishing Realms: Impressive, truly, I am blown away by how good this is, I have not completed it yet, I am old and tire easily, can only play for 15 min or so at a time. Tracking is excellent, I have not had any of the issues others have reported. No freezes, no crashing.

Graphically the game is simply beautiful, stylized, but stays true to itself in style, it is easy to suspend disbelief and feel like you are actually there. I am past the huge skeleton with the spiked ball and chain, and have been mining for gold, trying to get enough to afford that wand ( as to how far in I am )

I would gladly have paid $20 for what I have passed already, and will jump at the opportunity to purchase more chapters if they are created. It is the little things that make it so immersive, the fact that hitting a skeleton on his Helmut, or shield does little to no damage, the fact you can parry, they way you can burn straw, or a curtain, the way small things are hidden. Easily one of my top VR experiences now, this is the kind of thing we have been wanting in VR

Hope someday for direct Touch support, but even without that, it is truly worth every penny and more.

Fantastic job
"
29296666,"This is one of the very first VR game done right from the ground up. It has set physical combats with colision detection, dodge and parying as well as a now often seen standard of inventary's management. A must have VR experience if you are a dark fantaisy adventurer."
29288516,The best VR game I've played to date.
29285878,Realy fun to play it feels like dungeons from Zelda :) Short but sweet game 3 hrs of fun worth 20$
29285350,This game really shows off the potential for VR with an RPG. A must have VR game. Warning: you'll get a LOT of exercise playing this one. I am usually sweating like after a workout from playing this game.
29281554,Currently the best VR experience I've had thus far. Graphics are awesome! Sounds are very good. Controls are easy. Lots of fun still to be had and I'm only 80 minutes in.
29281447,"This game is fulfilling my childhood dreams. I've always wanted to be able to swing a sword at a skeleton or shoot a zombie with a bow. The environments really draw you in and you're left with a lingering sense of heroism after defeating a tough opponent. Even though the developer is creating more chapters, this game is already worth more than it's priced on Steam. If you've got the Vive, you need this game."
29280456,"This game is what I had hoped for out of VR. I recently got an HTC vive and looking around at the games thought they would mostly be shooters and little fun simulations for my son. Not that I do not like shooters and the simulations, but I really enjoy adventure games. Vanishing realms is an amazing adaptation of a dungeon crawler into a perfect VR scene. It is beautiful and fun to explore and the combat is enjoyable. I really can't wait to see what they do next with it."
29271851,"Das Durchspielen hat mir sehr viel Spaß gemacht.
Besonders das erste Kapitel.
Bitte liebe Entwickler beim nächsten Kapitel wieder am ersten orientieren."
29266405,游戏里可以使用弓箭，法杖，盾牌，单手剑，单手锤，双手斧，打击感恰到好处，操作简单流畅不会头昏，游戏通关我需要三个多小时，玩完了一身汗～太好玩啦
29257543,"By far, my favorite game on the Vive so far.

Even though it is still in early access, there is a lot to this game. A classic dungeon crawler with minor puzzles and extremely fun combat! Throughout your adventure you will aquire different weapons and tools you can use to fight monsters, each one more fun to use than the last. My favorite thing about this game is when you face multiple foes using nothing but a sword and shield. Blocking and slashing has never been more exhilarating!

10/10!"
29254559,"If you like Adventure / RPG games this one is a no brainer, it is surprisingly polished for what is out there. When fighting enemies I always finished feeling quite satisfied. There is a good variety of wepons and grinding never felt so good. This is likely the closest game to a Zelda VR you will get. Now if only they will release chaper 3 already!"
29254491,"If you're a fan of Legend of Zelda or similar style games, and you've already got an HTC Vive, then you owe it to yourself to play this game. The controls are natural, and the combat is the most immersive experience that I have ever had the pleasure of playing."
29251215,"Great game. Can't recommend it enough. Had a blast playing, and it is so much fun you quickly forget the n64-like graphics.
"
29238456,"I cant recommend this enough.  One of the absolute best experiences in VR I've had.  Combat is lots of fun.  Its already longer than I thought it would be and just when I thought it was over, I'm still going.  I really hope to see more RPGs like this for VR."
29237320,"Amazing. A proper RPG, walking around,discovering things, fighting the way you like and a sense of immersion brought on by the easy inventory controls, game mechanics such as loot and puzzles and graphics that suit the current capabilities of VR without being blurred or blocky. 
Short, but I will play again. Gotta get better at those sword fights..."
29233568,"Un très bon titre, qui fait ""vrai jeu"" et non pas mini jeu (comme beaucoup de titres VR).
 Vanishing realms exploite parfaitement le casque, on est vriment plongé dans cette exploration de dongeon. Un peu court (environ 3-4h max) mais très bon !"
29217163, This is by far the best available rpg game out there right now for VR. Great game mechanics with realistic style combat . Realy had a good time playing this one and recommend it to anyone with a vive .
29199410,This is the future of gaming!!!
29189088,"Very good action game !
"
29179422,Very fun and entertaining game to play.  Just like walking around in a real midevil game.  Characters are VERY easy to beat but it's a really cool game to play.  Kind of cartoonish but the feeling of being real was there.  HIGHLY recommended
29169950,"This is hands down my favorite VR game so far, and I got my Vive on pre-order.  Truly well done.  Some minor bugs here and there, but nothing even worth mentioning.  Very immersive, runs great.  I can't say enough good things about this.

If you are at all on the fence, this is probably the only ""must have"" VR game I've played so far.  Every other game gets old pretty fast, but this one keeps me coming back.  If this game were a person, I'd hug it.  I'd love to give the developers a handshake and buy them a beer.

Cannot wait for whatever they have coming up next!"
29165831,Одна из лучших игр для HTC Vive.
29156938,"Great game, placed through the whole thing in about 3 hours, more gameplay the most non-multiplayer VR content. Gameplay is pretty good, but there isn't much re-playablility of the game since the combat is not the greatest, although I still enjoyed it. Would recommend getting this."
29154209,This game is a great single-player virtual reality experience.  The sword combat is nearly as fluid as you can get it with the way virtual reality is right now and the puzzle solving makes you feel accomplished when you find the solution.  I could not recommend this game more to anyone who has a VR headset.
29140671,"Wow....unbelievable. Leaving Early Access after years of players begging for new content and a very long period with no updates whatsoever, just to present them with payed DLC aka the rest of the game....you should be ashamed."
29140658,"Best RPG for the Vive I've played on the Vive. A must buy for Vive owners. 
Looking forward to the next chapters."
29135521,"Premise:
The epitome of what I wanted to see in a skill-based RPG in VR.  Amazing!

Graphics are crisp and well-defined.
The game itself has some puzzle elements, but nothing too complicated.  (E.G. Figure out how to get to a treasure, Find a key, figure out a riddle, etc)
Skill-based fighting 
- Melee: If your opponent swings high, you block or parry directly on their blade or duck.  Try to counter when you can see something open or just wait for the opportune time
- Ranged:  Using a bow and arrow feels really natural, there's no hiccups trying to grab the bow or nock an arrow, it's simply draw, aim and loose.  Having a ranged battle involves doing some ducking and moving or using short teleports between cover.
- Magic:  Not really implemented (at the time of this review) beyond a wand you'll have to buy during your travels.  It operates much the same as a fired explosive following an arced trajectory.
Great ambiance and fitting mood for the area you're in.
The ending really made you feel like you accomplished something.  Granted, right now there is only one chapter to the game (rite of steel), but it's a pretty long one!
Switching between weapons was a bit cumbersome at times since you have to look down at your belt while you fumble for your weapon.  In a few situations where you're surprised, that's nearly a death sentence.
Combat difficulty scaled as you play through the chapter.  Their moves became more complicated and faster with less hints at which way they would swing.  Overall it was still fairly easy if you have a shield.  Multiple enemies without a shield is pretty much a death sentence.

This is the type of game we dreamed about as kids.  I hope the next chapter is as exciting and fun!"
29135347,Best time I've had in VR.
29135134,"It's not long (2-3 hours for me) and the graphics remind me of N64, compared to other modern games, but this was still a worthwhile buy for the novel experience of hands-on dungeon crawling and well-implemented VR controls. It was quite enjoyable to physically kneel down to look under each rock for gold coins. The fighting system is fun too - not particularly deep, but wielding swords, shields, hammers, bow+arrow around with your own hands is just really cool."
29132754,"Like adventure games? Have the vive? Then go get this game, well worth the money.


well, stop reading and get it, it's the best VR game to date."
29123820,"So far so good, very polished and fun to play. It's still relatively early for VR but this game definitely demonstrates the possibilities when quality work is applied. No complaints so far and the room scale works well. Thankfully the teleportation works really well and so far I haven't been completely overwhelmed by enemies. It takes adjustment to get used to the controls as with any game. Great work so far!"
29121684,"This game is plainly the best VR experience I have had. Meele games like this are really what I am drawn to in vr with this generation of hardware and its limits. Took 3+ hours to finish the content on normal hardness. I plan to go back and play it on the hard difficulty. It is a game you need to play to see how good this generation of VR can be.  

I have a rift and touch. This game requires 360  roomscale but with 2 sensors in the opposite corners of a 7' square playspace if works pretty well for finding something to hide behind and pop out to shoot an arrow and then duck back into cover."
29107561,Just got our VIVE and Vanishing Realms blew me away.  Keep up the great work and waiting for Chapter 3!
29094358,Fantasic little game. Wish it was developed into a full length adventure. Something akin to Zelda
29072297,Amazing game! Can't wait for more!
29060541,"un jeu génial, il fait ce qu'on attend d'un RPG en réalité virtuelle, probablement le meilleur jeu auquel j'ai joué jusqu'à maintenant, un peu court cependant mais c'est une early access après tout"
29058323,"As an avid MMORPG player and a fan of the anime TV series Log Horizon and Sword Art Online, I always dreamed of immersing myself in a virtual world.  Vanishing Realms blew me away once I entered in.  Just being able to look down and see your health bar, or tossing a glass over your shoulder and hear it shatter, brings an entire fantasy world to life.  Once you experience your first taste of combat where you're parrying and blocking attacks you forget you're actually in a game and feel like a fantasy hero.  I'd definitely recommend!"
29055722,"Fantastically fun game, and my favourite on the Vive so far.  Feels like playing the old school dungeon crawl games, and is very immersive.  So many secret treasures to find, combat is quick and enjoyable, and the graphics are great."
29051186,"Well, I finished this game in just 2 and a half hours but it is very good fun. The graphics are very neat and the gameplay is quite sweet. The AI could be a bit more aggresive and I really wish you could ""kick"" their shields out of the way. But I've yet to try ""hard"" mode, so I hope that makes things a little more exciting. Worth the £15 I spent."
29046351,"This game is a massive thumbs up. Adventurous, lots of easy/moderate fighting. I can play on it for hours"
29045935,Le jeu se fige après 3 minutes d'utilisation
29045695,Stop reading reviews and buy it already!
29045314,"De momento uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en VR. Juego de tipo aventura y mazmorras. El combate con espada esta muy conseguido así como el tiro con arco. Jugado en early access, con muchas ganas de verlo acabado. Me encantaría ver un Zelda VR que utilizara las mecanicas de este juego."
29030565,"Very nice game and really funny. This game feels me like Zelda. Walking inside Dunjon, smash vases to pick up rubis, but in this game you pick up pieces of gold. Battle with Skeletons is amazing. It's remember me feeling like Link in Zelda. Searching for a Sword, Shield and Bow. :) Hope to see a new game like this Kind."
29027496,"Great Game, even at this early state. For Zelda-fans a real new experience. The fighting system is a LOT of fun! Keep it up!"
29025705,"Just finished chapters 1 & 2. Some thoughts:

Pros:
- Blocking attacks with the shield or parrying with a sword / hammer / axe is a lot of fun. You can even pretend you're Legolas and dodge arrows, which is really cool. You can also block arrows, which will stick to your shield for a while.
- Enemies are fairly varied. There are lots of variations for the standard sword & shield guys.
- The one really big boss fight towards the end is fun, and will get your blood pumping.
- You not only get melee weapons, but bows and a magic wand as well.
- You can finally mine rocks in VR :P
- You can dual wield swords, or a combination of other weapons.
- There is a 2-handed axe, which is interesting to use.

Cons:
- Swordplay is not nearly as tight as it could be. Actually landing hits on enemies can be.. Hit and miss. Their hitboxes are pretty bad, in my opinion. When you get used to it and don't flail about like an idiot though (like I tend to do) - it's not too bad.
- Maybe I just suck, but using the bow well is very hard. I'll add that I have no problems whatsoever in the archery demo in The Lab (played that one quite a bit).
- Teleportation. I personally dislike this; probably because I don't get motion sick when playing games with analog movement.
- Backtracking is a pain because of the teleportation movement system. Oh, how I wish devs would implement alternative control schemes. The touch pads on the Vive controllers would be just fine for moving forwards and back. The Oculus Touch controllers are probably even better for this.

Summary (TLDR):
If you like RPG's and have a VR headset, you should probably buy this. It's worth the asking price, even though it's a short game. If you have patient friends, you can even demo this to them - and they'll probably love it. It has its fair share of problems, but these are easy to look past. I'd give this one a 7,5/10."
29025321,"Great game, but very short and there seems to be something missing, I can't quite explain what exactly it is.  There's just this sense of I feel like I'm forcing myself to play, its not a must have but its for sure a fun experience."
29025062,WOWZERS! A must have VR game!! Your future you who has already played the game has asked me to write a review so you would get it sooner! OH yeah make sure you have min space of 2x2. AMAZING GAME!  Remember that first time you played Zelda.. This is waaay better!
29018185,THE BEST VR GAME AVAILABLE
29018183,If you love RPGs you'll love this game. THE END!!! BUY IT! DO IT! JUST DO IT!!!!!
29012833,Best VR game I've played.  Can't wait for new content.
28995692,"Just got thru playing it and WOW. That is one of the best VR games I have played yet. Its long enough for it to be completly worth it and just short enough for you to not get tired of it and want more. The story is captavating and the combat is exiting.

 If the devs read this, Really good job guys. This is a truly good game. Two thumbs up for a game that i could not put down. If I could as per request highs, lows and bugs

Highs: Smooth gameplay and graphics, Excellent use of money to buy swords, bows, and magic, A likeable story with a hint of mystery. (not all the highs but just wanted to be concise.)

Lows: Limited to one type of magic, HUD is kinda wonky with the moving as you turn your head ( found it difficult to put things in my pocket), no way to cancel spell from wand ( killed myself a few times trying to put it back in my pocket lol), and if at all possible can you make the shields of the enemys breakable ( have low tear guys have very easly broken shields and higher end guys more difficult to break.)

Bugs: Im not a games des or dev so im not sure what to look for in the realm of ""bugs"" maybe a couple of clipping issues buts thats all i got.

OK thanks for reading really hope ive helped with this if at all. Again great game, great job and hope to see more from you really soon."
28989120,"I eagerly await any DLC this developer will throw at me.  The controls were well thought-out and intuitive.  The graphics were exactly what I expected from a game of this type, but still fit well.  The sword combat was deeper than a lot of games I've played already on Vive, and I hope it continues to evolve, because its a blast!  My only complaint, like so many other awesome games on Vive, is that it was a bit short, despite having spent several hours beating it.  Time to go back for hard mode!"
28984807,"Great game! I did get invested in the game and played it non-stop, although it is a short game. You really feel a sence of accomplishment after each fight. Defenitly something to try if you own a VR-machine :D"
28983706,"If you are looking for a game where you explore a unique dungeon with great sword and board gameplay and other weapons, go for Vanishing Realms. Currently there isn't any game out there right now that achieves both very well except for this game. Don't rush through the game, try to explore all the nooks and crannies of the game, especially what is above you.

If you feel like the game is too easy, start the game on hard mode and be prepared to change up the way how you play."
28973224,"I love this game. Sure it has a few quirks, but the way it presents the world through the goggles is magnificent. Swordfighting with skeletons, trading arrows with archers, and flinging fireballs at the baddies completes the experience of wondering through this virtual world. Just remember to look up sometimes!

If you have a VR rig and are a fan of high fantasy, I highly recommend this game."

28968522,"First review I've done on steam, only played around an hour and a half but honestly, this game is what the Vive and VR was made for, It feels like you're in a seperate world and have to fight and use your wits to stay alive. My first encounter with an enemy gave me real fear, I had nothing except an apple, and tried to fight. Bad Idea. I'd highly reccomend this game to anyone."
28966450,"It's Zelda in VR, Definatly worth the $$$, I had a PSVR, now the HTC VIVE, so glad i made the switch! This is a must buy!"
28966152,Well worth the money - can't wait to see more as this title develops.
28964936,"At first, I thought the cartoonish style of Vanishing Realms would take away from the immersive experience I hoped it would be, but I was mistaken. Although it is not the most visually stunning VR title out there, it more than makes up for it with gameplay and battle mechanics.  When an enemy is defeated, there is a firm sense of accomplishment.  

The inventory system is intuitive.  The overall feel of the game is actually quite polished once you get past the more basic graphic quality.  The gameplay is very smooth, perhaps because of the simplified textures.

Vanishing Realms is definately one of the best VR titles to date.  I definately look forward to more content."
28964096,"After playing this game for several hours my roommate found me crawling around on the floor, wildly waving my arms about and generally making a fool of myself. This isn't a game of masterful storytelling and the monsters are cartoonish but it provides me with enough to make me love it. First is the gameplay mechanics; shooting arrows and dodging fireballs is outrageously fun and generally just makes me giddy. Second is the beautiful scenery, particularly outside; I've often just stood and looked around. These elements together make for an absorbing experience that sucks my time and occasionally even have me dropping the controller on the ground as I set it down on one of the virtual tables.
I just wish the monsters were scarier!"
28960921,"I really enjoyed playing this game. I strongly recomend wariors challenge (hard mode) if you can handle it, as it means that you can't just shake your controller wildy to defeat enemies.

The game unfortunately starts a little slowly. It can be very imersive.  I highly recomend it."
28956023,Definitely pretty amazing. Hungry for more content.
28955245,"I have to admit it. It's the RPG/Adventure genre that sold me the Vive. The thought of being in a dank dark dungeon in VR was just too compelling to ignore. If Vanishing Realms is just a taster of what's to come, then I was right to be an early adopter with the vive. The game is a joy to play and I find myself get so lost in it's atmosphere. Kudos to the devs for making such a fabulous experience. Buy it now if you know what's good for you. A few jump scares, fun combat and some nice puzzles too. Your vive was built for stuff like this.  Love it, 10/10"
28954661,"Ce jeu est vraiment excellent, simplement la meilleure expérience VR pour moi.

Les textures et la modélisation sont simples mais personellement j'aime beaucoup, car beaucoup de détails viennent se rajouter, comme des feuilles mortes, de la brume, des petits moucherons autour des lumières, rayons a travers les fenêtres ou trous dans certaines grottes, tout cela rend le jeu très immersif, j'ai même été jusqu'a m'assoir sous un arbre, a coté de champignons géants, a écouter le son d'ambiance et regarder les étoiles.

- Inventaire très bien realisé
- Sound design, game design et ambiances excellentes
- Background simpathique

J'espère vraiment qu'une suite sortira, il semblerait que ce soit le cas, car c'est vraiment la ou j'attend la VR !"
28950683,"Vanishing Reamls is really awesome, its like you ARE in this world ( and reminds me @ Zelda ). I mean we are only at the beginning of VR and this is a good game to show people what VR really is."
28949032,VR界裡初期數一數二的RPG，物品攔貼心的設計成無限容量的四次元百寶袋。
28945485,.
28944741,"One of the best VR games I've run across. I wasn't sure I was going to like it since there's very little gameplay video and all screen shots (that tends to worry me) but I ended up playing the entire game on my first session. The monsters are appropriately menacing and big yet still retain a game feel. The puzzles aren't hard (at least to me) but I didn't want to play an escape room game. The developers have achieved a good balance of fight and puzzle to keep you moving through the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who just received a VR rig. Get it, play it, show it to your friends.

Peace"
28943016,A must play Zelda-esque dungeon crawler.
28930807,Need more torches
28921150,Fantastic RPG for VR. One of my favorite games on VR so far. Can't wait for episode 3!
28919403,"There arent many games I've enjoyed as much as this one, it looks great, feels great and the exploration is a lot of fun. It's pretty short, as goes for all VR games atm, and that would be my only complaint. I know it seems like a lot to ask, but I'd LOVE to see this game explode into something huge, with at least 60 hrs or more worth of content. That being said, it is still well worth the 20$ as is."
28919358,"Very good time in VR. 
The games does not require a very powerfull hardware (GTX970 is enough here). 

Of course, more content would be welcome as noticed by other gamers. A little bit more of storytelling would be interesting too. 
Nevertheless this is possibly one of the best current VR games. I will buy the DLC with the next chapters when available.  

Small suggestions : 
- Damages could take into account the speed (and/or the deceleration) when hitting an opponent
- When game is completed it would be cool to have a direct access to the final fight with some difficulty setting (as random new opponents, no sales items, extra HP for monsters, ...)
- More spells !"
28913109,"From someone than bought this game just at launch, and was disappointed from lenght and difficulty, I've changed my mind. I replayed the game today, after lot of months, and well it's a very different experience. The hard difficulty is the game changer, it was incredibly easy before and enemies super easy to beat, ruining almost the whole game (do yourself a favour, if you're buying the game and you aren't a total noob with videogames start the campaign at hard).

One of best games for VR, maybe not the most spectacular but do many things wonderfully (inventory, fighting, teleporting) being user friendly and deep at the same time."
28911659,"From the moment you start the game to how intuitive the ""interface"" is, this game is both beautiful, immersive, fun and awesome.  If you wanted to experience an adventure, solve puzzles and fight monsters, this is the game for you.

Sound/Graphics:
To me, I love the style and how everything in the game looks.  They style is kind of cartoony and it works really well for this game.  There is a ""level"" or area inside of a crypt that is flooded and from the water dripping to the echos of distant noises plus the need to use a torch to help with the darkness, this game really hits the mark.  In areas where you are exploring outside, you can hear the crickets chirp whil looking at the dark moon light things up.  It is a beautifully well done game and an amazing VR experience

Interface:
The developer really hit a home run on this one.  From the moment I jump inot the game, everything is very intuitive and self explainitory.  There is a tutorial level to get you going for new users but I would love to see this type of interfacing as the norm for adventure games.  Pulling items from your inventory, dropping and movement is extremely simple and really helps you to forget that you are in a game.  The simplicity really helps with immersion combined with the sound and the graphics, I really felt like I was in this world, even after taking off the VR headset.  Well done!

Gameplay:
I have read people compare this to Zelda type games, which is one way to describe it.  the way I see it is, if you took an old school point and click adventurgame like Lucas Arts or the old Sierra games, converted it to a 3D VR space and added additional elements of combat, this is Vanishing Realms.  It was so fun to play (I spent about 3 hours from start to finish trying to explore every nook and cranny) there are so many ""hidden"" things to do in this game from looking in the hollow part of a log to find treasure to solving riddles and finding solutions to progress to other areas.  This aspect is very immersive and fun.  I caint wait to see more from this game and I hope other adventrue games follow suit with Vanishing Realms

Combat:
Combat is split into two categories, melee and ranged and I must say, I was pretty impressed by the combat and the AI.  In melee, you may get a few hits in if you start randomly swinging at a monster, but they block, set back and move out of your way so you can't use that as a go to strategy.  The different monsters do have patterns and once you figure it out (by watching how they hold their sword, and if you react quick enough, you can easily defeat the monsters.  It takes time to learn this, makinc one on one combat a joy... that leads to much more challenging scenarios when you face multiple opponents at the same time.  You really need to look and block and move and avoid being surrounded in order to win otherwise they will chop you up like diced tomatoes ;) this is where you need group based combat strategies... i.e. move arround your opponents and do not get surrounded... you can also use other enemies to help kill each other.  I was fighing a Giant skeleton, who has a ball and chain type weapon with a few other skeleton creatures facing me.  I would manuver myself between a smaller skeleton and the swining ball and chain from the giant one, and have him crush my opponents for me. It was fun and you have to try it :) you can also pick between dual wield, sword and shield and two handed weapons, which really change up how you play and works great in different scenarios.

Ranged combat is well though out and I really felt like I was pulling back on a bow.  If you try to shoot monsters from a distance, they will move or block and, while you have unlimited arrows, it can be pretty challenging to bring a creature down that is protected and is moving out of your way.  Using the terrain around you to protect from incoming projectiles was another fun and tactical way to deal with enemies from a distance that were shooting back at you.  I know I spent more time on melee combat but doing things like shooting apples from a tree, cutting wires with my arrows to give me access to a bridge or shooting pesky mage ghosts as fireballs streak past me... this was insanley fun.

Over all:
Get this game, you will not be disappointed :)

28906522,這是目前玩過最好的VR冒險類遊戲，買了絕不會後悔
28900473,"Amazing game, one of the best VR experiences."
28895533,"Great example of what future RPGs can build upon for VR. Took me about 2.3 hours to complete on Classic difficulty, and I fully expect to go back and play it again on Hard once it is out of Early Access and Steam Achievements are implemented.

Pros:
- Enemies will learn as you fight them. Hit an enemy swordsman 2-3 times with your bow and arrow, and they will make sure to dodge/parry the next time you shoot at them, forcing you to change strategy and fight them differently. 
- Higher difficulty enemies will utilize chain attacks and attempt to strike you in your week spots, keeping you on your toes and parrying between strikes.
- Great variety of environments to explore.
- Progressive introduction of new weapons/enemies.

Cons:
- $20 for a 2-3 hour game is a bit high. However I can understand that until VR becomes more mainstream, this is needed to offset development cost. Fortunately, I was able to buy this on sale."
28894383,I have not played yet but the two that have Rave about it. Maybe they will let me play soon.
28893184,"Good intro into what VR can do, worked up a sweat whilst playing and forgot that I was in the game at times walking away from edges to stop falling off! Worth the cash but could do with a couple more chapters with different techniques required to complete. Struggled with the 2 handed weapon controls rest were intuative."
28888043,Awesome game... I am looking forward to more.  :)
28886870,"This is simply one of the best and most immersive VR games available. If you like RPGs, this is definately for you!"
28881292,"A word about my setup. I have a modest setup... nothing crazy:  i5 6600k slighty overclocked with watercooling and 16GBs of RAM, a GeForce 970 video card. I've been playing this with Oculus Rift with just two sensors and ""Room Scale"" settings in Steam VR with little to no problems. One sensor on the desk and one sensor off to the side. I would set them farther apart, but the Oculus softare complains about them needing to be 3-6 feet apart when I try that. My total playing space is about 5 feet by 7 feet and it has been plenty of room for this and all of the ""Room Scale"" VR games I have tried. 

But anyways... I digress... the game plays wonderfully with only the occasional tracking hickup with only the two Oculus sensors and ""autopause"" turned off. It gives you that classic Zelda feel but in virtual space. I love it. Really engrossing and extremly immersive. Fantastic. I hope to see more games like this."
28874631,"Absolutely an amazing game!  The fighting is really fun, as well as the bow and arrow shootouts.  I have been waiting to see how game designers would incorporate 1st person travelling with a VR play space, and this game makes moving and fighting very easy with an HTC Vive.  Great work Indimo Labs!"
28867385,"After a 43 minute session of Vanishing Realms featuring enough sweat on my brow to make Andrew Ryan envious, I went to the bathroom to clean myself. I stopped for a while and caught myself trying to teleport closer to the towels."
28863535,Paid for early access and need to pay again to see the released version?  Darkness washed over the dude...
28861877,"Fantastic game! Probably the best VR RPG to date.

I experienced some glitches here and there like losing a motion controller at the edge of the play area but a quick reset always fixed it. A couple of items(torch and pickaxe) just disappeared when placing them in my bag but again, very minor. It is worth it after playing some terrible VR RPGs and for under $14 it can't be beat. Only other thing I'd say negatively is the resolution but that's VR wide, mostly. We'll get there and it'll be amazing!

I can not wait for Chapter 3 and many more!"
28861799,"It's one of the most fun RPGs out here! Not to mention you actually need skills to block, parry, and attack the enemies!

I highly recommend anyone who loves skyrim, to try this out!


Cons:

Puzzles a little too simple
Not enough enemy diversity"
28856929,"Amazing game!  I played it on the Rift and had no problems, worth every penny I spent on it. Ok, now stop reading this review and buy the game already."
28851906,"This is by far the best virtual reality game I've played so far. Not only does it feel like a full game. It's designed well, it plays awesome, it looks great. I was totally into it. This game proved VR for me. AMAZING!"
28851173,"One of the absolute best for room-scale VR.

Adding random loot drops (damage +4, vampiric health recovery, magic resistance, etc.) would be extraordinary.

I also wish you could replay the Trials stage and accumulate gold instead of resetting every time.  It would let people stockpile and sharpen their skills for chapter 3 and beyond.  Hopefully, that is coming along... please release it and take my money!"
28849335,"Excellent game. Great story, fun combat, good visuals. Would recommend to anyone."
28844792,"best VR fantasy RPG , veeery fun swordplay but overall not so inspired gameplay/graphics"
28841838,"This was the second VR game I had purchased after Space Pirate Simulator, and was one of the better first forays into the RPG adventure side of things (the other one being Spell Fighter, a clunky free vr game)

What did I like:

The art style visually pleasing and doesn't get in your face.

Sword and shield mechanics feel fluid, but with some issues (see below)

Archery was clean, for the most part, but also had some issues (see below)

Most of the environment is interactable. There's a section in game where there were a number of ore clusters around, and I was wondering if I would be able to mind them later on. Sure enough, a few areas later I found a few pickaxes.

Puzzles were challenging, but didn't make me want to take the headset off and quit.


What I didn't like:

Presently in game, there's an auto-pause feature. This may have been more of an issue with my cobbled settup, but I was experiencing the auto-pause going off a lot during combat and exploration, despite me not going out of sight of my base stations. I tried turning it off, but whenever I did go out of range of my base stations I got pwnt by the enemies.

Combat is good for the most part, but hit detection needs a lot of work. I managed to complete both chapters, but not without combat grinding to a halt because of auto-pauses, or constantly having to flail and reposition due to the auto-pause throwing my character out of position, and rendering me unable to hit anything.

Call me a noob, but I was having extreme issues with archery at long range. There's a section where you need to fight a skeleton wizard, a skeleton cleric, and a skeleton juggernaught. Attacking the fire wizard or the juggernaut doesn't work because the cleric  heals them. Trying to dodge fireballs and hit the cleric repetedly was almost impossible due to how archery works. I wish there was a proper sight on the bow, or at least something to assist with aim.

Later on in game you have the opertunity to gain a two-handed axe as a weapon. While it deals good damage, I found myself going back to my battleworn sword that was dealing less damage due to the outright clunkyness of the mechanics. Again, this may have been an issue with my settup rather than a game issue.

Inventory management for weapons was something that I almost tore my hair out at. Trying to swap from sword to axe, or vice versa, was a trial in patience, since if you click on the axe with your sword equiped, it causes them to stack rather than swap. I ended up getting hit a lot because I was trying to swap to my sword, and ended up stacking it on top of the axe, leaving my unarmed in my main hand, rather than swapping to the proper weapon.



All in all, Vanishing Realms is a good game, but it does suffer from issues that can be solved with a bit more polish, and a bit more work setting up your play area.
"
28840928,"This has been my favorite VR game to play so far. The ambiance in the game makes you feel like you're really alone in a dark magic world. A big part of that feeling comes from the ambient noises and music. Deep rumbling, droning noises, and occasionally noises from monsters in rooms nearby as you creep around. It's not a horror game but it will make you jump sometimes as a skeleton pops out of something unexpectedly.

The combat in the game is fun even though getting used to teleporting in combat is a little weird at first. I especially liked the enemy arhcers because it was unnerving seeing their arrows flying right at your face. I liked the rush as your instinct kicked in to prevent you from getting an arrow shot through your face because your brain didn't know it was only VR. I would have liked the enemies to be a bit more agressive in chasing me. I haven't tried the hard mode yet, maybe they do then?

Mining wasn't something I was expecting to see in this game but was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of future potential here. Resource gathering and crafting would be cool. Another interesting concept to see in VR was the destroyable object: burning or smashing things to find hidden items. Lastly, some items were in plain sight but required solving a puzzle or finding a clever way to knock it down. I found myself picking up candles and throwing them at the ceiling knocking down goblets. Lots of fun.

Looking forward to new expanded content soon."
28840006,"Pretty fun game, was one of my first for the VR and really drew me in. Would reccomend to anyone with a VR and a passion for swords/shields/ fantasy type gaming."
28834680,"Really fun adventure style game with a nice mix of action, exploration, and puzzles to solve. Only complaint is I wish it was longer. Looking forward to the next chapters!"
28834221,"Awesome RPG for your VR kit. Sword fighting and archery feels astonishingly real. Face golems, skeletons, goblins and more enemies in a beautiful VR world. This one is definitely a must-have."

When I got to obtaining the bow it was a total ""oh F*ck yea!!"", and then I reached the fire wand and was just giddy with stupidness. This game rocks, hopefully the developers either create DLC/expansions/addons/content to keep it going."

28816417,Best single player experience on the vive yet.  Can't wait for more content
28815795,"This game was by far the best VR game i've played to date. The story isn't really gripping, it's more for the fighting and while it's combat system is a little simple it's really fun for anyone who doesnt  want to spend 2 years mastering sword techniques. You can take my word and everyone elses that this game is amazing. Just buy it."

28807526,"
The Melee in this game is terribler there is no reason to even try it easier to exploit  than the Wii. Also im 6 foot and this game will have you constenly staring at the ground . I would not recomend this game if your 6 foot  i found it easier to melee when i was on my knees. I also skipped a large portion of this game and had to back track I actually found this easier than actual trying to navigate their story. I also end up punching my ceiling when trying to get Goblets off of the wood planks in game. So I just avoided trying to get those items. The enemys also get to close when your fighting you constently find yourself walking backwards ."
28802188,完美的GAME
28799258,Awesome game where you really feel accomplished after each fight.
28794567,Highly recommend plaing this if you have a vive. Went through the game as is in about a day and got a good workout as a result. Looking forward to the next chapter but for now I'm going to collapse in a heap. Someone pass me a healing potion will ya!
28787652,Amazing game. So far the most immersive experience I have had in VR. 100% purchase for me.
28787096,"Ok I've got 50+ VR games and this is on my Top 4 best experiences yet !
RoomScale use is very very clever, makes it very hard to actually cross the boundaries I hope most games can replicate this behaviour ! I can walk around without fear of hitting my walls.
And overall the game is very well paced, has some actual game mechanics and uses lore in clever ways to make you actually live the experience. Combat actually feels good. And exploration is well rewarded !
I've got 90mn in the adventure and I already feel like there will be good replay value.

Yes this is one of the VR games you can actually buy without after thoughts."
28756682,"Put simply, this is a truly amazing and super fun game for VR.

I won't comment on the full content, as to me this is part of the experience while playing this game which represents the most you can expect. And that's the first and only negative aspect I see for this game: The overall play time you'll get for paying 20€. The first playthrough (Nearly non-stop, I just had to sleep and eat something on occasion..) provided me with nearly 4 hours of fun. A few euros less and you'll get a very polished and well made game for your bucks. Since I got this game during Steam's Winter Sale it cost me 14€ which looks like a reasonal price to me. But this is nitpicking. Paying more than that just helps the developer to provide us with a third chapter.

And this what I'm looking for. The third chapter. Or put simply, again, MOOAR content!

- I want to smash bigger and more challenging creatures (Though, I have yet to play this game on ""Hard"" and fighting against multiple opponents IS already challenging!).
- I want more stories which evolve the same way as the one from the first chapter. (And please, again using rimes which match the atmosphere so well!)
- I want more (bigger?) items to throw around, maybe even ones you can utilize in combat. (Throwing a bottle at the enemy and then set him on fire using a torch...)
- I want more magic. One wand is not enough. (Though there's magic, after all!)

For those who still hesitate:

- You really need the required play space. I played the game on a 3.2mx1.7m space and if I had not only a couch which limits me to 1.7m but a solid wall I guess I already had to buy a new motion controller after the first fight. If not after the first 1 vs 1, then definitely after the first 1 vs 2 engagement.
- The graphics are not what you'll see in the usual games today. It's rather a more modern Spyro or any similar jump'n'run from the past, graphic wise. But it's not the graphics what makes truly great games great! And that's even more the fact for this game.
- The teleportation system works very well. It's not like in other games or ""demos"" and limits you how far you can teleport in a nice way. I can't properly describe it, but it just works and does not feel that different than using your own feet. And since the required play space is already fairly big, you'll have enough chances to use your own feet nonetheless.
- It's VR. Put simply. ;-)

I can't await chapter three, four, five, ......"
28755143,I've played almost every major title there is for VR. This game is the definitive experience.
28752496,"HTC Vive 

Che c'é di meglio di stare in un Dungeon, con nemici armati di spade, scudi, palle chiodate, maghi, arcieri e tanto altro.
Ci sono boss ed enigmi, armi di ogni genere, non credo ci sia di meglio per adesso.
Se siete amanti del genere e volete un bel gioco con buona grafica e giocabilità, vi consiglio di giocarci, non rimarrete delusi.
Grafica ''Cartonesca'' ma godibilissima.
"
28744862,Much better than expected. Enjoyable progression through increasingly better gear and more challenging enemies.
28736449,"I've been on Steam since it began and in all that time I don't think I've written a single review.  I probably should have for a few games but this one basically compelled me to write one. 

THIS GAME IS FREEKING AMAZING.  

Its what anyone who has been dreaming about VR gaming could hope for in a VR game.  

If this were a normal game it would be a very forgettable dungeon crawler several years out of date.  Its not though, its a true VR game with a excellent interface, responsive controls, puzzles which are not very hard but very interesting in VR, and the fact I can have a real sword fight with a armored skeleton is fantastic.  I was surprised I even had to properly swing to get a two handed axe to work right and I'm blocking with the shaft intuitively.  

I also learned a valuable lesson.  Unlike a regular game, its totally not worth picking up every gold coin on the ground and smashing EVERY pot or box.  I only just quit playing because after several fights with the 2h axe, I was getting a bit sweaty, and I'm not an out of shape gamer. 

Basically if you own a Vive, you MUST get this.  I'm not sure why it didn't show up for me in a VR search on steam, (found it via google), this should be shipped with the Vive as a package its so good.

Side note, my room is pretty small, the Vive minimum, and I'm under the recommended size for this game but the games UI is good enough that its never been an issue. 

If I could make one small suggestion, I would allow for drawing/sheathing motions from the back and hip for swords, bows, etc.  

Anyways GET THIS GAME. 
"
28730947,Awesome game.  Makes me wish there were more chapters to purchase.  Great workout to boot!
28729611,"Immersive and fun dungeon crawler with great visuals and sound, entertainging combat and challenging puzzles. Exactly what I hoped to play in VR. Congrats to the creator and please keep developing this game."
28729223,"So much fun.  One of the very best games for VR.  You get to go into a dungeon, fight skeletons, find loot, the whole deal.  Object interactions are fun.  BUY IT!"
28728107,"Amazaing VR game. You get to dual wield swords, snipe enemies from the cover of a tree, collect treasure obsessively (spent 1 hour throwing rocks at an out-of-reach chalice) and manage your resources to upgrade your gear etc."
28722067,"When I show off my Vive to friends, this is the game everything else leads up to. 

Vanishing Realms is the single best VR game available today. It's got everything I want in a VR game: room-scale support, great visuals, realistic sound, melee combat, ranged combat, strategy, unique environments, and so much more. 

The combat moments are intense, but not scary. I love that there are hidden objects all over the world. And the pacing is just right. 

I was pretty methodical with my gameplay, and found that it took about 4-5 hours to complete the game. 

For anyone who has wanted Skyrim in VR, this is the closest we've got."
28715864,"This is the first VR game I played that felt like I was really ""there."" No story, just a series of challenges as you move throughout a dungeon and outdoor world. I stayed up until 4:00a playing as I just couldn't leave. Very immersive! I'm hoping for more levels and challenges in the final build. I liked it so much I bought it as a Christmas present for a new Vive owner. 

I'm not a fan of fantasy, but I'm glad I bought this game!"
28713328,"Played this with Oculus rift + Touch. 
I would say this is the most fun and immersive game i've played in VR, would recommend it to anyone.
Combat is simple but really makes you feel like you're battling with something big in front of you.
I have a smaller than recommended play space and have found myself accidentally bashing into a wall or something when i was getting too into it, haha.
10/10 would punch wall while trying to kill a skeleton again."
28688682,"Closest thing to first person VR Zelda out right now! Totally loving it. 
Only complaint is I currently only have a 180 sensor setup (Oculus Rift w/2 cameras), and there seems to be no way in game to rotate your character other than physically turning. Throw a 90 degree snap-turn on the touchpad/thumbsticks and it'd be perfect!"
28683637,Finally a true RPG made for VR !!! One on my favorite game on VR.
28665811,"Genial !! , les combats sont super realiste ! parer les coup et les donner n a jamais ete aussi jouissif !!

"
28656624,Fun game.  Looking forward to the next chapter.
28653684,"This game is incredible!  I play it in part as a workout and in part for the game.  The story is lacking, ut all things considered that doesn't actually bother me.  I love that it isn't *just* hack and slash, but that you also can't progress without using the weapons.  I collected every weapon and lost chalice just to enjoy learning the mechanics of each and get achievements.  The second part has significantly less content than the first part does, but each chapter is conatined appropriately.  I am really looking forward to chapter 3!"
28649374,"wow, just wow, get it, thats all."
28641363,Very fun game!
28639850,"Perfect RPG game for Vive, with full story and not a wave-after-wave typical setup that you see all the time in VR games. Very interesting environmental interaction too."
28638847,"Fantastic game and beautiful world.
Hope it expands, got through it kinda quick.
But loved every minute of it!"
28628137,"Awesome game! Games like this makes it worth buying a VR system.
There is so much crap out there but this game really shines.
I cant wait for more content / chapters."
28621876,"A great example of what VR games should strive to become. 
A completely immersive world. I felt like I was truely a warrior traversing through a dungeon. I loved the sense of exploration, looting, surviving, and accomplihment this game provides. I never had a dull moment, by far the best game on VR to date. The delevolper has and is adding additonal free content down the road so you definitely get your money's worth and have something to look forward to."
28616691,"One of, if not THE, best VR game I have played to date.  The combat seems simplistic at first, but is the perfect pace given the control scheme and generally clunkiness of current VR tech.  As with most VR games the kernel of something better is here and I hope this becomes a template for future games.  Unlike most VR games, this one doesn't rely on gimmicks.  It feels like a super simplistic dungeon crawl game, that on a normal PC interface would get 1 out of 10 stars, but modified controls to VR and it's easily 9 out of 10.  Nothing gets 10 out of 10 unless it cooks me dinner.

I don't like the angle the shield is held at, but I got used to it fast enough, and the combat is fluid without worrying about punching my desk if I get too close to the room boundaries.  Is there much replay value?  Probably not.  Is this the game to introduce people to VR with?  Definitely not, given the very slow learning (thankful for it) curve at the start.  But it's definitely one of those good intermediate experiences."
28615678,"My first few days with the VIVE.  This has been my first experience with what felt like a virtual fantasy world - loved it and finished it pretty qickly (4.5 hrs)

I searched crates and mined ""for real""
I sat down and rested by the water looking at the enviroment wishing I could infact put my feet in.

simple, but a great cohesive feel to the who experience.

28602677,The graphics may look simple on a monitor. But in VR this game is immersive fun and engaging.

알피지 게임을 좋아하는데 재밌게 플레이중입니다.일단 멀미는 없고 이동은 텔레포트 형식으로 진행되며 타이밍 맞춰서 칼을 튕겨내거나 방패, 활 등을 활용해 퍼즐이나 몬스터를 사냥하는게 재미있습니다.

28600088,"If you like fantasy with swords, bows and magic, this game if for you!  Very fun, but not enough content for the price.  took me 2.5 hours to beat."
28591311,"Excellent VR game for the Vive.  This is what I imagined VR could be like. Very immersive with an excellent control and inventory system.  Wielding swords, axes and bow gives You  a bit of a workout too. Just make sure you stay centred in your play area when fighting or you will end up smacking a real wall with your controller.  Definitely recommend this for Vive owners,"
28564101,Great dungeon delve! Finally something other than a wave shooter. :)
28557452,"Ce jeux est tout simplement la meilleure expérience VR que j'ai vécu jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Un gameplay riche et époustoufflant. Il colle parfaitement au principe de la VR !
Il faut vraiment le coup !
C'estg exactement ZElda mais en VR. Juste génial !"
28540471,"I was concerned that this would be another glorified tech demo, as these early VR games often are, but far from it. This is a great game, and starting to show the twinklings of what VR games could offer in the future. Room for improvement? Yes. Time and money well spent? Definitely.

(constructive) criticism: 

1) The checkpoint system is not entirely intuitive. I left a chest to come back to later, and it was gone when I returned (apparently because my progress marked that section as 'cleared' in the save or something?)  It was never quite clear what would be saved and what wouldn't.

Ideally I'd like to be able to save whenever I want (VR sessions in particular often need to be much shorted than 'normal' PC gaming).

2) Items were not where I left them in bags when I restarted. A small issue, but would prefer if things stayed in the bag slot where I left them.

Keep up the good work!"
28539876,"This is my favorite VR game. A lot of games are fun and let you do neat things but this game really taps in to something that I have always wanted to do. Holding a torch in one hand and a sword in the other while exploring dark dungeons, solving puzzles, and fighting monsters. Its a dream come true.  If you like Zelda games this is pretty similar for VR."
28518999,"well worth the 20bucks I spent on it. Its only a few hours long, but it feels much longer than that. Especially if you try and 100% it."
28504722,"This is such an awesome game. Please please please add more chapters. I am currently playing warrior mode. The swordplay is good and for a D&D player it is very cool to expierence a ""real"" swordfight. The movement by teleportation is nicely done, better than in other games. This is my favorite game, everything about it. 

Bibi (wife of JeroenWarmerdam)"
28479023,"TL:DR - Its a enjoyable VR title that will suck you in you for 2hrs if you're willing to pay £7.50/hr to do something you enjoy then why not try this.

I have time to read - A really good game. I wish I had played it before Arizona Sunshine, then I would have rated it as an excellent game. Playtime approx 2hrs and I don't think I missed much (got all the chalices and shot half the apples off the trees)

Although the gfx are cartoon there is a lot of good stuff in this game. Looting, Mining and setting fire to just about everything that looks like it will burn. The story is good and well thought out and the devs have turned a dungeon crawl into something compelling to play for 2hrs. The AI is not completely stupid as in other sword fighing titles. They back off, have a variety of attacks, dodge arrows and even push you back if you get too close (Bone Hulk). So all in all, good. As for the fighting, be careful you don't need to swing wildly and well timed, aimed strikes will enable you to take out your opponents quicker and with ease. The bow/arrow are good and the collision detection is excellent. The two handed poleaxe is... well, a little unwieldy as you would expect a 2H poleaxe. If you keep good distance its fine, but lacks the precision of the sword.

I would like to see the devs expand this to include some spellcraft (casting runes in order to throw magic) and maybe multiplayer co-op.

* SPOILER ALERT BELOW *




The only down side I found was that, as a cautious fighter, I entered most large areas with caution, the mobs spawn and I can then pepper them with arrows from range and they didn't advance on me. In the show down with the king I took out all the mobs and half the kings health from just inside the door way with my bow/wand. Note to devs: Maybe don't allow me unlimited arrows. Put a quiver size of 50 arrows and allow me to collect from fallen enemies. That way I have to be more tactical in my engagement with the mobs.

Also the wand is OP it is basically a RPG (Note: The only time I died in the game was when I blew myself up with the wand)."
28477952,"VR Review für die HTC-Vive

Nun muss ich doch einmal sagen: Ich habe mich in mein erstes VR-Spiel verliebt. Wegen der Hoffnung auf solche Spiele habe ich mir eine VR-Brille zugelegt. 

Hier werden die Möglichkeiten von VR in tollen Situationen aufzeigt, an welche ich noch immer zurückdenken muss. Z.B. wenn man sich zum ersten mal bei einem PC Spiel dabei ertappt, wie man sich auf den Boden legt, um durch tödliche Fallen hindurchzurobben und einen Schatz zu bergen oder sich kurz aus der Deckung herauswagt, seinen gespannten Pfeil abfeuert und wieder hinter der Ecke versteckt. 
Bei schwereren Gegnern kommt man tatsächlich außer Puste und turnt wie ein Irrer durch das Wohnzimmer, um Schlägen auszuweichen und eigene zu platzieren. 
Das alles ist eingebettet in eine handgebaute wundervoll atmosphärisch düstere Welt, welche sowohl Innen- als auch Außenareale bietet, die  liebevoll gestaltet wurden und erst durch das Roomscaling richtig zum Leben erwachen. Die Grafik ist hübsch anzusehen und wirkt sehr immersiv. 
Im Kampf gegen die verschiedenen Gegnerarten hat man unterschiedliche Waffen, welche man nach und nach gegen gesammeltes Gold eintauschen kann, das an den unterschiedlichsten Orten versteckt ist in Form von Münzen, Pokalen und Edelsteinen. 
Gesteuert wird das Ganze mit den Vive-Controllern, wobei jeder Controller einen Arm darstellt, sodass man beispielsweise Schwert und Schild halten kann, oder eben beispielsweise einen beidhändigen Bogen. 
Wenn man es sich einfach machen will, dann kann man Gegner recht mühelos mit dem Bogen ausschalten, da die Gegner eine schlechte Wegfindung haben und sich quasi überhaupt nicht an den Spieler annähern. Daher entwickelt das Spiel seine wirkliche Stärke im Nahkampfsystem, wenn man Gegner mit dem Schild oder Schwert pariert und dann zum Gegenangriff auf ungeschützte Stellen ausholt, oder den Gegner umtänzelt und von der Seite angreift. Die Gegner greifen zur Zeit relativ langsam an, was dennoch sehr viel Spaß bereitet. 
Seit dem letzten Update gibt es jedoch einen Hardcore Modus, welcher dafür sorgen soll, dass die Gegner den Spieler verfolgen, schnelller attackieren, Hiebe gezielt parieren und Combos einsetzen. Getestet habe ich das bisher noch nicht. Außerdem wird das Spiel durch Updates um neue Areale erweitert, welche auchim normalen Modus verfügbar sind. 

Die Sendeboxen sollten für dieses Spiel gut ausgerichtet sein, damit sie die Controller auch in geduckter Haltung und an möglichst jeder Ecke des Spielbereichs einfangen können, da sonst die Verbindung abbrechen kann. Den vom Spiel voreingestellten automatischen Pause-Modus für diesen Fall kann man im Spielmenü deaktivieren, was ich jedem empfehlen würde, da die Controller in der Regel sofort wieder gefunden werden und man meistens nichts davon mitbekommt. Die Präzision im Kampf ist beeindruckend, sodass man wirklich das glaubt die Wucht eines abgewehrten Schlages zu spüren. 
Die Fortbewegung geschieht mittels Teleportation oder freiem Bewegen im verfügbaren Raum. Das Teleportieren wirkt dabei nicht störend, Motion Sickness war bei mir ebenfalls kein Problem, wobei ich auch relativ unempflindlich dafür bin. 

Zum Spielumfang kann ich noch nicht viel sagen. Ich habe es noch nicht durchgespielt und zudem befindet es sich ja noch im Early Acces Modus. Dennoch bekommt man bereits jetzt ein toll ausgearbeitetes Spiel, welches manch bisher noch nicht erlebtes Spielgefühl aufkommen lässt und den Preis meiner Meinung nach vollkommen rechtfertigt. Wenn ihr also ein Spiel haben wollt, welches euch großartig in die Welt der VR-Spiele einführt, dann drückt jetzt auf den Kaufen Button."
28469013,best EVER
28468852,"Oculus Touch works on this game, I recommend haveing Vive or buy more sensors 3 or 4 you cant turn the cam when in game so when you need to walk down a hall or fight a boss faceing the wrong way its really hard to do. what i do is stand back far a way from my arms and hold them out as i fight sideways so the sensor can see my hands. really good game just missing a way to turn but then again this game is not listed under oculus support as of right now. so wait till they add it buy more sensors get the vive or play like i am and work your azz off just to try and pick some loot up off the ground behind you. goodluck we need more games like this for oculus the hole RPG thing is awsome!"
28465189,"I've beaten it, had my brother beaten it, then beat it again on hard mode with all of the in-game achievements (excpet ""heroic deaths). It gives you a terms of agreement when you first open the game basically stating that if you mess up your controller, ceiling fans, computer monitors, etc while playing the game, they're not responsible. First I thought, ""I'm super careful and have rarely ever tapped my controller against a wall in the past 5-6 months of Vive ownership. This game, you will 100% for sure hit your controllers against the walls several times. My brother even cracked one of the controllers open slightly (it snapped right back together). So be careful and have fun. 

10/10 would bash my controllers against my wall again for this game."
28459623,"I agree - this is Zelda for VR. Very exciting, sword combat very lifelike, strong D&D feeling."
28458843,Played this with oculus touch in 360 setup. Great fun!
28457933,A Must have for any VR owner. One of the most immersive experiences so far that I have had.
28457096,"Ich hab das Spiel im März als eins meiner ersten VR Spiele gespielt und es ist mit abstand eines der Besten. Leider aber auch sehr kurz. Wer Schwertkampf in VR mag, ist hier richtig. Grafikmäßig und Settingmäßig ist es sehr Zelda-ähnlich."
28456419,"This game is great fun. Exploring Dungeons with monsters, gathering weapons, money and stuff. The fights are fun...
It is a good dungeon crawler in vr. The two chapters took me 3.7 hours in normal mode. i am sure i missed some secrets. 
i recommend it to everyone who likes dungeoncrawlers. very good spend 20 bucks already, with more to be added"
28454371,"This game is a very good start for your VR libary. You do need the right amout of space 9 by 9 feet is good.
If you liked Zelda on the N64. I magine being inside it. 

The level of detail is nice, not phot-realistic . The first time  an 8 foot tall skeleton  the reto console feel keeps you from wetting yourself. The puzzles are simple and the spacing of both the puzzles and the combat lend to a nice game flow."
28453985,"Kurzweiliges, liebevoll gemachtes Fantasy-RPG mit der ein oder anderen Balance-Schwäche (vor allem bei den Bossen). Grafik sihet wunderbar plastisch aus und es läuft absolut flüssig (i7, R290). Hier darf es gerne einen Nachfolger geben! =)"
28441576,I have purchased about 50 games for the Vive.. This one is in my top 3. So well executed. Can't wait for further expansions.
28440297,"Great Game, can't wait for new chapters!"
28439208,"Sehr zu empfehlen! Wirklich sehr gutes gelungenes Rollenspiel mit einer wirklich geilen Grafik.
Spielzeit ist wie immer leider sehr kurz mit zwei Stunden, dafür mit wieder spielwert!"
28436565,"Takes me back to the first time I was blown away by a game, the original Ultima Underworld. This is easily the best game on the Vive as of the end of 2016."
28435863,"If you have ever heard of mount and blade, this is like a VR version of that. Highly recommend if you have HTC Vive! Must have."
28431437,This is the game I wished for as a kid playing titles such as Dungeon Master.  Being IN the game.  The fighting system is amazing and can be quite tiring.  Plenty to interact with and lots of hidden areas that you can go back and explore.  Well worth the money.
28429630,"Sehr immersives Spiel. Zieht einen in die schön gestaltete Fantasy Welt und bietet actionreiche Kämpfe! 
Hatte sehr viel Spaß damit und ist bis jetzt eines der besten Spiele für die Vive."
28403967,"First game I got for Oculus touch.  Absolutely love it - using melee, bows and even the torch are awesome.  Couldnt get the hang of the two handed axe, but dual wielding swords made me feel like a WoW rogue.

Wish it was a bit bigger, but the content feels fair at the price.   Will definitely get the expansion when it comes out."
28401977,"What a great game! Simple and straightforward but it just really works well....... I'm very slow at these type of games so I suspect it will be more like 20 hours gameplay for me :P

Some minor issues though but understandable for early access such as a bit of flicker when teleporting, very minor though and doesn't really detract from the game overall.

Some suggestions for improvement:

- Give us the ability to chose movement! Thought teleporting is ok for some, I personally can handle moving my car using the thumbsticks and don't get motion sickness.  Let us move normally would be a huge benefit to this game for me and I'd love it even more.
- Ability to turn on the spot without physically turning around - partly with the above movement, but often I find I'm facing all sorts of directions in some areas and I end up losing tracking (only 2 sensors but getting 3rd soon).  This would help if full movement couldn't be done.

Keep working on this and I'll buy more for sure, well worth the 14.99 right now :)"
28392383,Best VR-Game so far!
28381236,"Great game: one of my favorite VR game so far.
Great story, great graphic, engaging combact. 

Definitely recommended."
28379768,"I'm fairly new to the Vive and VR in general. Being a fan of RPGs, all signs pointed to Vanishing Realms as being the game of choice. Several minutes in and I wasn't disappointed. This immersive environment, while having a slightly cartoonish, Dragon's Lair-type quality, was extremely fluid and believable. While it doesn't have the same level of interactivity of games like ES:Skyrim, there is enough to keep you conscious of your environment (it's easy to set your floor on fire if you carry that torch too low!).  

I was extremely skeptical of the system of movement (teleporting) at first. Quickly I realized that with even a marginal play area, the mechanics worked very well. Being in the habit of smashing every container in site and wrecklessly grabbing every item in site with a mouse point or controller, the realistic action of picking up every item/coin/treasure and placing it in a ""pocket"" added a fun level of realism that made me appreciate the difficulty of being a ""hero"". 

Combat is simplistic, and yet precise all at the same time. There is a variety of weaponry, but I was fairly disappointed that there were no real physics or damage differences (that I was aware of) based on the weapon type (bashing hammer damage vs. slashing sword damage). I found the ability to duck and dodge while conducting archery combat to be extremely entertaining. The enemies become a little simplistic once you've gained some familiarity with the system, but the combinations present a challenge and keep things fresh.

The game has an intensity to it, when entering unknown caverns and labyrinths, that is completely lost in standard PC/Console gaming. Peeking shyly around corners, uncertain as to what surprise may lurk there. The sweat of actual combat! Hacking and slashing at a horde and wondering if maybe retreat is the right decision!

Overall, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms! It's a quick playthrough and I'm anxious for additional content! The possibilities are incredibly exciting and worth the investment.

28362105,"Absolutely fantastic game. One of my best experiences on the Vive, no doubt about it.

Amazing game and cannot wait for more content. 

I hope they add movement via controller and more customisation to your character!!"

ps : pour que ça ne se mette pas en pause toutes les 2 secondes, pensez à enlever la pause auto ^^"
28330208,"If you like RPG games like Zelda.......... GET THIS GAME!
I haven't played another RPG game like this in VR since and I wish it was longer! 
Where are the other levels!?!?!??!  Come on devs!
I have an i7 4790K and GTX1080 SC
Game works great and I just can't say enough about it!
Get this game and enjoy!"
28326951,"This is an essential VR title.  Setting is a bit generic, but it is executed flawlessly.  It feels cozy, yet dangerous. D&D style dungeon crawling with small rhyming clues here and there for flavor.  Swords, archery, magic, it's all there and really fun to use.  Good item system, and even a hardmode."
28324402,"Amazing!!

Think Zelda in VR,

"
28314500,"I bought this game but put off playing it for a while because the art is a little bland. I'm glad I finally fired it up yesterday. It has been my favorite VR experience so far. It was easy to get lost in the world.

Once you learn the control conventions the game uses, everything just works as you think it should. For example, the triggers grab. If I grab an item with the wrong hand (maybe I grab an item I want to throw with my off-hand), I just put the other controller on the held item and click that controller's trigger. The game swaps the item to the other hand. These touches are small but make it easier to feel more like you're in a place than playing a game.

It's a short but fulfilling experience. Highly recommended!"
28300503,"For all you die hard WoW players this could be your lucky day if you decide to purchase this game. You have everyhing from realistic combat from swinging a sword, 2 handed sword, bow, magic using a staff to tanking using a shield. Im sure that this game is just a stepping stone for what is to come with these types of RPG's. 

Pros: Graphics, combat, experience

Cons: Having to take the headset off."

28297229,"This game, even in the early state is amazing; for sure solid 3-4 hours game play and really fun game play at that. Worth the current price and a must buy if it gets on a discount.

Rating; 4.5 out of 5

Pros:
Mchanics are extremely solid and accurate and fun
Graphics are good enough and feel ""artistic"" and is well optimized
Sound is fantastic
The price!

Cons:
If you don't like to explore and feel like a fantasy bad ass; not the game for you
In some areas figuring out what to do next or the puzzles are a little harder than I would like"
28295233,Possibly the most immersive VR experience.
28285531,"I still need a new graphics card so that my computer can handle VR properly, but I couldn't help myself but to play this game because it looked like everything that I ever wanted out of VR, or at least the closest thing that current tech will make possible. I was not disappointed. I was sucked in and stayed there until my controllers needed to recharge. I can't wait to get back in. I can't wait to see how the game develops even further. I don't think that I can sing this game's praises enough. Though, I only just got out of it, so the excitement is still pretty high."
28261821,La suite ???
28257190,"I just finished the first chapter of Vanishing Realms and wanted to leave the developer some feedback...

First, my hardware specifications are:
   OS:  Windows 10 Pro
   Processor:  i7-4790 @ 3.60GHz
   RAM:  16 GB
   GU:  Radeon RX 480
   VR:  HTC Vive, Game Area 2m x 1.8m (Just Under Requirement)

I received my HTC Vive a few days ago and have, like many I suspect, gone into a frenzy downloading and trying out VR content.  I've had lots fun and been amazed with The Blue and delighted with Google Earth, as well as numerous other titles.  I am 100% sold on VR, and am excited to begin my own development for the Vive platform.  (I'm an old software developer by profession.)

One of the titles that kept popping up online when I searched for top rated VR content was Vanishing Realms.  I was hesitant at the price at first, however, as I've discovered that there is a lot of content that, quite honestly, isn't enjoyable.  But, I'm a big ""sword & sorcery"" fan and Vanishing Realms gets lots of good reviews, so I paid my $20.00 and...  Promptly forgot all about it.

A couple days later (yesterday, in fact) I was looking through my growing VR content library and saw that Vanishing Realms was in there.  I fired it up and put on the Vive headset.  That was a mistake...  I had a list of chores to do around the house and didn't get to any of them.

The first thing I noticed about Vanishing Realms was how polished it was, compared to other experiences I had sampled.  The Vanishing Realms menu system was very intuitive and responsive.  I often see some frame drops when using the Vive, but noticed none while playing Vanishing Realms.  I was worried that the somewhat ""cartoon"" (versus photo-realistic) graphics would detract from the experience, but I ended up really liking the graphics.  (The ""monsters"" were realistic enough to cause me to jump back in exclamation on more than one occasion!)  I'm afraid that trying to go too photo-realistic with the graphics would result in frame loss which would ultimately detract from the virtual reality experience rather than add to it.

The game's audio is great and really helped define the game's atmosphere, whether it be the sound of wind blowing, the crackle of a torch, or the clang of sword on sword.

I was already somewhat familiar with the ""blink"" movement system from playing with The Lab, where it works very well.  It works equally well in Vanishing Realms, although, at times, it can make some combat ""too easy.""  An arrow coming at you?  Just blink over a bit to dodge it.  Fighting a nasty creature hand-to-hand?  Blink in, hit, and blink out.  During gameplay, to ""even the odds,"" I tried to force myself not to blink too much in combat, as it seems like cheating in some way.

Speaking of movement, my play area is slightly smaller than the required 2m x 2m (I'm at 2m x 1.8m or so).  This did hamper my ability to reach certain items -- I would have to physically back up to the edge of my play area, and then blink closer to the object to be able to reach it.  This isn't the fault of the developer, however, and I am enlarging my play space which, I suspect, will solve this issue.  Also related to my smaller than required play space, sometimes, in the heat of ""battle,"" I would step out of bounds which paused the game, causing a brief ""disruption"" of the virtual reality play experience.

I really like the inventory system in Vanishing Realms.  I like that it takes a moment to fumble around switching weapons in the face of an enemy -- it's much more realistic than just clicking a button on a control pad to switch from bow to sword.

As mentioned previously, I paid just at $20 for the game.  After playing the first chapter I consider my $20 very well spent.  When compared to the cost of going to see a movie (which lasts only a couple of hours), the cost for Vanishing Realms appears to be a bargain.  I would be willing to pay for additional chapters and/or expansions upon my completion of the game.

All in all, I don't have many complaints regarding Vanishing Realms.  Sure, I wish there was MORE (more levels, more monsters, more scenes, etc.), but, again, the game is only $20 (compared to $60 I've spent for Xbox One games).  I also wish that the game was more difficult, but I understand that it needs to be accessible to a large audience and not just hard-core ""swashbucklers"" like me.  As it is, I know that my 11-year old son will enjoy the game without getting frustrated that he is getting killed every scene. 

All in all, I highly recommend the game and can't wait to play the next chapter.  I will also be keeping an eye out for updates and additional titles from the developer."
28254299,"Vanishing Realms ist eines meiner Lieblingsspiele für die HTC Vive, wenn nicht sogar das beste VR Spiel, dass ich bis dato gespielt habe. Wenn man es mit Games wie Skyrim etc. vergleicht ist man enttäuscht, wenn man aber weiß was es sonst so für  VR-Games zur Zeit gibt (hauptsächlich Demos, oder nur zum Erkunden, ohne Kampf, oder Wave-Shooter) dann ist Vanishing Realms eins - oder sogar DAS Beste RPG-Spiel für die Vive, dass es zur Zeit zu kaufen gibt.
Was es für mich von den anderen Games für VR so besonders macht ist unter anderem, dass man nicht nur auf der Stelle steht und von dort aus gegen Wellen von Gegner kämpft, sondern dass man sich in dem Dungeon (es gibt auch ein Außenareal) wirklich fortbewegen kann - wie in normalen RPG´s auch.  Es gibt auch einige einfache Rätsel, die Grafik ist für ein VR-Spiel gut. Einer der wenigen Titel für VR die ich wirklich durchgespielt habe und bald wieder spielen werde, da inzwischen viel Neues dazukam. Ich kann das Spiel für alle RPG-Liebhaber die eine VR-Brille haben nur empfehlen!"
28249935,This game is pretty great. I can honestly say that I forgot I was in my living room while I was playing. It does so many things right to make you feel there.
28242040,"Very  cool game where you are the character (WOW, LOTRO, ESO, Etc.)Hope they come out with more!"
28241403,"Super hra. Grafika je stylová ale příjemná. Pocit že jste ve hře je itenzivní a pohlcující. Jedna z nejlepších her na VR, povinost pro každého majitele HTC VIVE. Když se budete v chodbě krčit pod svištícími kyvadly a vykrývat zásahy od kostlivců , pak přijde ten pravý pocit vykradače dungeonu. Všem doporučuji."
28239857,"ich könnte langsam ein addon oder den 2. teil gebrauchen, tolles game"
28238332,"Amazing title! I have stepped into the realms of Zelda! Thank you kind dev! Great price, great adventure!"
28231366,"a good example of a well polished VR title.  Visually looks great with light and shadow and ambiance, but does not tax your system. Gameplay mechanics are solid and uses a teleport locomotion- no other movement offered. Beyond that, it's just all around fun. Lots of interactivity, good level design, appropriate price. 

Overall one of my favorite titles."
28230690,Absolutely amazing. A sell on the concept of VR for both me and my friends!
28223607,"Отличная игра. Понравилось абсолютно все,действительно рпг с несколькими видами оружия, инвентарем маной и хп) все как положено. рекомендую"
28221916,Awesome first game on the Vive. I actually responded like a tool when i got too close to the cliffs etc. Never did I think I would be weaving and be scared next to high places or for thinking I would walk into the alters lol.  Short but sweet but early access. More to come!
28215281,"Awesome Game!
1.Hoped I could dip my hand in the bucket of water to find treasure.
2.As well as the ability to have reflected arrows do damage.

Best VR game so far IMO."
28214512,"It stands out as one of the longer, more fleshed out VR experiences. For an RPG, it's generic and pretty bad, but it's a great start. It took me around 4 hours to complete chapters 1 and 2, which are the entirety of the base game."
28211514,"Just got the Vive, Best game by far.  Def worth it."
28208218,"Dieses Spiel zeigt ohne Zweifel was in VR möglich ist. Es macht spass die Welt zu erkunden, die Rätsel zu lösen und natürlich zu kämpfen. Ich will mehr."
28207458,This game is a blast but the price is a bit steap for such a short game.
28195837,"Very fun and the combat is really good, the enemies dont just sit there and take a few arrows to the face until they die, they get wise to it and start avoiding them to make you go in closer with the sword. I'd say this is one of the best vr games i've played and it's worth the money."
28194678,"현재 VR게임 중에 최고의 몰입도를 자랑하는 게임

28194000,"Super experience de RPG / VR. Vivement les niveau suivants ! 
Il ne manque plus que plein d'option pour le leveling et ce sera top !"
28193780,Exactly what I've been wanting from VR. Looking forward to more content!
28181708,"Wow, I love this game. Great combat interactions using wands, swords, axes, bows and sheilds. And it doesn't finish after 1 hour like many other VR games. 

Good clear graphics at distance also."
28180714,"10/10!!! I wanted a game worth the money. I wanted a real game. I wanted to have fun. Now the question is ""is there another game like this one?"" I dreamed to be in a dungeon. I was in a dungeon like in my best dreams. Take it and play it!! No regrets."
28178066,"Swords, spells, and shields! This game opened my eyes to what VR adventuring can eventually become. With some more polish and more complex combat and exploration, this could easily be a game I'd sink hours and hours into. 

That said, it's a little easy, and the treasure is frustrating to pick up. The UI placement was a little poor, as it was easy for it to be blurry when you looked down too much. The controls overall felt solid, and swinging your sword, shooting arrows, and blocking with your shield all felt great. The hammer was cool, but I just wish that it felt a little weightier. Combat was a little underwhelming (and as I said, easy), but it was just exciting to walk around in a dark fantasy world."
28171068,"Awesome game to showcase the HTC VIVE. Gives you a brilliant sense of emmersion,  one point and I see this in most VR games is the lack of detail when getting close to any objects, when you get close to a rock face or tree they look like cardboard cutouts. Come-on developers I'm sure its not that difficult to code some kind of fractols into it:-)"
28170623,Absolutely awesome game!
28167948,Best VR experience currently available
28163166,"I read the reviews and figured, it MUST be good.  It's not, and I'm scratching my head wondering how the reviews are overwhelmingly positive.  The animations are very rough, and the maps are pretty drab and uninspiring.  It made me a little motion sick as well.  I love RPG games, but this one is a little too cartoon'ish, and very unpolished."
28163143,"I've played a few of the top selling VR games on Steam, and I have to say I've had the most fantastic experience with Vanishing Realms. Don't be put off by the cartoony art style or relatively simple combat mechanics, the immersion is simply unparalelled. I had multiple experiences where I felt like I was actually walking through a fantasy dungeon and thought this is the future of gaming. Some might say the game is short, but I disagree. If you take your time exploring the dungeon for the hidden treasures and secret passageways, you'll get far more than your money's worth. My girlfriend and I have just completed the first dungeon and Steam tells me we have 5.5 hours clocked in. I simply cannot recommend this game enough.

If you have a Vive, you need this game."
28155426,"Thanks to the pattern of teleportation based movement in VR games Vanishing Realms™ makes you feel like you're part of an old school dungeon crawler. It's a bit lite and most of the challange comes from not knowing what you're health at any given point (but dying isn't punishing, thankefully), but it's packed so full of charm and good UX that it's a very satisfying experience.

"
28155234,玩起来好累0.0不过挺有意思的
28149836,"This game blew my mind. Period. Vanishing Realms was one of my first purchases for the Vive, and has been worth every penny. If you enjoy dungeon crawlers, rpg's, or some hack n' slash action definitely pick this one up! When my sis came over to give the Vive a try, this is the game I threw her into. 3 hours later, I'm having to literally pry the controllers from her so she'll give it a rest. Awesome game, I'll be running through it again for certain."
28148300,"Such a beautiful adventure game for VR! My play space is 2mx2.3m and it felt a little small but once you get used to teleporting around it's great. fully worth the money as it stands even thought it's still early access. it feels like the game is 95% done. 

I just got done with chapter 2 and will definitely be going back to get some cheives :D if you have a vive get this now!!"
28140960,Le jeu ne démarre tout simplement pas
28126689,This is a true VR Experience!
28126223,excellent dommage qu il soit si court ressemble plus a une demo qu un jeux
28121849,"This game is undoubtedly the best VR experience I've had thus far.

Pros:
-Beautiful Zelda/WoW inspired graphics
-The combat feels amazing and exhillerating (Fun swordplay, bows, magic)
-Parry system is really cool
-In-game achievements add some replayability
-Physically jumping up to grab apples off of trees is more fun than you'd imagine.

Cons:
-Longer than most titles out there, but still relatively short
-Enemies become predictable
-Anything less than 16gb of RAM will give you some stuttering in a couple areas, although still playable and relatively isolated.

Tip:
-Given that there is a fair bit of moving around in this game, the screen automatically pauses for you to move back to the center of your play area so that you don't slam into a wall. This can be disabled, but I highly advise against it.


Overall, a must have title if you own an HTC Vive."
28118537,"Quite exceptional. I've only played the first chapter so far, but the second will shortly follow.

The game is rich and full of wonders, both auditive, visual and gameplay-wise. There is a lack of real puzzles which is a shame, and the first chapter is rather short (2h), but the gameplay is crisp and intuitive, it feels really good to be part of the world, and you really feel like you're adventuring.

It's a good warmup exercice, aswell! Shakes you up.
I highly recommend this game. The price tag is a bit hefty for the time it takes to beat the game, but it's by far one of the greatest VR experience I've had."
28117953,A must have for VR.
28117617,"This is truly a Nobrainer. Buy it as soon as you get your VR-rig. 
This is one of the best games out ther to date.

There is ofcourse room for improvement. But not much. haha. I want more chapters and more gameplay. 

I love it!!!"
28115642,"I just got my Vive installed yesterday and I've gone from newbie exploring 360 images in Street View all the way to sparring with demons in a spooky dungeon. This game is the most unbelievable creation I've encountered so far in VR!

Although it is still early access, I haven't encountered any issues with the game, so far it is pretty flawless - really impressed!"
28114315,"'VR' is A really great game in VR.   No demo, 'VR' is a short yet substantial journey through a beautifully crafted world that is unlike any I've ever experienced as a gamer.   It is in my opinion a great first step in defining the ideal way in which we can enjoy traditional games in VR. The vivid lighting effects & majestic God rays are a sight to behold & made me stop on more than one occasion to take them in. The teleporting nature of gameplay feels good and controls become intuitive almost immediately. Shooting the bow is especially addictive & fun.  Just be sure you have a generous amount of space to play.  My space barely met the minimum requirement which I suspect created a fair amount of tracking issues.  Turning off the pause screen feature was helpful.  Buy this game now, just make sure you have some extra room on the minimum allowable space so your controls don't go haywire.

2019 Review Expansion 

Sundered Rift is a must if you enjoyed Vanishing Realms.  It boldly leverages the opportunities to innovate that Virtual Reality presents while not losing site of what has traditionally made games fun.  Vanishing Realms is a must have for anyone that loves VR or video games for that matter."
28113682,"I am really enjoying this.. I bought it based on the reviews, and ... 4.8 hours later after install.. yeah; you get the idea. It's very very good.
"
28106263,"Very nice game, Even with Oculus Steamvr and Hydra Controllers. I am going to play this again when my Touch controllers."
28105672,Amazing! I want a game with this same type of playstyle with like a little bit better graphics and like 5 hours longer and I'll Shit my pants. But this game is 100% worth buying!
28094852,"juego clasico de rol, basado en mazmorras,pero esta vez desarrollado para vr,una pasada"
28091030,"Some nice implementation for VR designers who are idea-mining, just unfortunate as the game is rather bland overall. Not much puzzle stuff. Mostly a gold loot and exploration game. Combat is ok. Feels like a well made Wii game."
28084026,"Wow, als vive owner is dit een must have :D"
28043141,Its the only fantasy experience for VR that feels like a proper game with polish and reliable mechanics.
28027825,比想象中还要好玩得多，招架和格挡特别有意思。是我现在最喜欢的一款游戏
28020133,"I bought this way after it's release and I have gotta tell ya... it's a great little game.  Don't think a newer game would be any better. It runs smooth on a 980. No problems, optimized great, never had any stutter.  I played it on hard and it took me 8 hours .  I only wish it had more levels and an ability to play with a friend. I'd love this as a co op with classes."
28017804,"Really cool fun game.
Wish I had bought it earlier.

Pros: Great game of decent length.

Cons: The face bumper gets very wet with sweat. (Don't play 2nd :) )"
28010522,"This was my first VR game and experience after the initial Vive setup. I have thorougly enjoyed every minute of it and cannot wait for more content from this developer and game specifically.

I was very engaged in the combat especially once you start fighting more than one enemy at a time. I wish I had a bigger playing area for room-scale though as I'd love to maneuver more.

Thanks for a great game!"
27997502,This is the best VR experince that I have had so far. This is also the most complete early access game i've ever played.
27997198,"Fun game, makes it feel like you are progressing. 
That said, it's short. Longer than most of these VR demo's selling as games but still, not very long. 
It was fun while it lasted and when it ended I found myself wanting more."
27930347,This is simply the best game out there for VR right now. You are in for a real treat if you like a dungeon/fantasy setting. Hopefully we see more from this very clever developer - he is leading the way in making VR games!
27916461,Lots of fun.
27905592,"From the moment you set foot in this game, the world feels alive and real. It's magical. It's haunting. It has a lot of depth, character and I can only hope that this game soars far. If we only had more games like this to truly show what the Vive is capable of! Amazing developers too!!"
27903888,"Vanishing Realms is one of the best VR experiences both in terms of what it presents, as well as the potential it shows. Vanishing Realms can best be described a one man DnD campaign. It provides immersive enjoyment in exploring the complex dungeon it creates. The multiple biomes, and unique interaction mechanisms made it my favorite VR game/experience on PC this year."
27900016,"This game is amazing.  You get to use bows, shields, swords, two-handed axes, and there's an awesome inventory system to store this stuff.  Chapter one was fantastic.  There was a really involved map and story that unfolded as you played, and the pacing was excellent.  It even got darker as I played (figuratively and literally), which I really liked.

I was really looking forward to chapter two, however, but it was not what I expected at all.  Where chapter one was like reading a book, chapter two was quite literally ""kill these guys really fast"" with no story to it at all.  There was a small arena on the same small map, and I was teleported back to the same area for every wave.  Felt very arcadey and really broke the immersion.

I hope that chapter two will be turned into a mini game or something and replaced with something as deep as chapter one.  I kinda feel like the developer decided to call it quits after chapter one and reluctantly made chapter two.  Regardless, chapter one is what makes this game."
27891251,"I hesitated to get vanishing realms for quite some time but after reading all the great reviews and seeing it was on sale I took the plunge. RPG style games are not my favourite but in VR even smashing barrels is fun!
The game has so much atmosphere and great presence, especially the fighting elements. 
Would highly recommend to anyone."
27879457,My wife has not played any other VR game than this one - the rest bore her.  But this one she became addicted to and played almost all the way through.
27877604,"A good looking game that runs well, is really immersive and has some nice mechanics? Butter my bottom, Vanishing Realms is that sort of game.
Also, turns out manually smashing up skeletons is a nice workout as well."
27875642,grymt spel
27853222,Top VR-Titel! Ein bisschen kurz leider! Gerne mehr!
27815858,"De loin le meilleur jeux sur vive !
Bravo ! en en veut encore des comme celui-là."
27813779,"Easily one of the best Vive games around. I got about 4 hours of playtime out of it on my first playthrough. It feels a lot like an RPG, but the only real progression you see is that you come across stations to buy new types of weapons as you go along.  I will say that the gameplay does feel short and simple, but is still one of the most fleshed out games on this relatively new platform."
27784985,"This is why i bought a vive! Such awesome sword battles, dual wield recomended!!"
27783248,"这是我买的最贵的VR游戏，也是最值得的。
游戏完整性很高，各个方面都展现了目前VR游戏比较高的水准，强烈推荐。

27782755,"Wow. This game is fantastic. With a good set of headphones on, its truely emersive."
27782592,One of the fullest experiences currently available on VR.
27753148,"This is a must-have for VR. It's not that fluffed-out when it comes to story, but the mechanics alone are a great joy!"
27734011,"Its a decent game, nothing too great."
27699365,this is an amazing game. i have no idea i didnt get this sooner. one of the closest games to being AAA game. its a must have for any vive owner. I really hope they reelease more content for this game.
27664925,룸스케일에 게임스케리까지 정말 재밌게 하고있습니다 바이브게임으로 적극 추천합니다.
27606641,"At 2.5-ish hours, Vanishing realms might seem short. However, it contains a lot of glimpses into what a full scale RPG might look like. Vanishing Realms is packed with small little puzzles, interactive environments, and encounters. Fighting feels clunky at the start, but much more fluid after a few encounters. At one point, I was parrying one enemy with a sword, and another with a shield. The  two-handed battle axe and bow, are an absolute joy to wield.

I haven't tried hard mode yet at this point, but I'd like to see slightly more responsive AI. For most encounters. It's very easy to lure enemies to fight them one at a time. I'm sure this is a design descision, but I'd take Assasin's creed style circling over enemies just standing still. 

If you've got the money to try it, and are interested in seeing how a dungeon crawler would feel in VR, give it a go!"
27582425,"Pretty solid game for VR.  It was the first game I actually thought that VR is going to be more than a fad.  It is fun, addictive, and active.  It was hard to put down, but my shoulders where getting tired from firing tons of arrows.  They have updated it as promised.  It has a lot to pffer for a little game.  I highly recommend it for the Vive."
27563964,"In a sea of wave shooters - Vanishing Realms is a welcome gem.

I consider Vanishing Realms a must have for VR today, especially for anyone who enjoys classical RPG's.

pros:
- art direction is perfect, looks great!
- world interaction a plenty, you will be smashing and burning to find coins hidden in just about every nook and cranny
- combat done very well, every battle feels intense and important 
- locomotion is designed for all users, teleportation with a 'stamina' style mechanism to prevent moving too far too fast
- inventory is the best ive seen, VR or flat, items go in your belt. simple 
- you hit rocks with a pickaxe 

cons (I struggled to find any real cons here):
- If you are used to open-world, this fairly linear experience might not satisfy (but there is plenty of exploring to do)
- some very minimal narrative - leaves you feeling a little bit 'aimless' in why exactly you are exploring this dungeon/world
- I've not yet finished it but replayability might be low
- no other method of locomotion for those who prefer 'walking' not teleporting

10/10 - must have"
27561701,"I finally got to experience a dungeon like I was really there! I want more! I prefer floating locomotion vs. teleportation, but this did not take away from the immersion. AWESOME stuff! Can't wait to continue the adventure!"
27556472,"Heute gekauft und 4,5 Stunden am Stück gespielt.
Macht wirklich spaß und es gibt sehr viel zu Entdecken.
Es lohnt sich wirklich überall mal genau hin zu sehen.
Klare Empfehlung, schönes Spiel."
27554236,"Games like Vanishing Realms is why I purchased VIVE VR. Immersive, fun, and challenging - but VERY playable. VR is young and what we are seeing now is like PONG was in arcade games. Vanishing Realms (initials VR...nice) is a glimpse into the future. I can't wait to see what happens with VR! BTW We need more RPGs! 

As a community, I hope we review all the VR titles and hardware. What is cool (‘cuz VR is COOL) or just trying to cash in on the wave -  share our views. And share productively as to move out the junk and promote good stuff. Vanishing Realms is well worth the price. I am having great fun with Vanishing Realms and feeling like spending $800 on a VR system was OK. We need MORE like this. More well done RPG titles. 

This is my opinion and yours may be different. Thanks for reading.
Peace.

27551389,"Best of the indie games, which is damning with faint praise.  Last one I buy. Ready for AAA games ! I find most indies a waste of time and money."

27403538,"If this is the beginning of VR then we are doing well. Basically dungeon master, with a focus on puzzles as much as combat. Graphically pleasant in a WoW kind of way. I like the integrated HUD that you see by looking down. Im not a fan of the teleport motion but this does it well. This is a must for your VR library."
27360434,"关于这款游戏，喜欢的朋友可以关注一下我的游戏实测哦~还是值得推荐的哦

http://www.bilibili.com/video/av7176709/

关于这个款消失的国度，整体来讲是不错的，我想从3各方面来说：
1.游戏的画面：游戏画面很清晰，没有卡帧的情况，游戏的沉浸感也是很棒的；
2.游戏设置方面：这是一款冒险解密类游戏，前期你可能会觉得没有太大的意思，需要找各种东西去解锁，还要存钱买箭，但是当你到后期的时候，你就会发现会有格斗，厮杀的场面，尤其在和怪物的打斗，还是很需要技巧的，总体来说还是比较比错的；
3.游戏本身：这款游戏刚开始的时候会让你觉得无聊，所以个人建议可以初始带一点轻武器类的，让玩家边打怪边解密就不会显得前面太单一，这样玩家的沉浸感也会更好。
4.关卡的设置：在关卡的设置上面作者也是用心良苦，会让你在捡宝物的时候，突然受的攻击，真的是送你吃蜜枣又问你要钱的感觉啊！！！
不错，总体来说游戏还阿是值得推荐的！"
27337650,"Great game, WAY TO SHORT. Now the developer is talking about DLC we have to pay more for. What a joker. Just another Developer getting into the cash grab scene."
27267035,"it was Awesome game
but its  not update for a long time
"
27161209,"Got a Vive?  Looking for a game to show off what VR is about?  This is the game to buy.  It's an amazing experience and justifies its high praise.  My VR catalogue grows by the day and so far, nothing can touch this game."
27157173,"Gameplay that defines VR combat in terms of crisp accuracy of weapons and difficult enemies to defeat.Many people are unhappy at the announcement that further updates will likely cost a bit of cash extra, You'd be foolish to think you would get a 50 hour experience this good for 20$.  I will be dropping cash the second any DLC drops to get more of this game into my system."
27107294,"This game has gotten me hooked into VR. It is a blast to play, and easy to get immersed in. 
I only have a few complaints about this game.

1. It's WAY too short. I could easily spend a LOT of time in here.
2. I think this game has proven gameplay concepts, and could really benefit from a storyline, make it even more immersive.
3. This game makes me really work for it. I work up a sweat when playing."
27095799,"I think that anyone that has a VR headset in 2016 needs to pick this one up.

This isn't going to be the definitive VR experience for all time, by any means. But it is a great value for a *long*, engaging, user-friendly VR experience. 

Can be played with slightly less room than they reccomend, with caution."
27055616,"To any one reading this, I nominated this game as Best VR Game (We Didn't Think of Everything Award). This developer needs to be recognized for what he has created. This is what I had in mind when I bought an HTC Vive, you can tell alot of work and love went into creating this. One of my favorite games you won't regret buying this one."
27050593,"This was one of the first games I got for the Vive. It was amazing. The sense of presence is intense. The one thing I appreciate the most is the auto pause feature. This paused the game if the player starts swinging wildly while getting too close to the edge of the play area. While it does trigger fairly often for a small play area, I know that it saved me from destroying my system or my TV multiple times.

A great game with some really forward thinking UI choices. I am excited to see what the next chapters hold."
27047866,"Just played through the entire game (through to the end of the arena as of writing) in one sitting- err.. Standing. This is hands down the best virtual reality game on the market. Every inch of the game is very well thought out, the island is really well designed and cool to explore, the dungeons are great, the art style fits well, the combat is good, and the riddles are fun. The only downside I experienced was performance issues in the arena, as I'd get see ""THIS IS REAL"" for a split second when walking in for the fight or when groups of enemies were spawning in (running on a 1080, this probably shouldnt be happening, but it is early access).

Easily my most recommended VR game so far!"
26992963,This game is blowing me away. Been in it for about 3 hours and its bloody amazing. If only there was multi player with coop...
26969545,Great graphics and really immersive. I wish it was longer.
26964803,Pretty good... teleporting around is lame but still good.
26949710,"One of the best VR titles out there. This game really takes you into another world, feels like a well polished game and, overall is simply mind blowing.

I highly recommend this game to anyone with a compatible VR Headset and motion controllers."
26910952,"Does what it says on the box.  Do you like exploring dungeons, finding treasure, and fighting skeletons?  This is that, and the immersion feels great.  Just remember to look up every once in a while - there's treasure *everywhere*."
26908340,One of the best cases for VR being the future of gaming. Utterly transports you to another place where you have adventures and fight monsters.
26886943,"This is easily the closest to a Zelda like game you can get in VR.  
The puzzles change things up, as does the weaponry.  
The updates keep coming and keep making it better!
"
26798897,Do you own a Vive? Do you love video games? Yes and Yes? Then do yourself a favour and play this right now!
26759072,"Really Nice game (strickly RECOMMENDED!)!! Looking forward for chapter 3.

Good:
Feeling of reality. Enviroment designers. Story. Interaction with things. Options for fight and carry stuff. 

Not so good:
Not much thinking is necessary to move forward, in other words, everything is obvious, you do not need to read any tip. It does not change the interaction and fun of the game, but it could be improved.
Maybe as a matter of user safety, the game (as usual in VR) is not as scare and tense as it could be. Enemies show up from a long distance and never attack you or approach you by surprise. This is not only the game fault, but VR games as a whole assume people are incapable to be safe if the push a little bit hard. I do not thing people are that much rreettaarrded. Please make VR games more exciting. 10% of causualties are fine. :-)"
26749321,"Лучший VR опыт, который можно купить за деньги. Настоящая РПГ с отличной боевой системой, ненавязчивым сюжетом, приятной немного жутковатой атмосферой и интересным исследованием мира. Первая Игра на Vive, в которой задерживаешься на час-другой (к сожалению, она пока за столько и проходится)"
26724329,Wow. What a great game! From excellent combat to fun-to-explore areas and secrets I loved every minute of it!
26723423,"Absolutely incredible. My first Steam review as a result. I just fell over trying to climb on a table that wasn't there. It's like living Knightmare from when I was a kid. Good intuitive puzzles, amazing environments, excellent fighting. Bow skills are incredibly fun but so is whacking away with a sword and shield. You can dodge, sidestep, block, parry. I actually feel like I've beaten someone when I win. I love picking apples from a tree and dropping them in your bag, mining with a pic, setting fire to curtains to see a monster behind. It's just brilliant!

I thought standing in the middle of the room would annoy me with VR. Not with this game. It's like living another life. I think at £15 it's an absolute bargain. I can't recommend it highly enough. I normally don't like dungeon crawlers. Or puzzle games. This one is like nothing else. I recommend it wholeheartedly!"
26722464,"This really hits a VR sweet spot. Aside from the main menu screen the UI is seamless and innovative, which is a must for an RPG.

This is more of an RPG lite. It does a small amount of things, but does them really well. The combat is pretty decent, at first you can feel a little overwhelmed, but as you recognise the patterns it becomes a fun timing puzzle. By the end you'll be cutting down foes left and right.

There was certainly more in here than I expected. I especially enjoyed the sense of exploration. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more lengthy VR experience.

Graphics are pretty simple, but on this early generation of VR headsets it works really well. This will no doubt look dated in a year or so."
26721936,"One of the first games I've played on the HTC Vive. It is very well made - near-perfect teleporting system, nice visuals, good interactivity with the monsters (yes, they only react - with is perfect for noob players). The overall game has a great atmosphere to it - I really felt transported. Showed it to a couple of friends and they were all happy to play. Great work!"
26720059,"So far the best dedicated HTC Vive title I have tried.
Been going through some games and this one turned out to be really enjoyable.
Teleporting only, which is a slight dissapointment, but gameplay still works great.
I have to mention that sadly it is a bit short.
If the upcomming chapters are reasonably priced DLCs I just might grab them.
"
26717387,BEST VR GAME IVE PLAYED SO FAR
26716489,"I'm not exaggerating when I say that this game is the reason I bought the HTC Vive. I played this game for about an hour on a friend's HTC Vive, and it simply blew my mind.

If you grew up wishing you could feel like you were inside the worlds of Zelda or its like, then this game is for you. The controls are incredibly intuitive, using the growing standard for movement found in The Lab and other games. Combat and action are absolutely astounding. The controls are so responsive, and the mechanics of hitting and missing are so well executed, that it really feels like your physical skill makes a difference.

And don't even get me started about the archery. Ducking behind cover, and popping up to shoot arrows at your opponents is like a 8 year old's dream come true, finally, at 41.

And the environments are fantastic. The ambient sound is very well executed, and the art style is excellent and consistent.

I really have nothing bad to say about this game excpe that at the time of my playing, it was too short! Can't wait for more content like this."
26714407,Absolutely Fantastic!  Hands down the best game for the Vive!
26703219,"A glimpse of the future of the fantasy RPG genre.
Today I revisited it and discovered the new content.
The only thing I can say is - WOW!
Fun, imaginative, immersive.
PLEASE give us more content!
But (especially for this being an absolute indie title), it's already worth every Cent you pay for it.
It may not be the longest experience, but if you really want to get every treasure & secret, you can probably play at least  three hours. Probably more. Less if you're really fast."
26699850,"This game is a blast. Truely a great RPG VR game, it really shows the potential of VR. I hope more games similar to this one are to come."
26698225,"I've played this game on the HTC Vive i picked up a week or two after it released. Extremely immersive, Really gets to your head. Also had my roommate and best friend play this on my vive, and everybody loved it. Highly Recommend. Great family game too, had my 8 and 9 yr old cousins try it. They, without fail, ask to play it every time i see them."
26687238,"great but short game need track pad movement option teli is so bad
"
26681158,Absolut Klasse!
26669941,"Great game, great visuals, somewhat flaky storyline
But its loads of fun 

Highly recommended"
26668055,"Is this a great experience, owl? 
Yes, it is other owl.
Would you recommend this game to people that you do not hate?
Yes, I would other owl.
The first true RPG feeling I have gotten from a vive game. Complete with secret treasures, hoarding gold and smashing your enemies mercilessly to death with a double-handed axe… I mean most of these skeleton men do not even attack until your come to close and that just to say, “Hey, buddy, PERSONAL SPACE!”
I say buy this game now, play it and then yell at the devs so they make more.
"
26667496,i have played this game for about a hour and addicted to it . the puzzles and the over all game play gives me the feel of zelda in vr its really amazing with the inventory slots and health and mana this game has true feel of rpg/ hack n slash. good job to the creators! love see more games like this.! well worth the money =D
26666963,"Almost certainly the best game in VR right now. This is exactly what VR games should be. Exploration, interactions, the motion control, and the most polished combat mechanics I've ever seen. Definitely a must have considering games with far less gameplay sometimes cost much more. 10/10"
26666379,"This is one of my favorite VR titles to date. Unfortunatley, there's not an immense amount of replayabilty, but there are in-game achievements to hunt for as well as updates (Still an early access title). Speaking of updates, the developer is fairly vocal about them, and that's always a good sign. They claim this game is 1.5 - 2 hours of gameplay. I'd say that's not accurate. It's more like an  hour if you're speed-running on easy, and more like 4 - 5 if you're playing seriously on hard. You could easily stretch that into 10 (or even 16+ like me) by going through and really exploring on hard. Read every drop of lore, upturn every rock and skull (sometimes there are suprises under there!), and just have a good time. This game is listening to feedback and really paving the way for what a VR adventure game should be.

If you like fantasy adventures, this is definitely for you. I felt like I was one of my favorite sword-swinging heroes!"
26640889,"Невероятно годная игра.
Даже не ожидал, что меня затянет.
По скриншотам вроде бы ничего особенного, но вы просто попробуйте.
Очень удобное и интуитивное управление, классные эффекты отдачи на оружии, очень весело махать мечом и стрелять из лука."
26632272,"I love love love this game.  It's like a VR Zelda game, in terms of exploration and combat.  You don't get experience and advance levels, it's more about getting new gear and gold.  There are some puzzles and levers to pull, lots of fun archery experiences and swordfights.  You feel like you are there, a great sense of presence.  Unfortunately the plot and music are lacking, but hopefully that will improve in a later version."
26627432,"This is a very good implementation of VR for a RPG game.  The graphics are kinda a mix between realism and WoW like textures.  I played it for 3 hours and I don't think I am very far in the game.  There is quite a bit of content.  While I did not find the game too difficult, fighting the mobs got my heart racing.  I tried to play it like Skyrim where I would shoot mobs at a very long distance.  I do say these are smarter than the skyrim ones because after they get hit once they will hide behind a shield or a wall and dodge arrows.  They seem to remember you were shooting at them too.  The baddies don't have a huge aggro range and you can usually get prepared to face them.  I do like the inventory system in the game and don't have to worry so much about what I can and can't carry.  Just about everything in the game is interactable.  There is also loot everywhere.  It is rather enjoyable searching for loot in hard to reach places or finding something and figuring out how to get it.  I really enjoy this game and I hope this company will use this game engine to make more titles in the future."
26620407,"First game bought for my Vive. I was thirsty for a melee game. Paid full price for it too. Its very well done. Combat is smooth, and fluent. Whenever I show off my Vive or my friends want to get lost in VR, this is the go to game. Hopefully the devs come out with dlcs or another product.

10/10 would pay full price again."
26616139,"Pour moi un indispensable de la VR même si l'expérience est un peu courte et l'histoire complètemet inutile.
Le gameplay et  l'univers valent largement le détour.
Bon suivit des développeurs pour un jeux qui mériterait juste plus de contenu et une histoire plus poussée"
26615343,Best game on the Vive. FACT! And I've had my vive for 6 months.
26610314,"Its a fact, I don't write reviews very often.  Most games I don't finish.  Its not due to lack of interest, but more to time availablility and other new shiny things distracting me.  

This game though...  this game is amazing.  When I picked up an HTC, I really got into Elite Dangerous, but this game is what VR is all about to me.  The world is just beautiful.  The mobs are fun to fight, they aren't always predictable, and smashing to piles of bones is a blast.  Aside from getting into it so much I almost put a hole through my TV, I have not one complaint.

Super A++ to the devs. Thanks for doing such an amazing job.  I can't wait for Chapter 3."
26610189,"Although short, this game is quite the workout.  If Zelda were in VR, it would have started out like this.  ;)"
26609267,"What a game! This is the first game I bought for VR and wow it has put a high bar on anything out there at the moment!

I just finished Chapter 2 and I must say I can't wait for Chapter 3 and a full game!

My dad who is 50 years old also absolutely loves the game!

Keep up the good work!

Cheers"
26608198,"I first bought this game in June 2016 when it was still quite far from complete, so after 30min of playing I decided to wait for some more updates. Now when I finally gathered my interest again and tried a quick session of this berofe sleeping. It was not quick. 

I finished both chapters in one fell swoop and suddenly it's 2am as it took me approximately 2 hours to finish. It was probably quite fast because I did cheese some challenges pretty hard with some bow kiting and a lot of dual-sword mayhem.

Immersion was really on a similar level with Onward and I loved the gameplay and polish there is now in this game. 

Only thing I was left hoping for was the story. It left me a bit dry, even if it is better than pretty much any other Vive game at the moment I've tried. I really hope the dev gets a co-writer for chapter 3 as this game would be a beautiful framework to hang a truly great story on."
26600868,"Simply Beyond anything else out there. I let my family try it and it was pretty much like having an episode of Knightmare in the room.

"
26590760,"So I'm going to answer questions I would have like to see an answer in those reviews:

[b]Movement:[/b]
teleporting and room scale (impossible to rotate the room as far as i know, so pretty annoying sometimes)

[b]Lenght: [/b]
The game is quite short: i took me 2 hours completing it and exploring and getting all the chalice (now I have to do it in hard mode)

[b]Replayability:[/b]
Once you completed it once, I really do not see the point of re-doing it, as it will be exactily the same, they could have implemented chapter 2 with infinite waves.

Chapter 1 it's pretty nice, chapter 2 it's a really not a chapter but more 10-15 minutes of games where you have 9 waves of monster to defeat, really zero point.

[b]In terms of story:[/b]
there is no story in the game, or almost null, the few sentences you encounter are regarding a specific loot you can get or guide you to the next objective. it's a pity that there is no voice over at least on those few sentences.

Graphics are as you see in the screenshot, I personally like the style.

[b]Cons:[/b]
seeing the last update from the dev, even if it's still in early access, the game won't change much, and all additional content will be a paid DLC.

Wasn't expecting that from an early access game of still being on early access but working on next paid content.


If i would have to put a vote I would give it 
[b]6.5/10[/b]

I bought this game cause I'm sure my wife will like it, if I would be alone, won't probably buy it: 20 euro for 2 hours of game is not worth.
"
26588117,"Short (5 hours with a fair amount of stopping to admire the VR effect) but so very, very sweet. Well worth the money. I will be replaying this at the harder setting after a break. I never thought I would feel I was REALLY dungeon crawling and REALLY fighting monsters. DRUMS IN THE DEEP. So cool."
26586051,"like this game a lot, i hold my sword and  shield, the enemy arrows strike through it , the sound and everything was so real, thats was an awsome experience, enjoy a lot in this game!!"
26570218,"I loved it. And I am a borned critic, yet this game is awsome. I recomand it."
26569321,"What a great experience. One of the best games for the Vive so far, and the best VR RPG hands down. Can't wait for the next installments.

It's short, but not too short. You won't get through it in a single session, most likely it will take several, depending on your VR stamina.

Pros:

- Great use of the Vive with some interesting mechanics that play out really well, like throwing things to knock treasures off of high ledges, and the utility belt approach to inventory.

- Several weapon choices that offer different playstyles for each one, from the sword & board, to the bow, to the dragon wand (nuclear option), and a couple of others. This lends some replayability to the game that otherwise might not be there... I want to replay it just to master the 2-handed battle axe, which is probably the toughest weapon to master in the game. Not due to poor design, it just takes some practice to get right, and your first time through you'll probably gravitate to the easier weapons.

- Well-balanced gameplay. The difficulty seems appropriate at each level of the game, and it's never too easy or hard. By the time you hit the trials, you'll be swashbuckling and teleporting like it's second nature, but you'll still need to be fast on your feet while staying on top of your situational awareness to win.

- It's got some flavor. Just the simple act of lighting all the candles and torches you find is deeply satisfying (plus there's an achievement for it). There's some treasure that's pretty well hidden too, look absolutely everywhere. Burn stuff. Shoot apples.

- Combat is very fulfilling. Some of the enemies are downright tough, and order some replacement foam rings right now, because you're going to break a sweat. Sidestep to flank, teleport behind, low shot under the shield, duck and cover, come over the top with the battle axe... all valid tactics, and you're going to want to use them.

- No stability problems or gameplay issues. Smooth and easy.

- You haven't lived until you've dodged a fireball three inches from your face.

Not much in the way of Cons, but I'll try:

- It's linear. As mentioned before, the various weapons offer different playstyles for each, but essentially there is nothing procedural or random about the game. However, the overall experience is enough fun that I'll play it through a few more times anyway.

- ALMOST too short, but I'm going to give Indimo a hall-pass here because, relatively speaking, it's the most fulfilling RPG out there so far IMO. They have also laid the groundwork for some really playable (and replayable) mechanics that I hope to see more of in future releases.

- Some of the lore poetry is pretty hokey.

All in all, with the state of the art as it is, Vanishing Realms is an absolute must-buy, and hopefully soon turns into a franchise that I'll be sticking with for the duration.

Highly recommended 9.5/10."
26563928,"[h1] Vous avez toujours révé de jouer à Zelda en VR?! Ce jeu est ce qu'il vous faut!	[/h1]

Alors, commencons par l'état de cet early acces:
C'est bien optimisé vu que les graphismes sont plus du coté de la wii que d'un PC de derniere generation. Pas de lag, un framerate constant (obligé pour ne pas voir de cinétose) qui rendent l'aventure agréable.
Le gameplay est facile à prendre en main tout en ayant certaines petites difficultés. Il vous fraudra part moment jeter des objets à des endroits bien précis et ca ne sera pas chose facile! Les armes sont intuitives et repondent de maniere trés naturelle. Le déplacement se fait par le biais de téléportations (déplacement que j'apprécie avec la VR mais pas le plus immersif) mais le roomscale est bien pris en compte (on se voit faire des pas de cotés pour éviter les fleches énnemies).

Le jeu en lui même:
C'est un dungeon crawler ou un jeu comme Zelda pour les anglophobes. On y parcourt un dongeon (pour le moment vu qu'il n'y a que les 2 premiers chapitres) avec quelques zones en extérieur. C'est fun, les differentes enigmes sont simples et les combats assez rudimentaires mais trés instinctifs."
26563726,"I just finished the first two chapters of this game. This game is great. It is not perfect but it still a great game to have on VR. I'm excited to see what is in store for the rest of the game. There are pointless parts of the game. In the game, you get three swords. The problem with that? You get the second one at the same time as the third unless you backtrack. There is no reason to use the second one. There is a second shield but I could not tell you why it is better than the first.

I would suggest you have a massive play area to use this. I have 2.5m x 2.5m space and this is too small, way too small. I recommend 3m x 3m or larger. Also, you will be moving around quite a bit when using this game. Make sure your headphones are on secure.

As far as suggested features, co-op multiplayer would make it amazing. A training mode would be awesome or just a mode to mess around with all of the weapons. Overall, I would give this a 4/5. The game works fairly well. I haven't seen any bugs but it does feel like an early access. If you want an awesome VR game, I suggest you pick this up. Someone said it was like a combo of Zelda and Skyrim. I wouldn't go that far but you will not be disappointed with this game."
26556345,This game is probably the first and best VR game that isn't a demo that you play once but a full fledged game with levels where you just continue playing like any other normal game. Totally reccomend this game if you want to play VR and not demo VR!
26550139,"Most immersive game I've played.  Wow, just... wow!!!!!!!!!!!!"
26549718,"Great and fun little game.  I love the graphics and environment, with the style being somewhat cartoony I would normally have thought it would look bad, but it doesn't.  I replayed again today with the new updates and the new areas are really good.  Having played it before though, I knew I could go back and fight the king prior to finishing any of the new updated areas, so there should probably be a way that blocks you from going too far back... maybe a cave in or something.  Overall, the price for this game is worth it in my opinion, and I am glad that I got in on the early releases.  The way the game tries to prevent you from beating your room up is very well done imo."
26538066,"I played up until I got the first sword.  I played with the sword and began to dislike combat and simply moved on to another game.  My reasoning was that combat and puzzles are both too easy.   Puzzles in this game add up to simple fetch-object-from-a-few-feet-away-and-bring-back-to-other-object moments.  These puzzles required no thinking and were just boring.  Yes, it's VR, so it's very immersive, but that will only get you so far!  Picking up objects felt good, and throwing objects played into some puzzles, which was kind of clever, but that really wasn't required to progress through any portion of the game, which was already pretty short.  It was also very unoptimized and ran very slowly at times for unknown reasons.  I mean, VR is demanding, but NRAN runs much more smoothly and has much more going on (including emulators and minigames and more realistic lighting/shading), so I'm disappointed with this game's performance by comparison.

Overall, this could be a good purchase at $5 but is definitely not a good purchase at $20."
26524360,"Eines der wohl zur Zeit besten Spiele für die Vive. 

Man läuft durch eine abwechslungsreiche Welt, man kann viele verschiedene Dinge sammeln und benutzen. Es macht Spaß gegen die Gegner zu kämpfen.

Für diesen Preis bekommt man ein super Spiel.

Vielen Dank an den Entwickler!"
26523835,Awesome!
26511218,"This is a great game, a must for getting into VR."
26509110,"Одна из первых игр которые Я попробовал в htc vive, графика простая, особых изысков в игре нет, но тем не менее Она затягивает, игра весьма интересная и ещё не разу не заставила выключить себя потому что надоела. Бои в этой игре крайне затягивающие, и при должном уровне энтузиазма и интереса превращаются в настоящий поединок."
26495137,"So I'm going to start this off by saying that I don't know if this is worth buying, just on length alone. It took me about 100 minutes to beat the game and I think I did pretty well exploring and going around. It looks decent enough, sometimes even really good. I like that they put in boss bottles, that was certainly entertaining, even though it takes you 5 minutes to learn you can safe spot them or just shoot a bunch of arrows at em. Not much of a challenge that way. They do have a bunch of different weapons you can try (my favourite being hammer in left and sword in right.) They made it so you can't just shove your sword out and shake it around in small circles. Seems like this game will have more content in the future so I'd recommend getting it, it's pretty fun. Though maybe a bit."
26489757,"Superb, enjoyed this immensely.  
I definitely look forward to more chapters (which I am perfectly happy to pay for btw!)
"
26486620,This game is like a Zelda game in VR.   REALLLLLY fun.  You'll love it.
26486221,This is by far the best VR experience I have ever had.  The combat is fun and engaging.  The graphics are well done.  The puzzles are nice casual fun.  I cannot recommend this game enough.
26482812,Pretty short but it was a great experience. Looking forward to new episodes. Feels like what a basic version of Zelda VR might be like.
26476819,"Also ich finde das Spiel ist wirklich eins der Besten bisher für die Vive (Stand November 2016)....habs beim Halloween-Sale für 15€ ergattert und muss ganz klar sagen 20€ sind auch ohne weiteres gerechtfertigt (hab zu dem Preis schon viel grösseren Mist erworben...). Man wird voll in die virtuelle Welt gezogen und vergisst Zeit und Raum (OK...auf den Raum wird man ständig hingewiesen wenn man der Chaparone zu nahe kommt :) ).
Wenn man RPGs, Fantasy und (leichte) Rätsel mag ein Pflichtkauf !
Wunderbare Mechanik, für meinen Begriff ein ausreichender Grafikstil (ist wie bei vielen anderen Spielen...dem einen gefällts, dem anderen ists zu ""simpel"") und eine top Athmosphäre - wobei etwas mehr Sprachausgabe ganz nett wäre.

Die Kritiken der Negativbewerter finde ich teilweise nicht gerechtfertig oder evtl. veraltet (ist ja Early Access und wird laufend optimiert). Bei mir könnte man z.B. die ""Chaperone-Hauptmenü-Funktion"" mittlerweile auf Wunsch deaktivieren.
Das Thema Fortbewegung ist auch eher geschmackssache - ich z.B. mag teleportieren weil ich an Motion Sickness leide bei Games wie z.B. Hover Junkers.
Über zu kurzen bzw. zu wenig Content zu meckern bei einem Game im Early Access finde ich auch fraglich...wer weiss denn was da noch kommt...

Warten wir´s mal ab was noch kommt....für 20€ auf jeden Fall eine klare Empfehlung und für mich sicher besser als den 40. Waveshooter zu kaufen :)

"
26471470,"Had this for months without playing it....and then I started playing it on my Vive. Now I can't put it down. Absolutely love it, very engrossing! Probably one of the best VR titles currently available and makes a very refreshing change from the endless stupid zombie/robot shooting gallery titles that are cluttering up the Steam VR store."
26469369,"I was not a fan, the game was hard to get into. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea."
26469026,This is one of the best VR games I have played so far.  Would definately like to see more games like this.
26466123,"This is by far the most immersive VR game I have ever played. It doesn't get you motion sick, keeps you completely rooted in suspense, and has lots to discover and experience. Definitely the best game for the Vive currently out."
26465870,I really enjoy playing this game.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm very glad I purchased it.
26462072,een van de beste ervaringen op mijn htc vive tot nu toe.
26461997,really good game. works up a sheat too
26460119,"the quality of its VR experience should be marked with ""worderful"", but the game name should be mark wiht ""Demo"","
26452353,"The first VR game I have finished and the first to hurt my leg by dropped jaw! Very well done. Nice graphics, intersting story, engaging combat (I've played it BEFORE it got all new bells and whistles, so now it could be even better!). A must have title for every VR owner :)"
26450050,Who wouldn't want to play a vr fantasy game where you get to parry and hack 6 foot tall monsters not to mention shooting arrows whilst dodging fireballs.
26448044,"This is my favoriote VR game so far. It is a large world and the graphics are some of the best I have seen in VR - sharp images, no fluttering, etc. This game has a couple of difficulty levels so if you want a realitely easy game vs a more challenging game you can choose the experience. This game combines puzzle solving with hand to hand combate and shooting (bow and arrow). This may not be for everyone, for example it is not a fast paced shooter, but if you want to experience a great VR world which you can explore for hours this is a great choice."
26447366,"Finally, a game with scale and a sense of world immersion. This is a highly enjoyable gaming experience with outstanding visuals and mechanics. Vanishing Realms is an absolute must own game for Vive owners. We need more games like this for the Vive."
26439234,"Quel plaisir de pouvoir enfin incarner un hero de rpg !

J'ai mis le casque, lancé Vanishing Realms, et je me disais : ""Allez prochain checkpoint et j'arrête"" -> J'ai jouer une heure sans m'en rendre compte. J'ai adoré, au bout d'un moment on est tellement dedans qu'on s'y croirais !

Les cotés moins drôle :
Il a fallu que je révise l'installation du casque car je voyais mal au niveau de ma taille, la où est situé inventaire et HP/MP.
les ennemis ne sont pas très très véloces au début, peut-être cela change t'il plus tard, malgré tout j'ai bien eu chaud à force de me battre avec mon épée :D

Concernant le vive :
Je joue dans une pièce de taille minimal, et souvent le jeu se met en pause car je suis trop proche des limites, prévoir une grande pièce  :p
Et comme d'habitude, dans ce type de jeux à force de tourner, regarder, marcher, le cable du Vive à tendance à se faire plus souvent remarquer

Je recommande à tout les amateurs de donjon/rpg."
26428637,I just finished all of the early access content for this game and feel it was more than worth the price. Definitley among the top Vive experiences I've had so far.
26413118,"Optisch ist es nicht so ganz mein Stil, aber die VR-Umsetzung ist absolut klasse!"
26407913,"This has to be the closest thing to a Complete game I have yet seen. Still early, but its absolutely my Fav so far"
26403398,"Easily the best game for VR right now. Raw Data and others are fun, but they don't have the depth that this one has. Plus those others are really exercise intensive where this one you think a little more."
26403004,"OMG.... U WILL BE DUMB IF YOU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,,,,
"
26378752,"Les plus : plusieurs heures de jeu, des combats pas très variés, mais immersif et sympa. Il faut bien penser a ne pas se faire déborder. On se retrouve a explorer des dongeons, combattre des ennemis, ramasser des ressources comme dans un RPG classique. Il y a des enigmes.
Les moins : Il y a peu de choix pour dépenser son argent (manque de boutique), les objets ramasser pourraient être plus variés, avoir plus de chose a vendre. Il y a un manque cruel de pnj.
Mais c'est tout de même le premier VRAI jeu de VR que je croise, pas une démo de 10 min. Bon achat
"
26367191,"Absolutely would recommend this game. 
The VR experience is unlike anything else i've tried before, and this is a MUST buy for anyone who has the Vive. 

The controls are extremely intuitive and very effective at delivering a realistic and fun combat experience. 
The only downside is that i wanted to keep playing once i beat the main quest. 
10/10"
26357851,I bought this game as an early access game with the first two chapters completed. This game is how VR was meant to be experienced in games. I had no expectations going into this game due to lack of promising true interactive games that I have played. The visuals are clear and the controls are very responsive. I could not stop playing this game until I completed it in one evening. It is truely immersive. I hope that other game developers are taking note of the blue print designed with this game.It appears to have been awhile since an update was realeased with new material. I hope the gap means the game developers are working to release a completed version of the game. The price tag on this game is worth it as long as a completed product arrives within a reasonable amount of time.WELL DONE!
26353745,"Fantastic RPG, one of the best games available for the Vive, the new difficulty really makes it a challenge. Ignore the cartoon graphics, this is the game that I gouged my wall (and dented my vive controller) by thrusting at a skeleton while fighting for my life.

Really can't wait for the followup episodes. Though I must admit, if they turned the mining aspect into its own game I'd probably spend far too much time in it >.>"
26342100,"This is only my second review of a game on steam. I have quite a few games for the vive and I have to say this game is the best of the bunch. It looks great, the controls are tight and the enemies are fun. I'm blown away after many hours of play. Great job to this developer!"
26333087,Extremely polished and highly enjoyable. Works beautifully with the Vive.
26332543,"Best VR game in the market right now! At least my favorite one!

First of all, I start this review with the same words as I have done before: English is not my native language. Sorry for stupid mistakes sometimes...

Ok, what do we like in VR game? Yes, interaction and immersion! In this game you have both on so high level that I couldn't imagine before that it's even possible...

This game has the most responsive and awesome combat system. You have to parry, dodge, block enemies' attacks and counter them when they are open. You totally understand when you hit and you get hit. It's so simple, so intuitive and so good!

Interaction with the environment is one of the best! You can burn the leaves on the floor with your torch, you can move and break most of the objects to find some coins or goodies, you can even jump and disrupt the apple from the tree and eat it!!! Next level immersion, guys! Next level...

I can write a lot of warm words about this game and make a lot of compliments... But I just want to hug the game developers and say a HUGE THANK YOU guys! You did a great job!

Guys, don't even look that this game in Early Access... Most of the released games are flawed if you compare with this one in Early Access! Vanishing Realms is most polished and awesome game!"
26324608,"A few minor graphical glitches, but all in all the best VR game on the market right now."
26323622,"My favorite game on Vive. Still a little sensitive to motion, but this game handles it perfectly. Incredibily immersive and shows off the gaming potential of VR. Highest recommendation."
26316844,"效果极好，RPG里司空见惯的翻箱倒柜捡钱用VR的方式亲手去做意外的有乐趣，战斗部分也很不错，攻击招架都很自然。
"
26304507,"Nach den ""äußerst positiven"" Bewertungen habe ich mich für dieses Spiel entschieden. Leider wurde ich enttäuscht.

=======================
Warum ich das Spiel nicht mag:
=======================

(-) Die Kämpfe machen mir persönlich wenig Spaß. Grund: Die Künstliche Intelligenz der Gegner ist sehr schlicht. Selbst Bossgegner stehen immer wieder einfach da und können problemlos aus der Entfernung mit Pfeil und Bogen abgeschossen werden. In anderen Situationen (Nahkampf) funktionieren Kämpfe aber wie gewünscht und machen dann auch Spaß.

(-) Zur Fortbewegung muss man sich in kleinen Schritten durch sehr große Areale teleportieren. Problem: Ständiges Teleportieren ist suboptimal. Es bringt einen aus der Spielwelt, da der Kopf ab einer gewissen Häufigkeit die Umgebung als ""nicht real"" wahrnimmt. Wären die Areale anders gestaltet, würden sich die Teleports pro Zeiteinheit reduzieren. Andere Titel machen das besser. 

(-) Der Höhepunkt des Spiels ist eine kleine Arena. Diese muss man schätzungsweise acht mal durchlaufen, um das Spiel zu knacken. Das Schema ist dabei immer gleich. Beim 3. mal war ich der Arena leider bereits überdrüssig.

(-) Ich habe sehr langsam gespielt und komme auf eine Spielzeit von knapp 3 Stunden. Sehr wenig für 20€, zumal auch viel Leerlauf und Wiederholungen dazwischen sind (=>Arena).

(-) Das Inventar ist fummelig und dort platziert, wo in der echten Welt der Bauch wäre. Problem: Es ist immer am unteren Linsenrand --> Das Inventar ist grundsätzlich unscharf, da außerhalb des Sweet Spots. Das strengt die Augen an.

(-) Schwertkämpfe funktionieren auf zwei Arten: Man tut was das Spiel von einem will, oder man fuchtelt einfach wild und ohne Ziel rum. Leider funktioniert beides.

(-) Wenige Gegnertypen mit wenig ""Charakter"". Die einzige Sprachausgabe in diesem Spiel ist ""hoooooh"". Das geben Gegner von sich wenn sie zuschlagen.

(-) Es existiert leider keine nennenswerte Story abseits von englischen Texttafeln.

==================
Was am Spiel positiv ist:
==================

(+) Die Schwertkämpfe machen durchaus Spaß

(+) Bogenschießen annähernd wie bei ""The Lab"" umgesetzt.

(+) Man kann eine Spitzhacke finden, mit der man Kristalle, Edelsteine abbauen kann. Das macht so lange Spaß bis man merkt, dass es im ganzen Spiel vielleicht 10 Stellen gibt, wo man diese einsetzen kann.

(+) Mancher schöne Aha-Moment im Spiel für Leute mit noch wenig VR Erfahrung.

(+) Es ist ein VR Spiel

=====
Fazit:
=====

Ohne Virtual Reality wäre dieses Spiel wohl nicht relevant. Umfang gering, Grafikstil recht austauschbar, viele Designmacken. Virtual Reality macht daraus dann eine interessante Erfahrung, die aber ausbaubar ist. An anderer Stelle (Rec Room -> Mittelalter zB) hatte ich deutlich mehr Spaß für weniger Geld pro Spielzeit."
26297255,"At first the game seems ok, but when you pickup a sword and start to fight it becomes a whole lot of fun. Especially when dodging fireballs whilst still shooting arrows. 
This game is very polished. 
Highly recommended."
26297002,Great game can get very intense so dont have a too small playing-area
26293921,"Runs great, looks great, feels great. Definitely the best, most gamelike vr-game ive played so far. Only downside is the overall lenght of the game so far. Finished in just about 3 hours. (Havent tried hard mode yet)  Got my moneys worth IMO."
26292825,An awesome game. It gives you a great sense of scale and the combat is great. The replay value is a bit weak but the length of the game and enjoyment factor makes me recommend this. Post the next update soon :)
26288259,"Dies ist eine klare Empfehlung. Vanishing Realms ist das erste Vive-Spiel, das ich gespielt habe und das keine Tech-Demo ist oder nach 1h langweilig wird. Den Reviews auf Steam bei VR-Games traue ich schon lange nicht mehr. Alle scheinen immer sofort begeistert zu sein, aber haben meistens nicht mehr als 1h gespielt. Natürlich ist der erste Eindruck meistens wirklich bombastisch (ist halt VR), aber der Spielspaß läßt oft schnell nach. Das ist bei Vanishing Realms anders. Dazu komme ich später.

Erstmal die Spiele, die ich für Vive besitze und aus denen ich meine Erfahrung schöpfe:

Fantastic Contraption: Könnte für manche interessant sein, aber ich mag das Spielprinzip nicht. Puzzle sind nicht mein Ding.
Job Simulator: Macht ein paar Stunden Spaß, aber kein Wiederspielwert.
MIND Path to Thalamus: Wird schnell langweilig. Stundenlanges Rumgerenne ohne etwas tun zu müssen, aber schöne Welten.
Out of Ammo: Wave Shooter mit noch zuwenig Content, Spielspaß hält nicht lange an
Pool Nation VR: Leider eine Enttäuschung für mich. Miese Steuerung.
The Visitor: 5 Minuten Spielzeit
Zombie Training Simulator: Das ist wirklich gut und macht zwischendurch Spaß, aber leider immer das selbe und zuwenig Content. Trotzdem guter Wave-Shooter.
The Blue: Schönes Erlebnis, aber nur 10 Minuten Spielzeit

Vanishing Realms hatte ich zuerst nur relativ kurz angespielt, bin aber recht weit gekommen (hatte bereits den Bogen). Ich fand es nicht schlecht, aber auf Dauer eher lahm, bis ich mich vor wenigen Tagen intensiver mit dem Spiel beschäftigt habe und noch einmal von vorne angefangen habe.
Dabei ist mir aufgefallen, dass Vanishing Realms vor Secrets nur so wimmelt. Ziel sollte es sein, soviel Gold und Secrets zu finden, wie möglich. Nur dann bekommt man die beste Ausrüstung. Beim ersten Durchlauf konnte ich mir nur das schwächste Schwert und den schwächsten Bogen leisten und fragte mich, wie zur Hölle soll ich an soviel Gold kommen?
Jetzt habe ich festgestellt, dass unter dutzenden Steinen, Büchern, Kerzen,... Münzen versteckt sind. Außerdem kann man Vorhänge, Teppiche, Stroh, usw. mit der Fackel verbrennen und auch dahinter verbirgen sich Secrets. Man kann Kisten, Fässer, Vasen, Sargdeckel und alles mögliche zerschlagen. In den Räumen hängen in den Ecken Spinnweben mit Goldkrügen. Wenn man die Spinnweben verbrennt, fallen die Krüge in Reichweite. Es gibt geheime Orte. Dieser hier ist wirklich super: [spoiler]Auf der Insel, wo man eines der 3 Schwerter kaufen kann, ziemlich am Anfang, sollte man sich alle Inseln drumherum anschauen. Man findet u.a. einen roten wertvollen Krug (ingame Achievement) und auf einer entfernten Insel steht ein Grabstein mit einem Rätsel: Man soll ein Leuchtfeucher auf der Klippe entzünden. Es gibt eine Möglichkeit, dort hinzukommen und hinaufzukletter. Dabei findet man noch mehr Schätze auf dem Weg (Boot). Viel Spaß beim Suchen. [/spoiler]

Man kann und sollte also jeden Stein umdrehen und sich alles genau anschauen. Und bei der Länge des Spiels (es gibt viele Kapitel) ergibt sich daraus eine enorme Spielzeit. Außerdem gibt es ingame Achievements, die man unlocken kann, z.B. Entzünde 75 Kerzen, finde 30 rote Krüge, schiesse 20 Äpfel von Bäumen, etc. Auch das motiviert, alles mögliche zu versuchen. 
Ich habe jetzt mit dem Spiel neu angefangen und bereits wieder fast 2h am Stück gespielt und bin noch weit am Anfang (noch nicht mal da, wo ich beim ersten Mal Spielen nach nicht mal einer Stunde aufgehört habe), weil ich 100% erreichen will und ich habe dabei soviel neues entdeckt. Mein Tipp: Probiert alles aus, untersucht jeden Stein. Man kann z.B. mit Steinen oder Schädeln, usw. Goldkrüge von hochgelegenen Vorsprügen werfen, usw.

Nebenbei sind dann noch die Kämpfe mit Schwert/Schild und Bogen, die auch wirklich Spaß machen und auch da gibt es oft Möglichkeiten, Kämpfe zu umgehen oder starke Feine auf andere Art zu beseitigen. Die Physik im Spiel gefällt mir sehr gut, ebenso der Sound und die Sprachausgabe.

Ihr merkt, ich bin echt begeistert von dem Spiel und ich werde es definitiv weiter und durch spielen. Es ist für mich das ersrte ""richtige"" Spiel für die Vive und keine Techdemo ohne Langzeitmotivation. Ich hoffe, dass noch mehr dieser Spiele entwickelt werden.

Top Spiel. Bestes Vive-Spiel bisher. Klare Kaufempfehlung."
26271578,"What if one of the early Zelda games was a modern VR adventure? You've got your answer.

This is, by a long shot, one of the VR games you CANNOT miss.

It's also made by Kelly Bailey, the amazing musician behind the Half-Life soundtracks.

I also really want to praise the ambiance and atmosphere of the environments, which is REALLY good; in fact, if, like me, you're a Dota player, it feels like it could be a Dota spinoff, in some weird way... (and in fact, not only is the splash art by Jim Murray, but some of the 3D assets are, as far as I can tell, touched up Dota models)

Go for this, without hesitation. It's a great first (or second) step into VR."
26254538,"[A MAGICAL ADVENTURE ONLY SLIGHTLY SULLIED BY THE CLOSING CHAPTER]

This gives me that old, nostalgic feeling. Like playing the first Spyro game on the PS1 - except a hundred times cooler because it's a first person dungeon crawler in VR.

- The controls are very intuitive and natural feeling. I'll roll up to a table, toss all the candles over my shoulder, swipe up all the pennies hidden underneath, and chuck the apples in to my backpacks - and it all feels super smooth. 
- The inventory system works great. I can switch up my equipment on the fly really easily, even the stuff in the backpacks. It was occasionally hard to get in the right place, and I often found that I couldn't access it at all while crouching, but most of the time I didn't even have to think about it.
- Moving is done through teleportation, which is pretty standard for a lot of games. Works just fine for this :) Though I did find that it made dodging projectiles and traps super easy! 
- Some really cool events/encounters and interweaving level design (made me think of Dark Souls, coming back out in a familiar places etc).
- Difficulty curve was just right
- Pacing felt right on too - the first chapter didn't drag on but also didn't feel like it zoomed by!

Something that I really appreciate is that is the ability to play this game with a left handed loadout!
Sure, it automatically wants you to put your shield in your left hand and sword in the right, but who says you need to do that? Swap em over and beat those skellies senseless - southpaw style!


The only thing that I felt let me down was the second chapter.

Chapter 1 was wonderful, and I really felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished it. When I moved on to Chapter 2 I saw this cool environment and I was super stoked about the idea of exploring this sun-soaked, temple-looking place - anticipating further challenge with new enemies and maybe some gear upgrades! Building on the content I'd already experienced.
But then it ended up basically just being a series of arena ""kill the dudes"" challenges and nothing more. It felt more like the kind of thing you'd access from the main menu as a separate challenge mode mini-game. I certainly couldn't call it a chapter.

This does nothing to diminish the fun I had in C1, but I hope that the next instalments are more like that than C2. 

Had a whale of a time and this is still my favourite VR experience yet!
 I'm looking forward to seeing what further content is like ^^"
26251585,"This is, without a doubt, the best game I have ever played in my life. The graphics aren't fantastic, the gameplay is dodgy in parts, but the ambiance, the interactions, and the clever use of the VR space is absolutely amazing. There's a good chance I'm saying this because it was the first adventure game I played in VR, but regardless, it's really a great game."
26249363,"my fav vive game so far, VR is perfect for ffirst person rpgs and this is the best so far, actually couldnt stop playing lol... 10/10 new updates pls!!"
26243809,"YES YES YES. This is the first review that I'm ever writing.

Dungeon Crawling. 
Puzzles.
Riddles.
Art style is beautiful.
Music is great.
Combat is fun.

Lost 2 hours in what felt like a matter of minutes. Amazing example of what VR can be!

10/10 Would buy again."
26240187,"สนุกมากครับ แต่ต้องมีเนื้อที่เยอะๆหน่อย

เกมส์สั้นไปนิด"
26236440,If you have a Vive and haven't bought this.  Stop reading and buy it.  Now!
26225732,I loved loved loved this game! you can imagine my sadness at how short it was. needless to say you have my money for the next game
26208485,"Excellent! One of the best experiences I have had on Vive. The length was completely acceptable and I feel the first two chapters wrap up the launch game adequately. While it obviously continues on with a very exciting teaser moment at the end, it feels very complete."
26197389,"Having played one hour I can say that this was well worth the purchase. I was sceptic at first since many other VR games have come out short of expectations (Including Batman Arkham VR for PSVR), but this one delivers full embodyment of what a room scale VR dungeon crawler might offer. It really felt like going back to a classic like Shadowgate or Eye of the Beholder game - making the extrapolation of what that experience would be in VR. Excellent job by the team behind this game.

HIGHS: The inventory felt perfect! Exploring and putting stuff on fire is really fun. Movement by teleportation feels natural the way its implemented. The most exiting moments so far was related to finding hidden areas and being attacked for the first time."
26196756,"at the time of the Vives release this game was bundled with it for free with 2 other games

being that it was 1 of 3 games that owners likely played for the first time so it was given higher praise  than what its worth

i was amazed to see that this game still shows its in early access at this point in time

for anyone who has see this and the price is still $20 i have to say keep away and find another newer finished game at this time, you could literally get skyrim or fallout4 at this point at a special sale for $20

this game should be in the $5 or less area at this time

expect it to never be finished since dont forget a large portion of the player base already got it for ""free"" so why would the developers continue when mostly everyone already has it"
26193069,"I just completed the the current version of Vanishing Realms.  Outstanding!!  I have a number of fun games, but this, this rocks.  I found myself dodging arrows with my body it felt that real.  I look forward to the next installment and any future developments.  If you have the Vive,  this should be on your games to play list!
"
26192367,Great game... if you are looking for a fun adventure game to play and you have the HTC Vive then I highly recommend this game. It is a fun game for kids and adults.
26192100,"22 October 2016
Closest thing out to a triple A title right now. Imagine playing a Zelda level/dungeon in VR, that's this game. Great level design, responsive controls, very immersive experience. A very polished game. But it now."
26191114,"Oh Wow,
It might be a bit rough some times but there is no game like it. The combat has obviously had a lot of love and attension poured in to it and it shows. Greatly look foward to the next installment."
26188875,This game is one of the most fun RPG's at the moment. I really enjoy the combat and the locomation system. It does have some issues though that i would like to see fixed having a way to push the melee enemies back during combat because at the moment they just stand there and walk towards you if you move back which is a problem with chaparone space.
26187185,"The game glitched and stopped me from progressing, one of the necessary items never spawned, so thats one of the biggest problems I have with it. But even if that item did spwn I still couldn't recommend it. pros/cons:

Pros: Extremely fun and immersive combat
Solving puzzles is actually quite fun for the most part, seaching around a vr room is way more enjoyable than I expected.

Cons: Everything else

To sum it up this is an extremely basic and repetitive rpg only made fun (to some people) by the fact that it is ""IN VR""."
26186030,A beautifully rendered fun romp. I hope there are more chapters to follow.
26174508,Best VR game I've played so far!  Very inspiring.
26171781,"Wow! This is such a great experience. I love the environment, the inventory system, the combat, everything about it is just great to me. I can't wait to see what more this dev adds. 

Like others have said, expect it to take about 3 hours to complete. There is a hard mode that I plan to replay though, so depending on how much you like it you can definitely get some replay value out of it. 

Probably my favorite thing about this game is just how physical it can end up being. By the time I finish fighting a few skeletons, I stop and realize I'm drenched in sweat. It really just pulls you in and you forget about real life. If you have a vive, you need this game."
26164344,"Excellent game! This is the kind of thing us older nerds daydreamed about while playing D&D as kids. Would really love to see more like this for the Vive!

Kudos to the Dev - great job!"
26132623,"Awesome VR Dungeon Crawler, One of the Best VR games I've played.
If you have VIVE headset , This is a [b]Must Have game[/b]
You can play it in smaller room setup vith no problem at all, but everything larger than 2.5x2.5 m is highly recommended for better experience, if you prefer to walk around.Bigger room, Better Experience

10/10 Would Hit a wall with my head again!"
26132417,This is still the best game for vive so far!
26119672,"After playing it 2,5 hours straight after getting it, Ive had a blast and im not through it yet (no idea how far yet to go but more chapter will be added). This game is very good and I can recommend it easily. Get it!"
26119578,"Two hours in, this game is amazing.

The combat is intuitive and fits into the game world. The systems make sense and the puzzles... (so far) have been logical.

More than just a one play VR wonder.

Tests the limits of rooms scale, I constantly want to walk rather than teleport. Compliment not complaint, its that engrossing."
26118838,It's the most complete game experience I've had with motion controls so far. Feels like a proper game that's properly built for the Vive. Superb.
26110598,"Great RPG. Rather easy to begin with, but you are getting used to the control scheme, navigation and fighting in VR, so it's probably better like that. I purchased it today and thought I'd give it a go and wound up spending 3hrs in it straight. Reccomended!"
26107577,"This is why VR will be the future of gaming. Every time I play this, I am so immersed and just ready for the full game. Thank-you for realizing a childhood dream of mine by making this game dev!"
26099882,"おすすめはする。VRでファンタジー世界を歩き、剣と盾、弓と魔法でモンスターと戦えるのだから大変面白かった。物陰に隠れて弓をやりすごしてから飛び出て弓を打ち込んだりしたときは「VR買ってよかったー泣」と思った。しかしわかってはいたが、それにしたって飽きるのが早い。剣と盾の攻防戦もシンプルで、魔法にいたっては一つしかない。1900円代で早期アクセスゲームなんだからそんなもんだろう？とわかっているなら結構。skyrim並みのボリュームを求めているなら返金要請が許可されるギリギリまでプレイするか、買わないことをお勧めする。アップデートも遅れているようだし様子見もありだ。

クリアするまでは楽しかった、、、、、"
26090000,"In a sea of tech demos and ""experiences"", this is the best of them.  If you imagine a fantasy game like Zelda in VR then i bet you just imagined Vanishing Realms.  Its fun, looks gorgeous and technically satisfying to play.  And all this just by a 1-man-dev?  Wow.  Actually that is the only downside.. with a team behind him to enhance and expand the content, he would have a AAA game right here.  And he wouldnt have to work again.. though we all pray he does.  Is that praise enough?  Got a vive?  Get this.  Simples."
26086713,Freaking awesome. Worth the purchase if you like action RPGs.
26079103,9.5/10 - One of the best games for the Vive.  Play Zelda as Link!
26075803,"Vanishing Realms is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. This style of game became one of my favorite genres when the original dungeon crawlers were coming out, such as Bard's Tale and Wizardry in the early to mid eighties. To see that style of game presented so masterfully in a VR environment is simply amazing. This is precisely the type of game I was hoping for when I bought a Vive. Please, more of this! Learning to fight and block your opponents was so well done. One of the most immersive environments I've had the pleasure to visit."
26063928,very very good game must buy
26063752,"[i]Vanishing Realms[/i] is a VR dungeon crawler that sets out to give a glimpse of what is possible in this new genre.

And if you think hand-to-hand combat with undead creatures might be a bit exhausting, you'd be right. This is not a criticism of the game. As a broad first attempt to get swords, shields, bows and magical items into the hands of players who must use them to block, thrust, parry, dodge and aim while maintaining situational awareness, this game succeeds very well.

What VR demonstrates is that this type of action can be tiring and sweaty work. While it isn't [i]Dance Revolution[/i], having a mask strapped to your face while you are flailing around with toy-like 3D weaponry can result in a lots of facial moisture, foggy eyepieces (no ventilation) and tired arms to accompany the silly grin on your face. Fortunately there's an in-game pause button that allows you to take off your headset, wipe your brow and reach for the adventurer's mead (aka Gatorade). [i]Also it's far more deadly to learn a good stance and sweeping motions instead of trying to bat enemies with wrist flicks. You're using a sword, not a fly-swatter![/i]

Given that this is first-gen VR, this game can also be forgiven for it's cartoon-like world. We're likely some ways off from having Skyrim-esque settings in VR, but if you play this and imagine that one day you might be able to fight Draugr underneath some forgotten cairn in the middle of a snowy pine forest, then it's worth noting this game helped get us there.

Story? Meh. You have no real identity in this game and there is no world to discover, just a series of locations and quest objectives. There's a few easy puzzles to figure out. And for the final act you get to do several rounds of timed arena combat (the Rite of Steel).

I recommend this game with reservations. It's clearly one of the front-runners of the current pack of Vive games that attempt to be more than a demo, yet it still feels demo-like: short, no story and focused on introductory mechanics. One chapter is currently available with another promised to complete the game and a possible third as DLC. That might give it enough length to justify the full price if it happens in the near future. The game won't keep this front-runner position for long as other, newer titles inevitably push beyond those boundaries.

[b]Rating: 7/10
A good intro to first-gen VR gaming, but lacking a fully fleshed-out experience.[/b]"
26060917,"What realy sucked me in where you encounter an enemy for the first time. Used to somthing on a computer screen being like 4 inch's, danm thing was 6ft . A little short but well worth it."
26060500,"Lots of hidden areas and loot if you look hard enough, boobietraps and surpises as well.  Combat is Solid for VR and will leave you dodging and swinging tactically instead of a madman. Chapter one boss fight is satisfying and look forward to walking through Chapter 2."
26053685,good game and it can be improve
26049176,"This game needs my thumbs up, so here it is. 95% positive rating (1142 reviews) atm.
One of the best VR games out there. Very immersing and fun to play. I'm hoping for more!"
26049050,"Was a little optimisitc about this game.

This has been the best VR experience I have had yet! 
Totally reccommend this game for the HTC Vive :)

I look forward to a sequel :)"
26017951,"Wow this game is incredible !
I never thought one day play a game like these.
Expericence is great, atmospher, fights, enigmas.
I used to play D&D or other role playing games, and you realized a fantasm: being totally immersed in this universe.
That's why it's my only deception: playing alone is so sad.

Wow ce jeu est incroyable!
Je ne pensais pas un jour jouer à un jeu comme ceux-ci.
L'expericence est fantastique, ainsi que l'atmosphere, les combats, et les énigmes...
Je jouais à D & D ou d'autres les jeux de rôles, et votre création a rendu réel à un fantasme: être totalement immergé dans cet univers médival fantastique.
Voilà pourquoi c'est ma seule déception: jouer seul est si triste..."
26007607,"I take my Vive to my friends' and family's houses and observe as they play.  ""Vanishing Realms"" BY FAR is in biggest demand and gets the most gametime of the couple dozen choices I have for them.  

Note: The players need a chaperone while in gameplay--they get so into this game that they ignore the Vive's boundaries and are soon bumping into the piano, the big-screen TV and plate glass windows.  That doesn't seem to lessen the demand for this game, though. Everybody at the party still wants to play."
26004355,By far my favorite VR game so far. It is incrediably immersive.
26003506,"Short game at the minute, less than 4hrs.   But amazing game play    a must have for vr."
25999399,"One of the best games on Vive! It's like play a real life version of zelda in First Person perspective!! This is a must have for any Vive owner! I can't wait to see more levels added to this game.

25989839,One of my favorite VR titles.  Definitely worth checking out.
25985279,enorme le jeux d`aventure
25971127,"By far one of the best games I've played on Vive.  Great controls, lots of content for the price, battling is done VERY well, and replayability.  This should be in everyone's library if you have the Vive!"
25967889,It took me just under 6 hours to complete both chapters that are currently out. I didn't solve all the riddles and wasn't speed running the game. I do recommend the game.
25962833,"Fun, a little glitchy but extremely short for 20$.."
25959528,"I was just teleporting around and tapping things with my sword... But I had a ""eureka"" moment when I realized I can actually sidestep a blow and counterattack, or walk to reposition myself around a shield, or dive and stab to get through a tough defense. The game is rather easy, however. Steam says I have 1.7 hours played.... That is accurate. I cleared the entire game and trials in 1.7 hours.


UPDATE (August 2017)
Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
“4-8 weeks for Chapters 1 & 2.”

^^ That's a lie. Hasn't been updated since my original review. For the price, I can no longer recommend this title. Buy GORN instead. More action, more challenge, better mechanics, and it has had quite a journey from little freebie tech demo to best game in VR. Sword Master VR is also a good alternative if you want your melee fix (it has the best swordplay in VR at the moment)."
25957923,"Easily the best game on Vive. This is what you bought your Vive for. tring it on Hard now. so good. my wife who HATES all things video games, LOVES this game and actually begs me to play. cannot wait for part 2. will gladly pay for the next game/dlc."
25957133,"Одна из самых полных и интересных игр на данный момент для Vive. Управление/перемещение удобное; боевая система интуитивно понятная; инвентарь и не мешается, и позволяет доставать/менять вещи прямо в бою, но под конец стал перегружен устаревшим оружием.

Добавить бы сюда ещё внятный сюжет и персонажей, и получился бы отличный аналог Легенде о Зельде для VR."
25948272,"Absolutely Brilliant.

I'll never forget that first experience of adventuring in Vanishing Realms the first time I set up my Vive and playing for 3 hours straight, and physically getting 'adventured out' and needed a break.  

This game is the most viable RPG on the vive yet.  It's complete in a sense that you have swords, shields, bow & arrows, mana and health.  Also the developer has introduced a great 'looting' system that gives you insentive and that same 'loot rush' that we all crave from RPG's.  

The Vive and Virtual Reality is stilll by far in it's early days, but  It's games like this, that I can see pioneering the future of quality entertainment on the Vive and VR in general.  Especially RPG's.

Kudos and well done to the developer.  This is the most complete RPG on the Vive yet and you most certainly shouldnt regret your purchase should you buy it.  Out of all the games on the Vive, this is by far one that I'll give 5 stars!

Well done!

and thanks for the adventure! <3"
25931526,"Fun game, but kinda short.  Probably the best example of an RPG yet"
25930770,This is the greatest gaming experience of my life... I HIGHLY reccomend the HTC VIVE and this game!
25922223,"Comic style first person RPG, works great in VR"
25918781,"This may not be the best game to show off to your friends (mainly because it requires a bit of time before you get really into it and get to the good stuff), but this was definitely the best Vive VR game for me to play on my own."
25916980,"This game really justifies the purchase of the Vive headset.  Fun for the whole family.  Even the wife, who HATES video games."
25909483,"I don't usually write Steam reviews, but I just had to this time. This is, hands down, the greatest VR experience I've ever had. I feel like I'm Link in Legend of Zelda. The sword/board duels and the ranged bow fighting are both absolutely incredible. Inventory management can be better, but that can be so far down the priority list of things you notice one you get into the thick of things.

This is an incredible game, and I hope to see more of it."
25875632,So soll ein Dungeonspiel sein - ein VR Traum (jedenfalls für mich) ;))
25875260,"Wow! This has blown me away. My personal favourite VR experience thus far. The world has a great atmosphere and fighting emenies never felt so real. I only wish this about 10 chapters long with a play time of about 15-20. I felt upset when I reached the end, I wanted to experience more. 
If you just got yourself a Vive - like I did - then do  yourself a favour and treat yourself ot this, it's fantastic!"
25862964,"This is one of my favorites so far in VR, its immersive and has enough content to enjoy.  I hope they decide to do a full fledged game similar to this one day.  The landscapes are just perfect for VR!"
25844966,jeu trés immersif le meilleur auquel j'ai joué pour l instant en vr .On se retrouve a se cacher derriere des caisse pour eviter les tir .On rampe literallement dans le salon que du bonheur !
25837648,Short but awesome!!!
25837627,"Easilly one of the best VR games out currently. Not super deep in gameplay, but it's immersive, and fills that RPG dungeon crawl craving. Fighting is very fun."
25833277,很好玩
25830230,"Just got the Vive set up over the weekend, so I'm as new as they come with VR.  Maybe it's because I'm only a few hours into my VR journey and the novelty has not worn off yet, but this game kinda blew my mind. It's a bit simplistic... this is true... but this experience has changed the way I feel about gaming forever.  Like I said... this is one of my very first VR experiences, so perhaps if I wrote this in the future after spending a couple hundred hours in VR experiences, I'd not write so enthusiastically about this... but for now, I love this game.

I'll try to be objective though to hopefully help someone make a decison about whether or not to buy this.   The setting is kinda cartoony and the enemies look a little Zelda-ish, but when engaged in a sword fight with enemies slightly larger then me, the innocence of their looks temporarily fades away and they feel a bit more menacing.  And that cartoony setting has a real sense of scale and of being a real place.   From the slight vertigo I feel looking over an edge to the floor below me, to feeling moon beams soaking into my skin... It all comes together quite nicely. 

The only criticisms I have are that melee combat is a little easy and repetetive.  Block, strike, block strike... it's hard to mess up. Regardless, it's still fun.   And there are other combat options such as a ranged bow which are fun to use.

Another minor gripe is that enemies seems to just stand around and wait for you to approach.  Would be much cooler if they were a bit more aggressive and plentiful.  But then again, for a VR noob like me, maybe it would be a little too fast paced. 

My biggest overall complaint is that I want more. 

But, none of these things stopped me from having one of the best times in recent memory.  I can't wait to see more games of this type!  Bravo! Well done!

So, if you are new to VR like I am and the VR experience is still fresh, I think it's worth the money to try this one. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
25828650,"This game is fantastic!  Still in its youth, but the best form of a live-ish action RPG that I've played yet.  There is no concept of leveling, or skills, you just have gold that you find and you buy weapons with it.  Mana doesn't replenish, but you can increase your stock.  I had a blast with this and the first chapter definitely had a lot more content.  I'd love to see this game go a bit farther to give people some good feel as to what VR RPGs might start off as, but then I'd like somebody to get this guy a team and some cash flow becuase this has the right feel to it.  I felt like a kid with a tonka toy mining stuff and crawling under traps was a lot of fun.  If there was a multiplayer concept this could slowly make itself into a Runescape-esque early game for the VR that paves the way and gets interest started for this type of game.  Buy this game."
25818947,"Daumen Hoch! Bestes Spiel für die HTC Vive. 
Chapter 1 ist aber deutlich besser als Chapter 2"
25816211,"Bottom line: As far as HTC Vive games go, I have mixed feelings about this game. I like it because it's a high-fantasy dungeon crawler. 

I managed to complete the first level. The combat was interesting enough, and I like the fact that I got to try out some melee fighting, bow shooting, and magic via magic wand. 

I found the pacing to be... odd. For example, the first level often felt slow because of the exploration component. At least walking around was punctuated with combat encounters. The 2nd level had a completely different pacing. Little or no exploration, but it becomes frantic because activities are timed. I have a particular annoyance for timed things, and I eventually lost interest and stopped playing this game when I kept failing the time-based challenge. For whatever reason, there just isn't enough payoff in other ways for me to bring the same level of enthusiasm for meeting this video game challenge. I enjoyed Dark Souls 1. I am enjoying my first playthrough of Doom2016 in Nightmare difficulty. I'm not really inspired to meet the challenge in this game, for whatever reason."
25815582,"Výborná hra na které se sice stále pracuje, ale už teď to stojí za to!
Nikdy nezapomenu jak na mě vyskočil první kostlivec a nebo jak jsem vzal do ruky pochodeň."
25812315,"By far my favorite VR experience yet, this is lots of fun, and in no time I was having a blast sword fighting skeltons, then trying to switch to my bow to get archers far away. I can't wait to see the final version of this come out one day, well worth the 20 dollars, and I could get at lest 4-6 hours out if on my own right now!"
25810146,"finished the game (not all achievements tough)

and oh man... ever since i learned about VR i was hoping for a good RPG and here it is!
while wandering around in this world exploring, picking up coins, gems, items finding hidden loot, it feels just right!
i actually started looking into crates and i wasnt even surprised to find even more loot and it all feels so natural,
a very easy to use and easy to overlook and organize your inventory.

pros:
- beautifull and fitting environments
- creates a good mood exactly what you would want out of a vr rpg
- somewhat challenging combat
- makes use of many different aspects that makes the vr experience complete
- one of the more immersive games ive played so far on the vive

cons:
- very, very short, about 2 hours game time and i have explored every corner
- there are bugs (to be expected), but not game breaking
- i feel like you need to do too much back tracking if you want to buy a new weapon, for instance if you want the best sword somewhere at the end of the game its easily a good 5min teleport journey wich becomes very stale very fast
- traps are useless in this game
-no story yet?

nevertheless this is a must buy for people that like a good RPG, its so satisfying collecting coins and mining that i wouldnt even mind there would be more grinding opportunities troughout the game, i could play this game for hours and hours... sadly there is only 2 hours and i almost felt sad when it was over, cant wait for the final game!"
25809385,"In the age of VR Vanishing Reaims is by far a must experience and truly highlights what the VR can really do. Even if it's a very basic game, it still gives enough to make you want more. I can't wait until the next chapter."
25805503,"Good fantasy, hack and slay VR game. Especially the graphics and atmosphere I liked. Fighting mechanics are fun although the bad AI of the enemies make this game more a slot machine then a real fighting game.

Positive:
+ nice graphics
+ fighting is a lot of fun
+ interesting interaction possibilities (e.g. shoot the rope, keys, burning things, climbing...)
+ with 3 hours for one playthrough of the main game acceptable length

Negative:
- I somehow missed any story, a bit more narrative would improve the experience a lot
- final minutes of the first chapter felt empty (as if they are not complete yet)
- i had problems with fighting larger enemies, was always to close
- AI is in general not the best. fighting archers or multiple enemies can be done easy because of this. In general you don't have to engage enemies but you can just shoot or throw at them and they won't do anything."
25804647,Das erste richtige Spiel für die Vive! Endlich!
25800323,"Though I've only gotten 2.6 hrs in this game, it is by far the best title I've played on the Vive. 

Game play is absolutely phenomenal. I thought that I'd be turned off by the teleportation movement (which caused me to hesitate adding this title to my library) but to my suprize it works just fine with it and doesn't seem to break immersion.

Sword play is perfect - better than any other title to date. The bow isn't great but is not bad either. I wish the dev would work more on this mechanic and allow arrows to be drawn and nocked similar to 'QuiVR'. It's awesome to see arrows blocked by the shield poking through the other side. 

Interactions with objects is completely satisfying - from mining ore to breaking containers and glass to lighting curtains, pillows, banners, leaves and spider webs on fire. 


Graphics are top notch for a VR title and everything is absolutely wonderous. The world feels alive and is very interactive. 

The haptics feel dead on and the controls are smooth. Even the auto-pause feature (which irritated me at the beginning) is a nice addition to keep you within the chaperone area and from breaking your controllers. You can turn this off, but I left it on since it didn't seem to break the immersion too much.

I look forward to playing this for several more hours and will be buying the 3rd chapter.

If you've been holding off on this title for reasons of movement or any other reason - just buy it already. I wish I had gotten it sooner."
25791771,"I will spare you the lecture:


BUY THIS GAME"

You may be looking for a more intense game, but this game is very relaxing and well made..

2 hours in...

This game went from relaxing to intense.. in the best ways possible...

AMAZING GAME and a MUST for any vive owners!!!"
25784306,"One of the best games for VIVE. Good gameplay, nice graphics. It is a little short, but a fun time. I feel a sort of arena mode would be great, where you fight increasingly difficult enemies."
25783285,"С виду как обычно простая и неказистая на мониторе, в шлеме HTC Vive доставляющая море драйва и фана в VR битве на мечах, с отличной реализацией самых простых РПГ прошлых лет. И это только начало пути этого жанра в виртуальной реальности, а уже сейчас впечатления крайне положительные!"

25772353,"this really is a great game. I love the smooth simple graphics. the sounds is very good,

The best feeling is when you take on your first emery.  A simple 1 to 1 sword fight, its a amazing.  the immersion feel is never broken one.

This has been my favourite VR game to date.  Better than hover junks, better than starseed."
25760260,yes
25742970,Decent Game. 6 hours of play time? Arena isn't engaging as end game replay content.
25719422,"One of the most immersive games in Steam's VR library so far. The combat is very well done and there's so much content to enjoy. Well worth the $20, in my opinion. If you have a Vive, you can't not get this game."
25715314,"Best ""real"" game that i played so far on the Vive, not being a RPG fan in 2D in the begining i was reluctant to buy this one, but glad i did. Mandatory for anyone that as a Vive, i love it, my wife loves it!
And no you dont need 2m x 2m of space, unless you have giant arms... stop reading, get it!"
25714683,"This game is the closest I have found to actually living in the World of Warcraft system.  I loved the point where I did not have enough gold to buy a Dragon Wand, and lo and behold I found a pickaxe.  I went back through the whole level and mined my ass off.  The immersion is whole, and I found myself standing on a stool to try and reach a chalice on a ceiling joyce, but the ceiling was in the way.  I heartily recommend it!"
25710100,"Brilliant! Like being inside of windwaker! :)

I recommend it as a good example

If you added multiplayer I would pay through the teeth to play new levels with my friends

25704552,游戏体验感相当不错，期待后续内容开发。
25698577,"Ohh, so fantastic.. it`s so really. Thanks for this adventure."
25693966,"Worth every penny, excellent vr game"
25686704,"Great game, easily worth the 20 $ ."
25682968,"The worst part about this game is that it doesn't have 100+ hours of gameplay.

My wife and I just completed chapter one taking turns (3ish hours, I'm a completionist, she's a beginner, we were taking turns). I told her that we were almost done with the game and she became rather sad and told me to find more games like this, as it has clearly become her favorite game. I have far more experience than she does playing games and I had fun too, but I think a reason that she enjoyed it so much is that she found it to be approachable for someone at her skill level.

All in all, it's a great adventure with a lot of promise for the future. I recommend buying it now, and watching the dev for future patches and titles."
25681558,"One of my favorite Virtual Reality games, HIGHLY recommend this game. Think Zelda/Skyrim. Great game!"
25670991,"Such a great dungeon crawler. Good combination of combat and achievements, but the AI isn't terribly difficult. It was really damn fun even without super-challenging AI. I had a friend who came over to try out the VR system. He basically picked up two swords and whipped both around in front of himself to defeat any close combat challenge. Kinda lame :)"
25670263,Probably the most fun you can have with a vive right now.
25667383,One of the best games I've ever played. This game has some of the best feature and gameplay integration that I have ever seen done. Loot? You bet. Intemidating enemies? Yep. Good swordplay and physics? Second to none. I would buy many more games like this from the developer. Keep on keeping on my friend! This game is solid in almost every way.
25663123,Absolutely the best VIVE experience I've had to date. If you like RPGs and you like the VIVE then this game is for you! Very engaging and the controls feel very intuitive. Bring on the next chapter!
25655100,"I love this game. It takes me right back to the 90's style 'forgotten realms' style games, especially with the use of teleportation. 
The combat is fairly simple although I enjoy parrying the attacks with my sword and countering. The graphics are high quality and most things in the game are interactive, just make sure you are not standing next to some hay if you are setting it alight or you will soon die. The gameplay is also fun - I found myself crawling under the swinging sytthes to get passed.

There are a few niggles within the game that I hope the developers will sort out/fix:
The hands are currently orbs rather than actual hands, which is a bit of a let down for a dungeon rpg style game.
Also it would be nice if there could be a controller walk/strafe control option as well as the teleportation.

Overall an excellent game and I can't wait for the full polished game to be released."
25645886,"A well Priced VR game, highly enjoyable and original in style and game-play for it's release.
I have nothing but praise for this developer. I think virtual reality is perfect for the 'dungeons and dragons' explore genre and this was created with that in mind, Not 'real',  just a little 'cartoony' and love-able for the original style. Very atmospheric .
The first chapter is very enjoyable, but the second is lazy in my opinion. The first has exploring and adventuring while the second looks good but is essentially just a wave-based hack and slash that was set on a timer with no sense of storyline or any reason to be thus,  but may now be easier with an update.
I'm hoping for more of the first episode shenanigans.
here's a quick look if you don't already know what to expect:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPIc3e33sDI

Please continue to enhance this game and add chapters... I will certainly be purchasing if they are more like the first jaunt!"
25643409,"This is easily one of the best games available for any VR platform. The feeling that you get from walking (literally) through a dungeon with a sword and shield in hand is something you just can't explain to someone. It's something they have to experience for themselves. It's clear that the dev has put a lot of love and care into this title with significant updates and great level and character design.  Its one of those games where you end up heartbroken when its over, simply because you just don't want it to end. 

If we can get a game with 10+ hours of gameplay in the future, I'd be more than happy to buy a game of this quality at a full VR game price. I have no problem paying for gaming love when devs back their games up as this one clearly is.  New boss battles, new scenery and foes to battle, new weapons? If these components are in a future FULL build of this series and it plays like it does right now, you'll have my purchase without question. Great job on this title thus far. A+++"
25629941,"I do not recommend this game in a vaccum. Read on before marking as ""not helpful"" - it's not Reddit, this is a thought-out user review, not an epic troll on an internet forum.

TL;DR - The game is actually somewhat polished, which automatically puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the SteamVR lineup. However, a slew of disappointing design flaws and the cheese-ability of the combat system do little to justify the pricetag when the game is as short as it is. If you're not too picky and willing to play along, go for it.

Pros & cons:

Pros
-quality artstyle, decent enough ambiance to create significant immersion
-the linear levels work without feeling railroady
-sound effects and ""game feel"" work in VR, picking up coins and striking enemies doesn't feel like a chore
-VR allows exploration to feel more like exploration, and less like a slog
-A few nice and simple environmental puzzles keep the game from being a complete wagglefest.

Cons
-Combat is incredibly easy to cheese. Waggling your sword at an enemy's head essentially guarantees victory. Add in a few quick teleports from place to place on bosses, and you've got a low-effort strategy that can wreck anything without actually playing along.
-No artificial locomotion options. Unless it was some hidden options menu I missed, there was no way of giving the player any option other than teleportation. While TP is a nice default for comfort's sake, there are people who would like to use it, especially in the early days of roomscale VR software.
-It's short as all hell.
-It's insultingly easy, even if you play along and don't cheese fights. The telegraphs are massive, and the shield blocks EVERYTHING with no penalties.
-Melee enemies pretend you don't exist until you're already in striking distance. I was expecting to be ganged up on numerous times by the enemy configurations, and never was unless I explicitly tried to. Even when I was firing the bow+arrow at their friends, they never did anything but look confusedly in my direction sometimes. 
-Exploration yields little, save for a few coins. 

ALL THIS BEING SAID, Vanishing Realms is still one of the best VR games I've played. For most, the novelty of VR outweighs the subpar nature of the game itself. And that's fine, but I still wouldn't recommend this game on its own."
25619190,WE NEED MORE OF THIS
25615047,"Amazing pre update and finished it, new updates breathed so much life into it. Fantastic game"
25595121,Really nice game ! I hope that more content will come soon !
25585307,Esta chulo pero si pudieras desplazarte sin teletranspote estaria mejor.
25580944,Great Game! Compared to other VR games this is a great game.
25578938,"If you like Skyrim or Dark Souls or any kind of dungeon crawl games, just buy this. You will enjoy it. This is easily the most developed game of its kind on VR right now."
25539522,"Easily one of the best Vive games to date. If you own a Vive, this is a MUST have. Anyone that enjoys the idea of battling monsters with very well done sword and shield mechanics...this is for you. Definitely brings me back to the good days of dungeon crawling. I played through it once so far and plan on going back over and over. Again, cannot recommend enough, buy it now!"
25535746,"This game is totally amazing! this is by far the most complete VR game i have played yet, you really go adventuring in dungeons and more, mining, boss fights, it all feels really epic (big bosses are rather scary) if you have a Vive GET THIS, just do yourself a favor and GET IT!"
25520225,Dungeon and slight RPG elements. The first step to RINKU STARTO!
25515581,Pretty fun
25511088,"The game is great! my kind of game explore loot gold purchase weapons progress! 

I HIGHLY recommend this game!

Only game i ever beat twice! Normal - Hard! Hard was much more fun!"
25510219,整个 游戏玩起来非常不错，唯一缺点感觉有点短了，基本一个多小时就可以通关了，希望后续能继续开发新资料片
25503599,By far my favorite game on the Vive thus far. Beautiful to look at and challenging to play. Feels like a Zelda game and allows you to truly engage with the enemy. Definitely worth playing and I can't wait to see the future updates.
25503382,"Still a must-have for any Vive owner. I never get tired of demo'ing this to others, and the great updates continue to give me reasons to play through again myself. Always looking forward to the next expansion patch!"
25502226,"Fantastic game where you actually swordfight giant skeletons, explore mazes, cast magic spells, wield a bow and arrow, mine gold, disarm traps, find treasure, solve puzzles.

It's Dungeons and Dragons, but you get to go into the game.  You aren't rolling dice, you are really swinging a sword, holding a shield, ducking behind rocks to avoid flying arrows.

Not pushing a button so some little guy on screen swings a sword.  Not waggling a controller.  Really swordfighting.  It's amazing.

Think the skeletons look like a cartoon on the video?  Wait till you're fighting one in VR.  They're scary enough!  Unless you are playing this in VR you cannot have the slightest idea how real it actually feels.

One of a handful of games worth getting a VR system for.  This is the real deal.

I can't wait until there are more levels."
25493948,"Finalmente tomei vergonha ontem e fui olhar a fundo esse jogo.
Nunca tinha ido muito longo por que me sentia desprotegido sem uma arma, só tochas.
Conforme fui jogando, mais coisas apareceram e a melhor maneira que consigo descrever esse jogo é ""Old School Zelda game VR""
Só parei por que tinha mais gente/jogos na fila, mas pretendo continuar ainda hoje. 
É um jogo daqueles que você fica com medo de que acabe logo.
"
25493210,"My background: Not a gamer really, have tried and tried, but the only games I truly have enjoyed is Age of Empires 1 & 2, Diablo 1- 3, Silver and Portal 2. I dont like sitting still while playing. So I bought a Vive, and i own 70 titles at this point. Or more. I can´t get enough.

Vanishing realms: This is, without a doubt the best game I have ever played. Yes, there are some things that need to be fixed, and it is still early access. But it is truly astounding he amount of joy I get running through this wonderful Dungeon Crawler! This is the game i dreamt about as a child! Thank you Devs, you are true heroes!


I play on warrior mode, got to sixth rite of passage where I got tangled in my cable and yanked the power cable out of my link box ^^:

Good Stuff:
Swordplay: Amazing! I will not say it cant improve, but holy hell! you guys really put in alot of work compared to any other game I have ever seen. Keep it up!

Ai: Sure, there are still some dumb stuff the monsters do, but the AI in this is sometimes scary good.
Big plus for the trap devs! Got me seriously fooled!

Bow and arrow: Excellent. Just leave it as it is. Maby make it more real and harder still. But if not, its fine as it is!

Gameplay and movement: I enjoy the heck out of it! I don´t mind the teleportation too much, even though it always sucks, your teleportation is the least suckiest at the moment. The game kind of makes up for it in this case :) The story is a little bit thin, but it feels like the devs are working up to something. I can´t wait! I almost got tears in my eyes when i found the new path!

The riddles: They are wonderfully written :)

Bad stuff:
I dropped both my pick-axes accidentally, and both disappeared into the floor or wall or somewhere. Could not find them again. So I had to play a very long way around before I got it all back to where I wanted to be. It´s ok though, it was fun ;) Still, if i drop something, I want to be able to pick it up.

Got some bugs where I suddenly, after teleporting, was standing right in front of a monster that had not been there before. Scared the living smurfs out of me. Only happened once.


Some words to the devs:
Do not make it easier. Do not let people tell you they have to be able to pick through inventory faster or anything like that. Remember, this is VR, make it as you are doing now. So that we have to get physically better irl to get better in the game. Thats the beauty of vr! Don´t you think?

Thank you devs! You are wonderful and I love your game.


"
25488103,"I like this game. Buy this game and play it, noobs."
25482254,"Pros:

+ Really a great experience and one of the longest lasting VR game yet (2-3h)
+ My youngest child has played through the game three times, and still just loves the swordfighting.

Cons:
- Personally I'm not a friend of the teleportation locomotions. I'd prefer a more traditionell movement.
- The graphics and assets are low poly mobile friendly.

Overall about 8/10

Still got to play it once again after the latest update.

Update over one year later. Still early access. Still not finished and I doubt it ever will be finished. A good advice: Please stay away from early access. Nice to get slide movement though! If it's ever get finished I may recommend this game once again."
25480041,游戏不错，虽然还没玩通，但是感觉确实不错，值得买
25468192,First review on steam. I have been hesitant to spend much money on games for the vive for the content to cost ratio. With that said I really enjoyed this game and look forward to more content. Well worth the 20 dollars. It's a throwback to my Dungeons and Dragons days.
25458823,"This game is so cool !
When I first watched the video I thought the game didn't look good and it was not interesting.

But I bought it anyway and I'm glad I did !
Playing in VR is nothing like watching a video of the game.

Being inside the dungeon, fighting with your sword and shield, using your bow and magic...
Playing an RPG in VR is a dream come true !

Totally worth the price !"
25458793,"Omfg, this game on the HTC Vive is AWESOME!!! I haven't even beat it yet and I LOVE it! :heart:"
25451262,"Going to update my review of Vanishing Realms now that Chapter 3, The Sundered Rift has released

Still an amazing Zelda inspired VR RPG. Still an incredible value.

https://youtu.be/M_-wrSKisxg

Visually the game will likely feel dated to most with the low poly and cartoonish look and feel. I personally think that it fits the game and don't have a problem with it. Consistency is more important to me. As soon as I put the headset on I'm immersed in that world and as long as there's nothing that clashes with the rest of the world or looks out of place I'm fairly lenient. IE a 50k poly photo realistic dragon popping out of no where in a low poly cartoony game.

The gameplay is the tried and true Vanishing Realms formula. Some periods of calm with discovery, riddles and gathering interspersed with intense combat. This formula works for me and there are no complains about getting more of it.

I will say, however, that everyone talking in rhymes and riddles can get a bit old having to parse what's being explained. The story elements probably shouldn't be a puzzle but that's fairly minor. It's kind like if everyone in Borderlands spoke like Zer0. I would go from a likeable trait to overkill in short order but wouldn't really impact the gameplay.

There are definitely some issues with the game. This is a single dev indie title. It would be very strange for there not to be issues. The ever so frustrating torch/general grip mechanics for things not weapons. Both the pick and the planks also suffered from this bug that causes the item to constantly be dropped from your hand. I'm not sure how it was being triggered but it was definitely frustrating. Hopefully this gets patched out soon.

The UI/UX at the start of the game could also use some work. It's just plain confusing how you interact with it. It worked and made sense when there was just one chapter but now that we have 3 it really seems to be lacking. Even with my extra large play space, chapter 3s menu was out of my play bounds and easy to miss. There's a lot of room for refinement here.

In the end it comes down to the question: ""Did I have fun?"" As with the original game the answer is absolutely! Vanishing Realms is still a vary unique VR experience even 3-4 years after its initial launch date. Anyone who enjoys RPGs or dungeon crawls should own a copy of Vanishing Realms along with The Sundered Rift

https://youtu.be/3UBhFSrdwpY

An amazing hack and slash that feels similar to titles like Zelda: A Link to the Past both visually and in design. When I put on the headset I feel like I was dropped into one of those dungeons and left to wander. It's a great feeling.

This was one of the first VR games I played and it was amazing in its first iteration. There have been two content updates since then and it's gotten significantly better. 

Combat feels better in hard mode, like you're actually sparring with an opponent rather than smacking a training dummy. I'm loving the Warriors Challenge addition.

I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something melee focused. If you're at all interested in a Zelda VR or Skyrim VR game, check this title out. For 19.99, you get 5-6 hours of gameplay that they're actively expanding on. It's one of the few diamonds in the EA lineup that polished and fun.


Summary:

VR Graphics 10/10
Gameplay 10/10
Audio and Voice work 10/10
Fun Factor 12/10

Locomotion: Point and teleport that has some diminishing returns/stamina algorithm that's hidden from the player.
8/10 (It works very well but I'd like to see an Onward trackpad style movement system as a toggle option in the future. This is my only 'complaint' and is pretty minor)"
25450896,"Great game. Just enough combat and lots to explore.  You have several weapons (sword, shield, bow, wand) and you start off fighting one enemy and once you get use to that it ups the enemys in difficulty and number. I have been playing for about 2.5 hours and I am probably 75% through the game."
25448502,"the most complete dungeon crawler available on the Vive so far, if you're looking for a Zelda like experience, this is it. Recent updates helped flesh out the content, hoping for more in the future"
25443373,"Probably the best game on vive yet.
It feels like a Zelda in VR.

The last update added a hard mode for even more replayability"
25443042,With the newest update this great game just became even better! Love it!
25427271,"[b][i]Vanishing Realms[/i] is an outstanding full-on RPG experience built for VR.[/b] While a vast majority of VR games (at this point) are tech demos, this title really brings the content. And it is done well. Updates are continuous, and things have changed dramatically through the time that I have owned it. 

[i]Essentially, this is a classic RPG with all the regular bells-and-whistles you would expect, only it is for VR![/i] You collect loot, buy stuff at shops, dungeon crawl, buy better equipment, use magic, carry torches, and solve riddles!

[i]Vanishing Realms[/i] excels at being immersive in VR. The dark dungeons and [i]hugggeee[/i] creatures really are impressive, and at times scary, in VR.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+Definatley has meat-on-the bone as far as VR games goes (so many right now are short proof-of-concept or tech demo-ish kinds of deals)
+Very immersive experience
+Constant developement
+Combat is really well done, and definately tactical
+Solid VR control scheme

[b]Cons:[/b]
-I would say this is expensive if it were not a VR game, but thats the VR market

[b]If you have VR and want a solid RPG right now, this should be in your library.[/b]"
25422282,This game gives me a sense of presence like few VR games do. Hands down the best RPG in VR right now. A great new update just landed and more content is on the way. Recommended.
25421679,"This is best dungeon game for Vive currently. For its price is a must buy game.
The room scale experience is excellent,  using motions controllers in great way.
Lot of fun for little money.
If you own a Vive, and have roomscale set - buy this.. and enter the beautiful fantasy world."
25407152,"Outstanding game!
A true ""must have"" for Vive owners.
I'm not even a big RPG fan, although I've enjoyed several ""action RPG"". 
The combat is great. Graphics are beautiful. Pace, atmosphere, audio - all top notch.

It's very impressive that this was an early Vive release yet still holds up as a top title many months later.
More exciting - the dev has really taken EA seriously & EA period is not just about ""bug fixes"".
Latest update adds a LOT - content, fixes, balance, performance, etc.

If you own a Vive, you owe it to yourself to grab this game.
Highly recommend!"
25395043,"Just to clarify, my playtime is much, much longer than it shows in Steam (my wifi was causing me some problems, so I was playing it offline and Steam didn't count my playtime).
I'm now playing it the second time and loving it even more.
Vanishing Realms is probably my favourite Vive game so far. It's pretty much everything I was hoping VR game would be. You feel there. Exploration and puzzles are perfect and fighting is simply amazing.
Yes, it's not very long, but for 20€ it's a steal. Just get it, you won't be sorry.
"
25394204,Das Spiel ist der Wahnsinn.Ich hoffe das davon noch mehr kommt ist genau mein ding.
25392360,"Vanishing Realms sets the bar for room scale VR.  At first go 'round, the length of the overall quest seems short; however, two major updates have brought refinement and replayability.  Even if this was a game you would only play once, it's a must-have for your VR library.  The immersion, game mechanics, atmosphere, and attention to detail are unparalleled to any other game out there.

If you wish to show-off the full potential of room scale VR, this is the game you'd demo to your friends and family.

If you ever dreamed of crawling a dungeon for fame and fortune, Vanishing Realms lets you live out those dreams.

I look forward to the near future when we can all go online into a massive VR world with parties of wizards, dwarves, and clerics to slay the unholy beasts that terrorize our lands.  As amazing as Vanishing Realms is, it is a glimmer in the eye of what VR will be.  That said, it is the most clear and  insightful glimmer you can buy today."
25390898,Burned myself to death by starting a hayfire.. 10/10 would combust again
25389660,"I have to confess I was dissapointed when I played this game. The graphics are so cartoonish that it basically strips away all sense of being in a real world. The fighting was ok, nothing more. Exploration, story and settings was lacking in dept. Not much variation in enemies either. It was one of the few VR games I bought where I actually got bored and just wanted to do something else after a short time. There's so many better games to use your money on, I could not recommend this game."
25380895,"Vanishing Realms is a great game. I love the fantasy, the exploration, the fighting and the riddles. All the elements to entice you back again and again. It really lends itself well to VR and guarantees excitement. I can't wait for more episodes. And well done for including several ""save"" slots so more than 1 member of the family can have a bash.
10/10 Fantastic game."
25376555,Fantastic game for the Vive. Probably the #1 game on my top 10 list. It's got depth and actual gameplay. Me and my girlfriend are playing the hell out of this. Wish there was more chapters or generated dungeon with skill tree of some kind.
25375949,"Really funny game, buy if you have a vr headset"
25373923,"I bought the Vive solely on the hopes that games like this one would come out. It is beyond INCREDIBLE for an early access / WIP game. Honestly, buy this game right now ! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
25373347,This is THE BEST Vive game. It's the closest thing you'll get to Zelda. It's very immersive and a lot of fun. It's a must-buy.
25371418,"This is what VR is all about. Most other games for VR are just rehashing of existing game play while only a few give you a true sense of being ""in"" the game. If more developers would follow this style, VR will go a long way. If developers keep giving us seated experiences that make people sick and aren't much better in VR than playing on a monitor, VR will be just another fad that will fade. More games for VR should be like this one. Absolutely amazing job they have done on this game and I can't wait for the future as they learn from this game.

One frustration is the save game location. When you die, it appears to take you two saves back instead of the last save point. This means having to redo steps, puzzles, etc. over again that you have already done between the last save point and the previous save point.

And two handed axe is worthless in my opinion. It is harder than a sword and shield, so don't see the use when you get killed faster and don't do any additional damage versus the sword and shield."
25371269,I'm not even a fan of this genre but I'm a big fan of this game. The first time I had to sword fight on the Vive was a memorable panic-filled joy. This is definitely worth it's asking price and can't wait to see more.
25364506,"Playing Dungeons & Dragons on Intellivision in the '80s, through the slew of JRPGs in the '90s, all the way up to Skyrim; Vanishing Realms plays the way I always dreamed of experiencing those other worlds. It is just pure immersive fun. I can't wait for the next piece of this adventure."
25362962,"I played through this before the last update, and it was fantastic. Now after the last update, with all the additional content, it is even better. The exploration is great, interesting locations and different enough environments. But what is really important in this kind of game is the combat, and it is excellent. The new AI seems better (the skeletons don't just stand there and let themselves be hit with arrows) and sword fighting, parrying and blocking, jabbing and slashing, is so much fun. If you like dungeon crawlers, fantasy, role playing, hell if you have a Vive, buy this game. It is great."
25360996,"Bereits vor dem Update 2 war dies _das_ Dungeon-RPG schlechthin für die Vive; mit dem Update ist es noch besser geworden und dürfte für eine ganze Weile die Referenz bleiben.  Viele intuitive Interaktionsmöglichkeiten, zumindest auf ""Hard"" durchaus anspruchsvolle Kämpfe und eine tolle Atmosphäre.  Unbedingt kaufen!"
25358976,"Just finished the game, and will probably go again tomorrow on the new Hard setting.

Simply the best game curently available for the Vive.  Supports complex yet intuitive movement, strategic combat, has main- and side-plot achievements, and it looks amazing.  

I can't wait for more chapters, more enhanced mob AI, and other updates as they become available."
25353999,"A perfect RPG. Thanks to the developer, i love this game !"
25348760,"Excellent purchase, highly recommend the game with my somewhat limited play time on ""Update 1"" rather than the ""Update 2"". With all the added features and improvements, I can only see this game getting better and definitely worth $20.

It took me around 2 hours to go through the first two chapters, on what is now considered easy mode, and it was the most immersive experience I have had with the Vive to date. It gave me a feeling of nostalgia as I appeared in the first area, having grown up playing Zelda: Ocarina of Time, among others, the graphics and models remind me of OoT in a good way.

The plans to make future story addons paid is fair as it is clear the developers are focused on perfecting the core game, the first two chapters, before moving on to new content. I will likely be purchasing the new chapter upon release."
25345903,"You don't have to play an awful lot of this game to know that it is well made, fun and an absolute must for any VR player. Considering this is still in Early Access it is leaps and bounds above so so called finished games out there for VR. I own a Vive (obviously) but I really hope that when the Rift get motion controllers and free movement that they somehow get to play this as it needs to be tried by everyone.

Just had a second major update which I have yet to try so I will update this as soon as I can. I wholeheartedly recommend this game."
25341198,"8/10

I really likez it."
25338730,"This game is a must play for anyone with a Vive.  The graphics are cartoony, but it nails the feel of walking around a spooky dungeon, finding weapons and fightining skeletons.  Not a horror game, but it manages a few surprisingly creepy moments.  The combat generally works well - enemies react appropriately when you hit them or block their blow, and the vibration effect adds a nice tactile effect that works better than I would've expected.

I'm not sure why the requirements for this list a Core i7.  It runs fine on my system with a Core i5 (4670 at 4.2ghz)."
25337365,Loved the first update but it was too short. The second update (just came out) adds more content and the monsters feel a bit tougher than before. I can see them watching my blades and trying to figure me out. First adventure wore me out. Will go back and continue soon. GET IT!
25336728,"This was one of those magical first VR games, if a little short lived. But since this update, it's about 10 times better, just for the new AI in hard mode alone. It feels more like a real sword fight, working up quite a sweat! Yeah, real adventure."
25335471,"Cool little game that let's you experience dungeon crawling and fighting skeleton monsters and such. Had a lot of fun playing this game, and it was an awesome experience. Would recommend buying this game and trying it out for your self if you have a vive. 

Some negatives is that the graphics are not that good (although I like the cartoon art style) The combat can be a bit hack and slash, with just spamming the swords left and right.

All in all, I think this is worth playing at this early state of VR. Not a tripple A game, but still realy fun.
"
25335038,"TL;DR: Did you enjoy Conan the Barbarian? Do you enjoy medieval fantasy? Have you ever enjoyed playing (or been curious about playing) a D&D game? If yes to any of those, buy this game.

More info: 
I've played (and owned...barring a couple refunds) about 36 VR games at this time and this game is easily #2 on the Best VR Games list. It's beaten by another game (Call of the Starseed) only because I love story games more than I love medieval fantasy D&D action adventure games--which is exactly what this game is.

If you've ever wanted to live a D&D campaign in real life, as of this writing, there is no VR game that will get you closer. It's medieval fantasy brought to life. 10/10"
25333789,"Wow! If you have a vive, this is a must have!"
25332817,The newest update improved this game in so many ways! Now we just need some new levels
25329291,"It's like Zelda but in VR !
One of the best VR game so far."
25327857,One of the best games I've played for the Vive
25326426,Vive. This. Best game experience I think I've ever had. LOVE IT!!!
25326210,Best RPG/dungeon experience in VR
25325298,"Vanishing Realms ist ein super witziges VR-SPiel in FPV. Genau diese Art von Spielen habe ich mir beim Kauf der HTC Vive vorgestellt. Die Kämpfe sind nicht allzu schwer und ich würde mir eine Bewegungssteuerung a la Joystick wünschen (das teleportieren bringt doch einen gewissen Bruch in das Dive-Gefühl). Die Umgebung ist vielfältig und ausreichend groß. Weitere Quests sind natürlich hoffentlich in Arbeit. Es gibt außerdem eine gute Auswahl an Waffen mit einem sehr geschickt integrierten Inventar. 
Ein Must-Have für VR-Spieler!


Da vor kurzem erst ein größerer Patch kam, muss ich die oben genannten Aussagen bzgl. Schwierigkeit usw. nochmals testen."
25318248,"There was only one thing wrong with this game.  It was only two chapters.

While there was a few things that could be nit picked, textures are a little low, and the polygon count is as well.  I am not one of those people that needs amazing graphics to enjoy a game, and enjoy this I certainly did.
It rewards you for exploring your environment, and encourages exploring in a VR sense, looking in things and under things and around things...
Sword play is not the hardest thing, but for first gen VR stuff it is Very well done.
I would recommend that you pick this up, you will have a lot of fun, even if it does leave you wanting more."
25317025,"It took me about 2 hours to complete in one session and for the first time playing, but it was very immersive and does a great job of showing what the tech is capable of in action-RPG-esque games. I definitely recommend it. Looking forward to the next episode. Great job, Indimo Labs!"
25316271,"Fun VR ""RPG"" that really showcases the platform's potential.

It's not super long - I think I got through it in a couple of hours of laid-back exploration-heavy play, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

It starts pretty slow, but keep going. It picks up.

"
25305471,"Oh my gosh, This is THE BEST VR GAME EVER.
Since you incorporate magic teleportation isn't odd, it's kinda natural. 
Stabbing and blocking are ""easy"" enough to be fun but ""active"" enough to be challenging. Plus the difficulty seems scale-able by adding more enemies like they prove in their proof of concept proving grounds on the second level. 

The fact is that you can start to become a bad ass by teleporting up to a skeleton and stabbing him in the face. 

This game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. It does not need to be improved graphically to be more fun. 
The only thing it needs is more content and story. PLEASE rush this out. Consider multiplayer too, that would be so AMAZING. I would personally buy all of my friends VR systems if you made this game multiplayer!

Thank you for creating this experience."
25286111,"Bought it for the sole reason for supporting the developpers.

And I will continue playing later when it is more polished.

So please don't dissapoint me dear developpers !"
25281672,"What a great first go at a Zelda/Fable type Adventure game. It's a simple romp with some cool looking baddies that actually freak you out the first couple times they get close. The combat it pretty fun too. I was swining away looking for soft spots to hit as they tried to parry my swings. It was fun. I loved the world. 

The only thing that troubles me is that there hasn't been any updates since April. For $21 this game is definitely too short. I did see some chatter from the dev a couple weeks ago so maybe it's just taking more time to polish up the rest of the content. I am not a developer so I have no clue how long things actually take. Probably even longer than a handful of months... Here's hoping. 

If you want to support a great start to the VR adventure genre, play a short but very entertaining beginning, and help a VR developer out then this game should be in your VR library."
25271849,Pretty short and was left wanting more but still worth it for the experience.
25260268,"This was a fun 1.5 hours :)

It remind me of the old Might and Magic which you click foward to skip a frame forward, (as when you teleport, its give the same feeling).

Combat was okay, a bit repetitive and easy toward the end, but still interesting.

For the price the game is worth it in my opinion."
25259357,"easily one of the best VR experiences available right now, and has been since the beginning."
25217642,"Great game!  If you like RPGs, you'll like this game.  I just wish it were longer!"
25195347,This is one of the most fleshed out games on VR with the basic mechanics sorted and the graphics at an acceptable level. No Skyrim or Witcher but definitely one of the most promising games to grace steam at the moment for VR.  Well worth supporting.
25185518,"[b]A great proof of concept so far.[/b]

While it's certainly rough around the edges so far and the second part is little more than an arena, it's great to see how well a sword & sorcery type of adventure works on the Vive.

You move around teleporting and you have your two controllers as hands to which you can equip various things. There's no limb severing or anything like that, but the sword fighting was especially satisfying. The main trick is to block and punish. Blocking can be done both with a shield and a sword. Arrow/ranged combat isn't as refined as in other games like the Lab or Trickster, but it serves its purpose well enough. Plus Vanishing Realms is more of an actual game than either of those two as it stands already.

I hope future versions will get a bit more finesse and depth to the combat, enemies other than just skeletons, and that the future maps will be more akin to the first one rather than the second. As far as VR games go though, this is well worth the price compared to a lot of the other non-free VR ""games"" out there on Steam."
25167673,"Can’t wait for more, but the episode needs to be much cheaper!
But if they are, I will bye every last one of them!
"
25166744,"A great experience that feels complete. Too short for the price tag, but that's typical of Vive games.

Combat feels absolutely perfect. Swordplay is nothing short of awesome."
25165306,Great dungeon crawl.  Can't wait for more content!
25162371,现阶段能玩到这样的游戏，太棒了
25141506,"This is the first high-caliber RPG / fighting game for the Vive, and it's fantastic. Highly polished, scarily convincing in some moments, but accessible even to non-gamer sorts. Visuals are breathtaking; music is understated but suits the game well. Runs flawlessly on a lower-end graphics card (Nvidia GTX 970). There's only 1 chapter so far, but it's long and diverse enough that your money is still well spent, and I expect more chapters will be coming soon.

For the devs - I'd enjoy replaying this game for easily 3x as long if some features like the following were added:
- Scalable ""hard modes"" where enemies have more HP, attack faster, hit harder, etc.
- ""Random mode"" where additional enemies pop up in random places, forcing the player to be more creative & careful"
25139476,"This review pains me very much to make, but I feel like it's required. The game is currently standing at 20 dollars off of sale, with less than 2 hours of content, low quality animations, and other small problems.

I was able to beat the game (without a walkthrough, collecting most items I could, and not knowing how long it was) in less time than steam gives you to refund a game.

Even with not recommending this I really did love the game! But with such a short story at such a high price, I would only recommend people pick this up when it is on sale for 5-10 dollars.

However this game is in early access so it may be updated later on with more content, I'll replay it when that happens."
25127917,"That was the first time I've felt like I've played an actual game, that happens to be in VR.  It's only an hour but worth it."
25124304,"BUY THIS NOW. It's super fun, like Zelda! I love it. WAY TO GO DEV TEAM!"
25111251,"Vanishing realms was the type of game (RPG) that I wanted from the vive. I must admit I had to buy a new pc and the vive within the past 2 weeks having never even tried a vr game or any type of vr experience for that matter and once I was all set up I spent 200$ and downloaded over 40 vr games and as amazing as some games are they just weren't the genre I was into. The I took a shot at vanishing realms and this was it. Although the content was very limited it shows just what can be done in room scale vr. The hand to hand combat,shooting arrows,finding keys to doors and mixing up concoctions in vr is just a dream come true to me. This game looks good and works great. The first time I was confronted in the game by a 15 foot tall enemy I literally wasin awe of its size and forgot to strike back at first. Can not wait for the polished version with more content.!!"
25105499,"Ah, Vanishing Realms; or as I like to call it: “Drywall Hole Creation Tool.”

The 1st level is about as good as it gets when it comes to making you lose yourself to the world that a game designer has created.  The graphics and artwork are very WoW style colorful, and the game itself is VERY immersive. More than once I would find myself so lost in the environment and graphics I wouldn’t notice the chaperone and would literally punch a wall in an attempt to stab a monster.  That’s Ok.  My girlfriend is good at drywall.  

Thank the gods because I’m a nerd not a contractor.  If I can’t fix it with DAP it isn’t getting fixed.

The 2nd level is a wave fighting arena mode.  It’s not as good.  I found myself slogging through it to just see what happened in the end.  It wasn’t boring.  It just wasn’t what I had hoped after seeing the epic RPG of the 1st level.

The ending…well…that’s something to behold. 

Overall this is well worth the early access fees because I can see it going up in price (And still being worth it if they continue what they have in the 1st level on subsequent levels to come.)

Pros:
•	Colorful graphics
•	Neat art design. It will remind you of WoW but has a style of its own.
•	Immersive gameplay that will have you hunting up solutions to puzzles, and fighting bad guys around every corner.

Cons:
•	Your drywall will suffer if you are in a smaller play area.
•	Your girlfriend will get tired of patching drywall.
•	The AI is pretty dumb.  The bad guys were fun to fight but I never felt really threatened or like I had a chance of getting killed.
•	No locomotion options besides teleport.  I realize this has been a common design choice because of how many people don’t have their VR legs, but those of us who don’t get nauseous really appreciate having the ability to move a bit more naturally in a game like this.

Overall: 8/10. Would get drywall dust on my knuckles again.
"
25094662,"This game is great, like vanilla WoW great. Nothing compares to date to provide a more immersive and unique experience. It is one of the few games worth the price and even more so if it were longer.

Let me start by saying, I do not own this game and have not reached the end. However, I played for approximately an hour and a half (felt like 15 minutes) at a friend's house. I would like to own this game, but having played most of the way through it I can't justify the price today other than for developer support (which is why I'm writing the review, seriously this guy is amazing.)

Pros:
Worth the price!
Active developer, more content imminent
No big brother looking over dev’s shoulders pushing timelines and features that will ruin the experience (ahem, Battlefront I'm looking at you)
Boss mechanics done well
So darn immersive, it's inexplicable
Polished to a sheen

Cons:
Short
Costly for early an access title

Other thoughts:
A texture update couldn't hurt
Difficulty settings would be welcome
For some reason, I didn't want to play out until I read reviews (perhaps a better trailer or world tech demo would help with that)
Choices for movement style, currently only teleporting (works well, but not the best for full immersion I feel like a Virtuix Omni and more content would destroy my life for a while like Final Fantasy 7 or Goldeneye 64 did)
Multiplayer arena could add many many hours of replayability

This game IS the bar. Thank you dev for helping to make reality vanish."
25083127,"OMG. This is one of my favorite games so far!!!!
it was my best VR experience. 
*Do not estimate the cartoony skeletons..they are not just cute little cartoons..
when they are (more than)6 feet tall and coming at you to kill you..
it's pretty scary ...
here is my game-play review
맙소사, 정말 제가 좋아하는 게임중 하나입니다!!
최고의 VR 경험이었다고 말할 수 있어요 
+만화같은 해골들을 무시하지마세요...그냥 귀엽고 작은 만화가 아닙니다

"
25073672,"Wow! What a great game. I am looking forward to new chapters. Love the fact that you cannot walk through walls or off cliffs, etc.. The auto-pause feature is great too and I'm in a room slightly smaller than the minimum and did not have too much trouble. I did not find any bugs! Great job so far. I would like to see more hidden items and I'm always hoping for secret rooms with hidden buttons or triggers. I found the monsters a little too easy to kill especailly if you just hang back and hit them with unending arrows. Maybe there is a difficulty setting that I missed or I sugest adding one. Enemy projectiles could go a little faster. Maybe the sword skeletons could block arrows better. Another idea would be more loot from monsters depending on how you kill them. ie skeletons give no loot with 100% arrow damage. It would be a nice addition to add armor, magic rings, more weapon variety, etc.. so you can do more upgrading than just buying a better bow. I always enjoy searching, buying and selling items in RPG."
25040487,"Honestly the best of what Vive has to offer currently. This is what you brought the Vive for and what will convince all your friends they need one as well. It's especially well done considering it was developed by one person shop (albeit a veteran of the industry). Not very long, in fact, it's really short (just 2 hours for me), but importantly it demonstrate what VR system is truly capable of. Before Vanishing Realm I didn't think VR game can be played for long gaming sessions, afterward, I can totally see myself playing something like this for several hours at a time."
25037557,"Really fun and immersive - I spent over an hour without even realising how much time had passed. The sword combat is perhaps the best part of the game as it requires you to think about what you're doing and how to attack - you have to aim around bits of armour, for example. 

I also had quite a bit of fun with the bow and arrow as I would pull back the arrow whilst in cover and then teleport out to shoot an enemy. I have yet to try the wand!

I would definitely recommend this game as one of my top 3 games to get for the Vive as it's sort of the base line for how games like this will be from now on - in the same sense that Half Life is the basis for all modern shooters, this game and its mechanics will be the basis for all future action/adventure titles. Lots of fun!"
25024055,"After playing most VR titles over the last month I have to say that this is one of the best.
Great graphics and atmosphere (the screenshots really don't do justice), intuative controls and great gameplay.

If you own a Vive then you should own this game, simple as that.

I see a few complaints in reviews about the teleport system, but its really not an issue as the play area is so large it gives enough scope to walk about and collect stuff/fight stuff.

I'm trying to limit my play time on this to a little each week as I really don't want the game to end.

Great job devs, please keep it coming."
25018657,"short game, but very very fun. the skeletons look kinda cartoony, but not gonna lie, when they are 8 feet tall and coming at you, it can be a little intimedating."
25004225,"This is genuinely one of my favorite games I've gotten on VR. There's nothing more fun and amazing to experience more than actually sword fighting a skeleton. Even though the game is incomplete, I've still found it to be boatloads of fun for me and my friends and cannot WAIT for the game to continue!"
24988297,"Honestly, the best implementation of a dungeon run in VR that I have played.
Also: Good innovation in inventory management."
24985944,Really fun VR game that gives you a strong sense of being in a dungeon. Combat is great. You will find yourself dodging and ducking. The only thing that got old was the teleportation traveling when I backtracked near the end. It was fine going forward since I did that slowly to be ready for enemies. Highly recommended!
24984418,"Its short, but entertaining. I think the price is steep for what you get. This is a $10 game."
24960638,this is a vr game that really shows what potential vr has and if it was a complete game a would gladly sacrifice the same money as for a AAA game and as it is now it's all the money worth!
24958851,perfektne prekonalo moje ocakavania len dufam ze to nebude len 20 minutova zalezitost zatial som zabil toho krala a ide dalej tak uvidime :D ale aj tak 10/10 odporucam pshodila bi sa  cestina na to nie kazdy vie dokonale anglicky

"
24943856,"One of the most complete games / experiences available for Vive on Steam. Don't really have any complaints.

Well ok just one. A longer teleport range...
Well ok just one more. The inventory icons / UI that hangs around your hips tends to lag behind your movement. Definately not a game breaking issue BTW.

If you feel like every game you have tried on Vive is just another tech demo / unfinished product I would suggest checking this out! Combat can be fun, swords, shields, bows, and wands all feel really good so far anyway...

Looting is fun and so is mining."
24943153,"While initially splendorous at the joys of an RPG in VR, it turns out to be quite short, the mechanics fairly clumsy, and the porting ability extremely finicky. The battles have less to do with skill and more to do with gently waving your hand at necks. I enjoyed it as a looked forward to things to come, but not particularly for $20."
24942629,"Meine bisher Intensivste VR Erfahrung, Absolutes Must have!"
24941726,Great game! Hoping for lots more! This is a 10/10 experience!
24940486,"This game shows a lot of promise, but the creator has done nothing to deliver on that promise and the project seems to have been abandoned (with the last update being almost 4 months ago as of the writing of this review) . This product is not currently worth the list price, but I will revisit my review if the creator ever updates this product.

Edit: I finally got a chance to check out the changes. The game was okay at launch, but hasn't aged well (even with the updates). The gameplay is hollow and does not have meaningful tactical choices. The AI is predictable and easily exploited, which makes combat dull. Chapter 1 has some decent puzzles and the exploration is fun. Chapter 2 feels lazy and tacked on. If it were $5 or $10 or if the Vive was still new and had few quality game choices, I'd recommend it. I just don't think it's worth the price right now, and the creator has said that further content will likely be paid DLC."
24938397,"Graphic a bit simple, but nice. Gameplay is very addictive. Should be in top 10 for HTC VIVE."
24936193,"One of the first complete games for the htc vive.

To finish the game takes about 3 hours.

It has some adventure and rpg elements inside.
You can do swordfight, you have a bow and you can do some magic.

The atmosphere and feeling in this game is quite ok."

24930178,"Favorite VR game!

Game play is amazing, graphics are great, and inventory systems is inovative. 

Can't wait for more frm this company!"
24921020,"this game stands apart because it's not just another ""Stand there and shoot at waves of things"" VR game.  I felt like I was really on a quest finding cool weapons and treasures as I battled the undead monsters that stood in my way.  

There were moments where the room scale movement was incredibly immersive.  I liked to teleport to opening to a cave, and actually walk the length of my room scale, through the twisting cavern, with my sword in one hand and shield in the other.  

This is the stuff that I dreamt of doing since I was a kid.  

Combat is great, since you have to actually block the incoming blows with your weapon or shield, and strike at the unprotected areas of your enemy, otherwise your blows will glance harmlessly off.  

The only downside is that the adventure is a bit short.  A few hours of a story and it's over too soon.  I can't wait for more VR games like this one!"
24920537,"Thanks god i found awesome game !! 
Super like love it !"
24912724,"Одна из лучших игр для Vive на текущий момент. Обязательна к покупке. Далее подробности:
плюсы:
- богатая и вылизанная механика игры (пока только тут реализовано неплохое фехтование с парированиями и целенаправленными ударами, есть стрельба из лука, использование щита, оружия в каждой руке, немного магии);
- есть неплохие загадки и сюжет;
- достойная графика с приятным освещением;
- есть секреты, побуждающие к исследованию мира;
- есть инвентарь и лут;
- тут даже можно стрелу мечом отбить (!);
минусы:
- на момент написания обзора она достаточно короткая (доступна пока только первая глава);
- нужна площадь около 1,5х2 метра минимум, иначе сложно будет предметы подбирать из труднодоступных мест.

Итог: игра обязательна к покупке, с нетерпением жду следующих глав."
24903990,OMG! This is so cool! Must have if you own a Vive. This is what makes VR gaming the future!
24897173,Great game so far!
24897061,"This is my favorite VR game, hands down.  It's like stepping into the Legend of Zelda.  Can't recommend enough."
24877636,"Un peu moins de 2h de jeu sans se presser ! Mais un jeu indispensable pour la VR, sur le HTC vive c'est tout simplement parfait !"
24868834,"I really liked this game, It was the first fantasy RPG game I found on the vive and it didn't disappoint. I found the gameplay balanced and enjoyed the combat. Don't expect a AAA title, expect an indie experience from a dedicated developer. A+ work."
24847561,Great game to demonstrate what the vive can do.
24841079,"This game is absolutely fantastic! There is nothing bad to say about it! I really hope to see more content added to this game or other games like it! Do not hesitate with this one, one of the best VR experiences I have had yet...and I have had quite a few!"
24831631,Would recommend to anyone loking for a fun VR experience. Several games try to do this kind of set up but this is the only one that does it right. Can't wait to see what else they make for this game!
24828899,"really nice VR experience but feels more like a demo than a game

I had completed it in 85 minutes, definately not worth the pricetag, I can only blame myself as the dev has clearly stated there is only about 2hrs gameplay but i cant justify £15 for 85 mins and it left me feeling dissapointed and wish id saved my last pennies this month for something different.

environments are great, i think this is a great game to demo to VR to people.

The enemies wont move until you get real close, lots of improvements could be made to the AI but it is one of the more graphically impressive vr experiences at the moment. The fighting is a bit simple, its just hold up the shield and poke the enemy in the face at the same point each time they attack.

The inventory system is cool but not really needed as the game is so short you tend to have completed it before you needed to eat any of that food you collected.

It has atmosphere, great environments, the enemies are the worst part of the graphics, a bit cartoonish compared to the scenery but its oh so short!

Overpriced for the content so it gets the thumbs down from me unfortunately but if money is nothing to you its a good little romp.

Would of liked to give this the thumbs up but its just not worth the price..."
24828039,"I'm utterly blown away by Vanishing Realms. I've had the HTC Vive hooked up for a few days, and had sampled a bunch of games and demos, and some were really impressive. A few even had moments of ""I really felt like I was there."" But, Vanishing Realms, for me, sustained that sensation for the whole hour I spent with it. 

The combat was surprisingly visceral. The setting and mood were evocative. I couldn't always tell which items were available for interaction, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment.

Overall, after almost four decades of dungeon crawling from Temple of Apshai up through Skyrim, with Vanishing Realms I finally walked through a crypt and slew skeletons."
24820778,A lot of fun. Leaves you wanting more.
24818992,Astonishing that only one developper did this.
24818438,"Juegazo, inmersión total. Lo que soñaba yo hace 30 años cuando jugaba con mi  Spectrum . 

¡Madre mia como lo estoy disfrutando! 

Lástima que ya dicen que es muy corto. De todas formas una experiencia que no te puedes perder si te gustan los RPG. Sí puede ser algo simple ¡Pero esto es el comienzo!"
24816427,"Шикарно.

Полноценная РПГ, а не аттракцион-обрубок, да еще и с интересными механиками.

В целом, пожалуй, больше всего это похоже на классические РПГ в те времена, когда они только зарождались:
Линейные уровни, простенький сюжет, предсказуемые атаки мобов, секреточки, мана-хп-деньги в простейшем их проявлении, какие-то сторонние необязательные действия(Вроде покопать руду ради лишних монеток), ну и прочее подобное, никаких эксперементальных фишек, новых взглядов на вещи и тому подобного тут нет. Пожалуй, будь бы она на мониторе, с обычным геймпадом в руках — это было бы скучно

Но, знаете, когда ты своими собственными руками отбиваешь стрелы, уходишь в сторону от атак, проползаешь под качающимися ловушками - это совсем другие впечатления. Надеюсь, что эта игра - если не очень большой, то точно твердый шаг на пути к хорошим VR проектам
Увы, тут есть некоторые проблемы, от которых никуда не деться — тут неVRный дизайн уровней, из-за чего впечатления несколько затираются, а битва с боссами проходит по схеме ""телепорт-удар-телепорт""(Ох как я бы хотел попробовать поиграть в комнате хотя бы 5мх5м) а сам VRный интерактив довльно слабоват(От казуальной механики боя, до упрощенных взаимодейсвий с окружением).

Еще хотелось бы отметить два момента:
Во-первых, это приятная темная цветовая схема, от которой не сильно устают глаза, а во-вторых очень простенькая(На приятная графика), благодаря чему требовательность к железу у этого проекта не слишком высокая.

Думаю, на данный момент - лучше вы не найдете, а при такой цене — однозначно советую."
24809348,"I thought this was fantastic.  A really good example of what the Vive can deliver.

Like most VR material, the graphics and gameplay are pretty old school.  But what they lack in graphic detail and complexity, they make up for in immersion.

The environments in this game have been generously put together with a lot of interactivity.  Try banging your sword and shield together for example.  A number of the interiors are a pleasure to walk through and explore and had a good balance of things to do and puzzles to solve.

The story line is simple - again, old school, but your first interaction with a skeleton warrior - right there - in front of you - trying to kill you, is something you can only experience in VR, and this game does it well.   The fighting has been beautifully realised.  Particularly the sword and shield combat.  I found myself sweating after a series of hack and slash encounters.

Teleporting has been done well in this game too.  I found it produced no discomfort or nausea.

I struggle to come up with any negatives other than those limits which are imposed on any VR material at the moment - ie lower graphic detail and game length.

Looking forward to the next chapter.

24762386,"This was a fantastic VR experience. 

The game just brims with what I will call ""thoughtfullness"". The dev clearly put a lot of thought into the control scheme and it works very well. It's practical, useful and doesn't break the immersion. 

The environments are fantastic. When you're experiencing it in a VR environment it isn't cartoon-y. It's just what your environment looks like and  your brain gets on with the adventuring. 

Combat is a lot of fun if a tad simple. I think the key is to remember to make your own fun. Sweep the sword or hammer reasonably instead of wiggling it around like a wii controller and it's a much more satisfying experience. 

I've read many places that it's like a cross between D&D and Zelda. This is pretty accurate. More importantly, it's a metric tonne of fun!

I'm very excited to see what comes in the next chapter!"
24751783,"I had a blast playing the game! The melee combat was excellent and the skeletons great to fight, even the mining was surprsingly fun. The controls and movement for the room scale were great and I never got even a hint of sickness. 

The only negatives were the lack of a real story line and the the length of gameplay, but those were easily overlooked for how fun the game itself was.

I really hope the developer either puts out a few more chapters, or a similiar game in the future."
24751686,"Most fun game I've played on VR, reminded me of the Medevil games back on PS1 bit short but other than that a ton of fun!!"
24746640,"This game is incredible. Not one for writing reviews but felt compelled to thank you for such an amazing game and I really want to encourage this kind of development, truly an amazing game and VR experience. Keep up the good work :)"
24741803,"Certainly rough around the edges but also a enjoyable little adventure in a colorful world. There's not much that can compete with it right now so if you're up for playing this kind of game, I recommend it."
24737374,An amazing VR experience with really fun combat that makes it feel like you are actually wielding a sword. Great fun.

24735354,"By far my favorite game yet. It is insanely fun and immersive. The graphics are perfect for the kind of world you are in. Exploration, fights, treasure, it has it all. Yeah, there's only two chapters, but they are a fantastic two chapters. Highly recommended, as I am sure there is plenty more to come."
24733137,"This is one of the best HTC Vive games out there, even in its current state.  I would absolutely love to see more chapters and some kind of free-play arena mode with increasing challenges.  With more content, this could easily grow into essential, must have fantasy VR game of the year."
24732464,"AVOID. MINIMAL CONTENT AND PROJECT PROBABLY DEAD.
There's only about 60 minutes of gameplay and the devs have been promising ""moar levels soon!!!"" since it first came out, Its now 4 years later and all they've ever released is a few small tweaks and bug fixes to the original."
24728956, Teleport+controllers+roomscale=no motion sickness. Thank you for One of the best Vive game!
24727615,"I am really conflicted with this game.  I don't want to recommend or not recommend but am forced to pick one so, I have chosen recommentd.

I love playing Vanishing Realms but unfortunately I have two major problems with it. First, there is no way to save a game in progress so your progress is lost if you have to leave the game. Second, it crashes too much leaving me to start all over at a old save point. I notice the game has not been updated in over three months so I wonder if the bugs causing the crashes will be fixed.

My advice is to hold off buying until the next update in order to see if the issues have been fixed."
24713285,"Vanishing Realms is a fun exploration/fantasy combat game. Played on HTC Vive-


This game was the first game I bought for the vive, and still it remains one of the best ! I had great fun exploring every nook and cranny for all the hidden collectables. The combat, while sometimes mind-numbingly easy, really shows off how the vive is finally the answer to melee combat games. I had so much fun parrying (real men don't use shields) and dodging my way through the 3 or so hours of gameplay. It's very short, but even that is a lot more content than most other VR games available as of now.

All in all, a fun rpg style adventure, that shows off the capabilities of the vive in a variety of fun, and interesting ways."
24699152,"I like this game and it's made it to my favorites. It's nice and immersive, the graphics are very good, the combat is ok, but I keep going back to it when I want to escape reality for a few hours"
24697447,"It was okay fun..
I have completet the game in under 2 hours. And i took my time looking around.
Its simply to short..!! so if you are looking for a VR game to put a lot of hours in to. look somewhere els!.
At least untill this game gets more content.

Good:
Fun while it lastet.
It has a lot of potential.!!

Bad:
To short.!!
I was missing a scroll narrator. Yes i can read!. But it could be cool, with a dark voice, reading the scrolls.
The mobs are just standig there!."
24689222,Fantastic game I must say. Very immersive above all. Only thing I have to say is the relative shortness of the game (less than 3 hours) even with exploring. Can't wait to see if there are new chapters coming
24682074,"Absolutely worth it, even considering it's still early in development.  Moving through a fantasy adventure setting, sword fighting and exploring, it's absolutely worth the cost.  One of the most fun experiences I've had so far with the Vive!"
24678711,"amazing!! if this is the first of what's to come in RPGVR then i can't wait for more.  When i had to crouch behind a rock to protect myself from arrows, I thought this is how it should be."
24677402,This game ? A must have ! That's all i'm gonna say :)
24674146,"Highly recommend it.  Totally immerses you.  If I didn't get stuck last night, I would have been playing this straight through the night. Love dungeon crawls!

Pros:

1.  Beautiful graphics and sound. I have the Vive, and run the sound through my surround system. Very immersive.

2. Get exercise and be immersed in another world? Win win! This is way beyond the Nintendo Wii. 

2. I like that it recenters you in the room if you get close to your boundaries.

Cons: 

1.  It is annoying as you sometimes teleport and have to turn all the way around to do something. Walking around with a mouse and keyboard would be great! Or a way to turn your body without having to physically do it (a button on the controller?) When my head is tethered to cables, I don't really want to be turning around a lot. 

2. You do need a good size room, standing or seating will not work. Playing this seated would be fun. 

3. Missions, quests, NPCs missing
"
24671201,"By far the best VR game I've played on the ViVe, would love to have more content and ""episode 2"" but that seems to be in the works if the menu is to be believed. I would still recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and exciting VR experience"
24663668,"Between this and Pool Nation VR, the games for the vive are only gonna be better. Really hope more games are made for the vive as good as Vanishing Realms"
24657313,"What's here is good enough. Sometimes great! Great during chapter one, a really fun and interesting way to use the controllers; holding a shield in one hand and a sword/hammer in the other and fighting skeletons is great, mining feels great, inventory system is sweet and looting is aswell.

The game looks and sounds very good. The graphics aren't ""good"" but the artstyle is!  Most of the environments in chapter one are really cool, like being in a cartoonish dungeon in an Elder Scrolls-game.

My biggest gripe with this game is the thing called ""chapter two"", which is basically just a horde mode. This would be a very nice thing to have as an unlock (maybe? or just an option in the main menu) where you can head in and just do some fighting or to train, but not when it's called a chapter, like a big important part of the games story. Here's hoping it's just an early access place holder!

If you're on the fence: hold off for now and follow the games development, and when/if it's fully released (no update for like three months as of this writing) make a decision then. Or buy it if it's 50% off and and know what you're getting into."
24656565,"While starting out a bit slow (understandably so you can get used to the controls), this game soon has you swinging a sword, blocking blows and arrows with your shield, ducking behind cover before popping out to fire arrows, and in general moving around a lot in the 2m x 2m play area the game needs. 

I found I was able to pass the main first level in about 1.25 hours, and those 1.25 hours were highly enjoyable. I actually did not notice dropping into a combat stance, shield in front, sword at the ready, until I lunged and accidentally hit the chaperone bounds and the game auto-paused asking me to kindly recenter myself in the play area (with a nice big green circle with about 75 arrows pointing to it going ""stand here, dumbass"" :P ). Also, ducking behind boulders, knocking and drawing an arrow, then popping up and firing at those goddamned annoying arrow skeletons....

If you played things like D&D as a kid, or enjoyed games like Shadows of Mordor, Dragon Age, etc, where you did the sword n board n sorcery style of gameplay, this game is WELL worth the asking price. 

The second level, as noted, is more of a padding to the game, just to test you against multiple enemies and see how you do.... but it's still a great game and a lot of fun.

I think Indimo Labs, if they keep this up, may have the first ""Killer App RPG Dungeon Crawler"" with Vanishing Realms, and I highly recommend it :)"
24656160,As someone who loves RPG's this is all my dreams come true! It's as close to LARPing in my living room as it can get at this time. ^^
24650929,"Just finished Vanishing Realms™, have to say it is worth every penny, now already and .. still more to come. It has been said by others already, the first level is great, the second is not so good and does not really fit into a RPG style game. Looks/feels like it is made just to have some extra content ...
Nevertheless as said a great game, a must buy, lookign forward for new content."
24644976,"It's short at under 2 hours, but still one of the best experiences I've had exploring an environment in VR.  Lots of weapon variety, and combat is fun (if a little on the easy side).  Very much looking forward to additional chapters."
24642874,"It's an Amazing RPG experience until you realize the game's combat and mechanics is very shallow. Nevertheless the combat is still fun and since it's the first real RPG game I've play in VR (I dont consider Crystal rift a real VR Game since it is fucking stupid and just nausea inducing), I think I'll give this game a pass. Superb graphics but storytelling is not really there. The text prompts is mostly for the mini-puzzles that you need to do.

Good thing is the game isn't finished ""yet"" and there are more chapters to it free of charge (compared to the overpriced ""The Gallery"" 39 cad/episode which is fucking episodic)."
24637181,"Highly reccomend. Other than an issue I have with being able to pick things up on the very bottom of the floor, If you have a Vive you need this game. The sounds are perfect and other than the random hiccup, the tracking is spot on. Can't wait to see what comes in the future."
24636274,这才是VR正确方式
24628559,"I've seen Vanishing Realms called ""Zelda-esque"" and that's probably a good enough description. It's a fun little fantasy hack and slash with basic sword and board, bow, and fireball wand combat against cartoonish skeletons. This is yet another Vive game that will cause damage to your walls for those of us with minimal play spaces  :-) It's fun, engaging, and short. Too short, but honestly I think it's fun enough that it'll be worth another playthrough before too long. This is supposed to be the first chapter in a series, and I hope we get to see the rest. I hope they're a bit cheaper too, or longer. But us early adopters know that we've got to shell out some cash if we want anything decent, right?"
24622822,"This is the first room-scale game that I have played on Vive, mostly due to the fact that I have only just managed to clear a space large enough to play room-scale games.

This is an early access title, but other than the fact that it is rather short I can't see anything that needs more doing to it.  I had one crash throughout the entire game, which is better than for a lot of finished games.  

I thought that the point and click movement system would bug me but it didn't and lends itself to the game very well.  The combat felt polished and was enjoyable.  It feels a bit weird to have a huge sword that doesn't weigh anything but you quickly forget thtat once you are hacking, slashing, and parrying with the monsters in the world.  

The monsters are a bit limited, there are only six or seven of them but it really doesn't matter.  The sword and shield fighting is fun and well realised and the bow and arrow action is excellent.  My only problem was not being able to hit a skeleton thing on top of a pedestal because, as it turns out, the light shade was in the way, but that's just a VR thing.  

The only crash I had was that I suddenly dropped through the floor and couldn't find any way back.  It happened once and that was it.  Everything else was completely solid.  

The game is a little more cartoonish than the advertising graphic might indicate but, again, that didn't really detract from it.  

I am really, really hoping that the reason this is early access is so that further chapters can be added to it.

Pros:
- Very immersive
- Fun sword play where you have to wait for your opponent's vulnerable areas to be exposed and aim for them before you can do damage.  
- Brilliant bow and arrow action - you have to hold the bow in one hand and draw it with the other.  The arrows fly in an arc requiring you to take that into account for long shots.
- Very smooth gameplay
- Very few bugs or glitches
- Intuitive movement system
- Very polished product - I didn't even spot any typos in the scrolls

Cons
- A bit on the short side - what you see as my play time above is how long it took me to finish it but it was an enjoyable 2.9 hours.
- Quickly switching between weapons is a bit fiddly ... actually, I'm not even sure if this is a con as it adds to the realism a bit.

I would definitely recommend this game.  It is fun, cheap, and looks very professional.  Here's hoping for more."
24622419,"The first game I played on my HTC Vive. It is a first fun step into VR, but by no means a good game. It has cute but poor graphics, terrible animation and the fighting mechanics did not at all take advantage of the advanced 3D tracked controllers. When sword figthing you just wave the sword aroung like a maniac inside the enemy until the game engine decides it is considered a hit. Blocking is pretty much the same. Of course it would be challenging to build a full physics based combat engine, especially as you get no force feedback, but they did not try at all. I think most people who rated this game positively did it because the hardware is awesome and it is one of the first games of its kind, but the game uses like 3% of the potential. It looks more like an aging mobile game than a game that should define the future of VR gaming.  Sadly, it is still one of the better VR games out there, and if you want an RPG experience, you are pretty much stuck with this one at the moment. Still waiting for a real VR game..."
24620821,"By far the best RPG & dungeon crawler for VR.  Playing ordinary RPG game after trying Vanishing Realms is actually a real anticlimax.  Noting else compares to the experience of actually walking around within the dungeon, unraveling its mysteries and meeting life-sized adversaries face to face. I would get VR for this game alone!"
24619838,"One of the beste VR games so far, if you enjoy fantasy rpgs you need to try it."
24618156,"Very cool game, combat is a lot of fun. Not a long game, but it looks like more content is coming."
24617568,This was a blast to play through. The game isnt very long but whats there is very satisfying to play. Weilding a sword and sheild and having to swing at and block opponents is satisfying and empowering.
24614431,"Das Spiel ist der Hammer!
Sehr gelungen.
Als ich das erste Mal in die Spielwelt eingetaucht bin war ich schon vom Startbereich / Turorial recht beeindruckt.
Dann teleportiert man eigentlich erst in die richtige Spielwelt (ein Raum einer alten Ruine) und ich war absolut überwältigt.

Die Grafik passt sehr gut zum Spiel und das Erlebnis ist extrem immersiv.
Ich möchte Rollenspiele NIE WIEDER anders spielen! :)"
24613307,"First chapter = God
Second chapter = meh
third chapter = Will it come?"
24608369,游戏非常棒，满满的RPG元素，武器种类也非常多，怪物AI也可以。值得一玩
24601659,i had a blast whit this game. just got through chapter 1. best VR RPG for now
24598158,"Rock paper shotgun pretty much nails it, this is great. Don't miss it if you have VR"
24596519,非常棒的体验，强烈推荐
24588863,"This 100% needs to be in everyones library if you have VR.  This game is what VR was made for.  I got lost in the world and light story.  While not a AAA title it is the most fun I have had in my Vive.  It is the only time I got so into a game that I forgot about my boundries and hit something in the real world.  No damage though.  This game needs to be supported and needs to grow.  That would be my only complaint is that it is short, BUT, I would buy this game.  No questions asked.  Great fun, mechanics, skills, weapons, enemies, etc.  BUY THIS GAME!!!"
24586027,Fun while it lasts but is waaaaaaaaaaaaay 2 short. Also why is it an RPG???
24582359,"The room-scale combat mechanics (regardless of weapon: bow, shield, sword, wand...) is immersive and fun.  I even enjoyed the gold mining.  The visuals (weapons, surroundings, monsters etc.) are cool and I already look forward to headsets with higher resolution.   

All in all, this is my favorite game."
24565301,"I want more content!!! Great game, great controls, very imersive.  More content!!"
24549524,"Vanishing Realms is what a VR RPG should be.

Pros:
The visuals are crisp and reminiscent of the PS1 classic MediEvil. 
The controls are pretty much flawless with teleport-style click to move combined with room size free movement. 
Combat is as realistic as can be expected for this type of VR game. 

Cons:
The game is currently pretty short.
After how amazing the first chapter’s free-roaming adventure is, the second chapter (which consists of several timed combat trials) is a huge letdown. 

Overall, I would recommend the game, but I hope it receives some more attention from the developers soon and that the second chapter becomes a side quest-type addition rather than a part of the main story. 
"
24537702,I cleared half my room of furniture to play this. Dont regret it.
24537683,"Sympathique mais vraiment trop court. On découvre à peine le concept que déjà le boss final est là.
Beaucoup d'aspects ne sont qu'à peine abordés, et les combats sont impressionnants la première fois, et vraiment barbants par la suite. Du moment que l'on obtient l'arc, il suffit de se trouver une planque et on peut battre n'importe quel ennemi à l'usure.

On sent bien  que l'on est aux tout débuts de la réalité virtuelle pour le consommateur, et que les studios se précipitent pour sortir des jeux peu aboutis.

Je ne recommande pas."
24525635,"One of my favorite VR titles and what Im hoping to see more of in the future for use with my HTC VIVE.   The game isnt that complicated but the graphics are really fun(compared to other VR titles) and the combat is very well done.   If you own a VR headset then you really have to have this game in your library.  Its one of the better done VR games and hopefully, more and more will be added to it as time goes by(because its also early access)."
24525481,"This is the standard that VR needs to use.  Vanishing Realms is an incredibly immersive game with fun mechanics.  The simple act of picking up coins or placing items in my belt is fun.  Combat is fun and feels tense and real, if they can add a PvP option it would be even better.

"
24521579,"It's one of the longest VR game I've experienced so far. The gameplay is well done and engaging which is not an easy feat to accomplish!

Pros: 
- combat and weapons
- environment and treasure is well integrated for a VR game
- timeless graphics
Subjective Pro: Neither my friends nor I myself experienced motion sickness!

Cons:
- It's more like a tutorial and that explains combat, the environment and how the game mechanics work.
- My VR space is 2,5x2 meter and I had more than once the flashy warning that I am getting out of bounds. This is not really a con but it annoyed me that it interupted the combat very often.

I highly recommend this game and hope the next chapter will be even better than this one!"
24514257,"Way short, but well worth it! Shows the great promise of VR in the Zelda-esque RPG experience."
24513466,"If you're a fan of combat RPGs then you will love Forgotten Realms. You literally are INSIDE the game! It's a whole new perspective on playing a Hack N Slash rpg. The combat is intuitive and straight forward. You can dual wield shortswords or go with a sword and shield combo or become a ranger or become a mage with a stave. People are commenting the game is short., I wouldn't know because I'm still working my way through the two episodes that come with the game. But so far I am thoroughly enjoying myself. This game is more than worth the money IMO. It's polished, amazing and beyond immersive. 
"
24501171,"实在是太好玩了,我从来没玩过这么好玩的游戏.剑盾的打击感,场景的空间感,身临其境的音效.还有丰富的剧情和玩法,实在是VR游戏里的典范,比那些几分钟玩完的demo强太多培了"
24497616,"Super RPG, immersion excellente et prise en main sans difficulté.
seul problème : durée de vie courte.
3h pour finir le jeu."
24487921,"If you have a Vive, this is without a doubt a must have product. 

The teleportation system just feels right, and the interaction with items in the world and weapons is absolutely superb. One thing I would say is for the dev to look at how the Nvidia Funhouse does bow and arrow interaction, because thats the only area I feel could use a little tweaking. 

I'm a big lad. 6'3"".. Yet I found myself being stared down by 7-8 foot monsters, and having to block / dodge / duck and weave their attacks. When you hold a sword and shield, everything just feels natural, and you instantly forget you are in a closed off room with a couple of plastic controllers in hand looking like a massive twat. 

I'll be playing every update with relish, even though I've already had enough fun for the purchase price!

"
24486471,Showcase VR technology.  Still short but I'm happy to be an early adopter.  They have already released several updates since I download and believe they will continue to do so.
24483860,"I""m not one to post reviews on games and the like, but had to make an exception for Vanishing Realms. The creators are really on to something here. Prior to Vanishing, most of the VR games I've experienced liked story or depth. VR reminds of a mashup of Prince or Persia meets Zeld in a room scale. New to Vive, really loving this game...so far."
24477792,By far my favorite room scale experience. This game has me craving so much more. The inventory sytem works great and fighting is intuitive and easy but is enough of a challenge to be engagin.
24470830,"If you've ever wanted to wander into the mist, far, far away from humanity, and end up in a world of red-eyed orcs and mysterious castles, this is your game.  The game gently leads you through a castle filled with hidden keys you need to find, potions you need to acquire, weapons you have to earn, gold you need to collect, halls of swinging blades you have to dodge, traps you need to spring, orcs you have to battle, and dwarven gems you need to mine. It is a VR tribute to Tolkien, World of Warcraft, D&D and all that geeks hold holy.

 It is tough to believe one person developed this game.  It is a work of love and art, humor and logic.  It has less resolution and polish than we will see someday in VR.  But it is utterly charming, ninety-five percent bug free and much more well thought out than many current titles.   You can dodge enemy arrows as well as shoot your own.  Your sword has to hit the enemy in a weak point before he takes damage.  Mana potions are spaced throughout the scenarios such that you can get the number you need to survive and eventually win.  Almost everything works the way it is supposed to.  This is what makes a world believable:  a set of consistent rules.  And I believed I was in that world right through to the very end."
24450577,"I've tried many titles available for VR (which is not a whole lot..) - this is by far the best one i have played.  it's a combination riddle game and simple action game. the action is really fun - wands, bows, swordplay, riddles are interesting. and who thought picking up floating coins would be so much fun!
very warmly recommended. the only VR game i played for hours straight. fun to play and fun to watch"
24450163,You will not regret this purchase; the most fun you'll have in VR.
24449876,"I can't realistically not recommend this game. If you like what you see on the store page, then you'll like what you play in game. 

A few picky little ways to improve this game would be to have the melee skeleys attack a liiiiiiiittle faster. Admittedly, I two'd in my pants a lil bit at the first skeleton, but when I had the time to actually go drop a two in the bathroom before getting slashed, the intimidation wore off. 
Also, here's some even stingier pickiness - it would be awesome for the weapons that you hold to interact with all the environment and not just phase through it. Having my weapons simply go through walls and the likes makes the game feel less realistic than it could be. A fantastic example of what prime enviornment X held item physics should look like in this game could be seen in Modbox. 

This game definitely is a step in the right direction. There aren't any other Vive games out there that feel like they will become a classic quite as much as this one does.  Buy it, and leave your feedback so that the dev gets a better idea of where to direct this game."
24432214,"El mejor juego para HTC VIVE, asi de simple, dudaba en si comprarmelo.... hazlo, no te vas a arrepentir."
24419791,"I've been trying a bunch of VR games and this is one of the best so far.

Great sense of immersion in a fantasy dungeon-crawler world. The skeletons are actually pretty intimidating when you have to get up close and fight them.

I've completed the first dungeon and am looking forward to the second."
24418611,"This game is one of those experiences that really show off how amazing VR can be when done right.  I felt transported from the moment I booted up the game, and had a blast exploring the world created for me. I have the minimum play area and it hindered my experience some simpy because I couldn't walk around enough to explore, thus resorting to the teleport feature. 

Once I move the Vive to a bigger play area though, I'll be diving right back in to start it all over. I only finished the first chapter so far and it was a blast."
24418233,I really liked the game. Great immersion. No complaints from me. Looking forward to the next chapter. Keep up the fantastic work!!!
24416490,"Riddles, Hidden Treasures, Fighting off skeletons. 

Loved every minute of this game, took some time getting used to the ""invenotry"" but this is with all new VR experinces. I can't wait for more!"
24411046,"蠻不錯的遊戲有劍有弓有盾
"
24408504,The most fun I have had with my Vive so far. A must have game.
24399836,"Fun, simple adventure game that's currently too short for the cost (still recommended since that will likely change as it moves out of early access). There's basically no story, the ""second level"" is really just a timed series of battles, the riddles aren't really riddles, the graphics are cartoony, the inventory system is OK if confusing due to objects being on top of each other and only seeing the top one, but none of that matters. It's still fun, still looks good and runs well...it's just early still, and already one of the better experiences."
24395407,This is by far my favorite VR game on the Vive.  It is simply fantastic.  I also really enjoy the movement controls.  They kept them really simple and it works well.  Can't wait for more!
24395079,Great experience on the vive. The melee felt especially connected and fun. I battled 3 skeletons at the same time and won. I felt like Achilles. I also tried to set my wife on fire with my staff when she was trying to get my attention so there is definitely a danger there... Its quite immersive... (Note: I do not condone the setting on fire of loved ones even while under the influence of VR)
24390731,Best VR RPG so far !
24383867,"A solid RPG on its own, but with the vive it makes it quite the experince. Brings immerision to a whole new level.

Considering how little is avaible for the vive right now, I would consider this a must own."
24381119,"Genial! Wer Spiele wie ""Zelda"" mag wird Vanishing Realms lieben! Das Gefühl wirklich ein Schwert gegen Gegner zu führen oder mit dem Bogen zu zielen und schießen, super! Wenn dann noch etwas Story dazu kommt und die Gegner etwas anspruchsvoller werden..."
24380669,Very cool combat system and pretty immersive experience.  Lots to be learned here for other VR developers.   The floating UI is a bit clunky and bugs out a bit which is the only real immersion breaker.  Shield blocking feels great.
24380361,This game just flat rocked. It has a bit of everything and is a great intro to VR dungeon crawling. I have never bothered to write a review before but this game is worth the money and is a ton of fun.
24376534,"this is the best game i played so far in my htc vive coz you feel like your inside the dungeon and the battle part with skeleton warriors ar so cool..12/10 rating for me

24375559,"Sooooo Good. The game is not supper long (to be expected for an early relase), but it is amazig to play. Just walking and looking around in are quite satisfying and the battles are fun. I thought it was well worth the money and a great first game for my Vive. Also excited to know it is not done because that means there is more to come."
24369974,"Vanishing Realms ist für einen kleinen Titel gut gemacht, besonderes Lob verdient das Inventar. Auch wenn ich mir wüschen würde, das die Lebenspunktanzeige präsenter sichtbar wäre. so ist das Inventar extrem übersichtlich und Intuitiv. Jeder Gegenstand ist in zwei Taschen als dreidimensionales Item abgebildet und sollte man mehrer der gleichen Sorte besitzen, bekommt der umgebene Ring des Gegenstands einfach eine kleine Kugel. Waffen, Schilde. Bögen und Stäbe haben ihren eigenen Invetarplatz. 

Beim Kampf sollte man sich die Zeit nehmen die Bewegungen des Gegners zu berücksichtigen und nicht in ein ""wildes Gefuchtel"" verfallen. Trifft der Gegner das Schild des alten Egos, prallt die Waffe ab und man bekommt die offene Flanke als  Möglichkeit zur Reposte geboten. Leider funktioniert das Abprallen beim Überkopfschlag des Gegners nicht und die Waffe geht glatt durch Schuld und Körper durch, auch wenn dies nicht als Treffer gezählt wird. Läßt man sich wie beschrieben darauf ein, wird man aber mit einem Kampf belohnt, der mit der gegebenen Technik sich nicht echter anfühlen könnte. 

Schade finde ich, das Bäume nicht als Deckung nutzbar sind, Pfeile gingen bei mir regelmäßig durch die Bäume durch, bei Steinpfeilern klappte dies aber anstandlos. Es macht wirklich Spass sich hinter einem Pfeiler zu verstecken und zum schießen der Pfeile mal kurz um die Ecke zu linsen. 

Der Preis ist wie bei den meisten VR Produkten hier recht hoch. Es scheint im Bereich VR gerade eine Art Goldgräberstimmung zu herschen. Aber auf der anderen Seite ist der Preis bezogen auf die Arbeitsleistung die hier sicher drin steckt und der geringen Zahl von verkauften Einheiten im Bereich von VR wohl durchaus angemessen. 

Ich freue mich auf einen 2ten Teil, eine klare Kaufempfehlung!"
24366443,"Vanishing Realms is pretty cool. I'm only about an hour into it, but ducking around corners and immersing yourself in the surroundings, and to the story (as long as you do so with and ample immagination to fill in more role playing for yourself, D&D style), make for a really fun experience. I got a blade, and it made me long for a great VR Sword and board experience. I wish Enderal supported Vive."
24359529,"There is a reason why this game is so highly rated - it is one of the most polished and fun games available for the HTC Vive. Many people have compared it to being in a Zelda game and I couldn't agree more. I would even say it even has a taste of Shadowgate in its mixture...

The artistic direction is wonderful, the controls are superb, and it runs flawlessly on my machine (i5/780 Ti).

The only gripe? Too short! When I was done I wanted... no... I NEEDED more. Keep up the fantastic work and please keep updating with new content/chapters!"
24357872,"This experience was just awesome. At first I was not really willing to pay for this game based on the preview video on steam. I was finding the graphics poor and the game play static. But this was before I actually tried the game!
Once you are inside you forget about the graphics and the game play actually works pretty well. You can wield 2 weapons, a shield and a sword or even a bow. And if you come low life, grab a potion on your wraist and drink it, while you try to dodge or shield yourself with your left hand! This was just cool.

As of now (16th of July 2016) the game is still in early access and has only 3 levels (castle, outdoor mountain and arid arena on an island) and the experience is quite short (around 2 hours), but this was one of the best experience I had so far with the HTC Vive.
And don't forget, early access backers will allow those kind of talented teams to produce more games, so do not hesitate and enter the Vanishing Realms!"
24351767,"This may just be the best game I have picked up for the Vive.  It runs really well on my rig (I have an older i5 and a 970) with no visual glitches or crashes so far.  On top of that, the gameplay is incredible. It is very immersive.  You feel like you've been dropped into a Zelda game. The combat is superb, I found myself fighting skeletons that are taller than me...Room Scale works great, in many of the battles I was dodging, ducking, parrying, etc!  Keep up the great work I would love to see more content and chapters added, and I haven't even finished the game yet!  Also the inventory system (utility belt) was a nice way to integrate a HUD, although it might help to have health and mana atop your field of view at least durin battle so you can see it without taking eyes off your enemy.
"
24351462,"Excellent jeu, celui que j'ai le plus apprécié depuis que je possède un VR. Coté aventure, celui-ci est de loin le meilleur."
24350668,Fun game very imersive like real life zelda
24345550,Great! Finished the first two chapters in about 2 hours. I'm excited to see where it goes from here.
24343824,Absolutly amazing! awesome !!!
24337848,玩VR如果不买这个游戏的话就真的没有体验VR了！
24335473,"Best VR game there is IMHO. The whole reason I wanted a Vive was for a really cool fantasy RPG. This was it. Very smooth, no lag or jitter on my min reqs system. Great gameplay with good mechanics. Finding items and collecting money - the fighting is smooth and interesting. It's less about flailing and more about timing and location.

Right now the game is a bit short. But no complaints here - This is my favorite game so far for the Vive and it just means I have more to look forward to in the future with its updates.

If you were on the fence about buying this game. Just do it. You will not regret it."
24332482,This game doesn't look like much but it is still the best game currently available for the Vive.
24330011,"Solid VR game. 

no single part of this game is amazing, But the some of its parts is a strong story driven game. The graphics arnt amazing but are crisp and portray the world well. The controls work well and take little time to get to grips with. Good audiowork and plenty to explore. 

Fighting skellys with a sword and shield is great fun."
24329093,"Vanishing Realms is without doubt my favorite HTC Vive game to date.  Its a classic single player aventure dungeon crawl - dark corridors, flaming torches, swords, skeletons - all there for your fantasy adventure enjoyment.  The puzzles are fun and the combat is even more immersive than I anticipated; I can still visualise ducking behind a boulder to shoot off arrows at the opposing skeleton warriors.  I have played both available Chapters 1 and 2, and while I slightly preferred the more dungeon quest style of Chapter 1, they have both left me wanting more."
24327845,"A bit pricey but all-in-all, I'd say it's worth it. The game isn't too long but also not super short. It's a great foothold on the future of RPGs (VR-style.) Be sure to have ample playing room otherwise it'll auto-pause a lot."
24325385,"Every RPG player's DREAM, this game is arguably the best on the VIVE, depending on what your tastes are of course.
The combat far surpasses anything else i've played, there's a whole bunch of weapons and upgrades to choose from too. Easily worth the 20 dollars."
24324888,"fantastic experience for all Vivers. If you like dungeon crawling, RPG'ing, swordplay, magic casting... stuff.... you'll love it."
24320695,"I've been pretty underwhelmed with the VR games I've played so far, mostly they've sturck me as gimmicky and rushed. I was beginning to regret buying the HMD.

But then I bought Vanishing Realms as a bit of a last ditch really and I'm very glad that I did. It's not a perfect game but it's a lot of fun and the most immersive game I've played so far.
It is clearly a game that has been concieved and built from the ground up for the VR medium and it tells against games that have last minute VR tacked on. 

Give it a go, it's worth it but have a towel nearby because it gets very sweaty very quickly, also be careful of your space - I nearly took out my monitor along with the skeleton who was about to stab me in the face."
24320105,This is Zelda in VR and it's unbelievably fantastic.  This is what you want from a adventure game.  Sooooooo Good.
24308746,Awesome.
24308180,"This game was fantastic.  Sometimes the skeletons backpedaling was a pain, and that could be improved.  I kept having to reposition with the teleporter while fighting.  That's kind of a pain and definitely needs work.  Otherwise, this game was absolutely incredible.  The ability to go sword and shield or use two weapon or use a bow was great.  I'd love to see a more complete merchant type experience, to sell old weapons, that sort of thing, but all in all, this game was top notch.  I felt like I was really creeping around exploring in a fantasy world.  I'd like a map system, but since it's VR it's not ""really"" necessary."
24303200,By far the best VR Game yet. Wish the story was a bit more interesting and the game was a bit longer at all.
24290461,"A very fun game; one of the best I've yet to play on the vive. 

If I had any complaints, it's simply that Im not a fan of the teleport mechanic. A walking option would make the game so much more immersive for myself. Otherwise, this game gets all the praise."
24289112,In my opinion this is one of the best if not the best experience on Vive. Fighting feels natural and fun. It takes good advantage of room scale movement and also has a teleport function. My only complaint is that it ended too soon. Can't wait for the next chapters.
24284845,"The most immersive VR experience so far.

Pros:
Great graphics (Cartoony but fun)
Great sound
Great movement
Fun intuitive Gameplay

Cons:
The autopause (Can be disabled)
Short early access experience

As of now this game is an amazing VR experience and i look forward to future updates. I would have gladly paid full retail for 15 or so levels. 

What i would like to see:
Crafting system (Pick up resources while mining since the mining is already in place)
PVP arena? Not sure how viable that would be
More levels
More of a back story

In its current state this is a very fun game and i hope the devs keep up the great work."
24277645,"It is very good but very short, need more chapters."
24268659,"Pretty fun game.  First chapter takes like 2 hours (exploration + combat play), second chapter takes like a half hour (pure arena combat).  The health/mana/gold meters are at an uncomfortable position though, forcing players to look directly down to be able to read the numbers clearly.  Overall great for what is currently released."
24262357,"Vive controller became sword
hit barrol
barrol broke
10/10 would hit barrol again.

Controller became bow
turned bow around and shot myself in the face
arrow sticking out of my face
10/10 would shoot my face again."
24258507,"While the textures aren't crazy high and some models are somewhat low poly it makes for bland video and screenshots. HOWEVER, once you are in the vive the world is absolutely amazing. This game is showing what the vive can be. When an enemy thrusts at you the sensation is so immersive.

An ABSOLUTE must have for Vive owners."
24257855,"The best game for VR hands down, enough said"
24257296,"UPDATE! 7/14/16    

You can definitely dual wield as well as holding a sword or other weapon in a defensive manner. Aka like a knife against your forearm blocking and stabbing with each hand... Unreal game. These devs need to keep content coming. Fan for life here. =) Take my monies.




Best Experience so far on Vive next to Out of Ammo.

Starts pretty slow intentionally so you get acclimated then throws the game at you faster as you get deeper. Idk what the short game reviewers are talking about I explore each area and find treasures hidden that is half the fun. There are diff weapons to use and the archer enemies are my favorite block arrows with your shield and also deflect them with a well timed sword swing. Combat is geared toward fencing and quick advance and withdrawal or block and timed thrusts. Can't say enough good things. I really hope the devs make more for this. I would love to see this become a 100+ hr game and I bet most people would agree as well. 

Summary  Give these guys your cash folks. These are the types of developers you want representing the initiation of VR. It is the direction we want try and you'll agree."
24248692,I hope they keep making more and more chapters. There are a working on chapter 3 and I can't wait.
24247441,"Level 1 was fun, timed trial crap on level 2 made me regret buying it. Won't be playing it again."
24245695,"The game is cool, great gameplay. 
But they should definitly add more things to do in it.
I finished it in 1hour and a half. This is definitly not worth his price
The story is so short and has 0 replayable value.
"
24245028,Games like Elite: Dangerous had nearly convinced me that my new HTC Vive was a useless gimmick. Then I tried Vanishing Realms and everything changed. The motion controls are amazing. The game is incredibly immersive. Hopefully this will set the template for future VR games.
24243641,Easily the best game on VR right now. Only downside is that in its current state it is a bit short. The dev is rolling it out in phases but I'd still recommend the game as it stands right now.
24243392,"This is the greatest VR game on steam ive played to date. It is a must have at whatever price they are asking. Although a complete playthrough doesnt take much time (couple hours if you explore everything), It really shows the full potential of the Vive."
24242424,"Haven't had this much fun on the computer since the original doom.  Between the chilling moments and learning what to do to defeat new enemies, you quickly forget the ""virtual"" part, it feels like it IS reality, and you have to explore and survive!  This is what I've always dreamed VR would be.  A must have for any Vive owner. Looking forward to more content, whether it's free episodes or more $, I'm in!

10/10 Would take another arrow to the forehead for chapter 3!"
24242170,"WOW!!!

This is another perfect VR game for the VIVE.  The controls work great as designed.  I'm in a D&D game I'm there and I'm using my body.  AWESOME!!

Just Awesome!"
24234905,"By the time I took off the HMD it was well past midnight. This is exactly what VR games are meant to be! Between the scavenging for gold to buy powerful wepons and items, bashing skeletons over the head with a sword, and exploring the beautiful world there is no dull moment. The developer clearly know how to build a VR experience, and avoided all the VR faux pas. It's the most comfortable and enjoyable VR experience I have had to date.

I eagerly await more episodes!"
24228105,"If this wasn't a VR game it would be very generic and boring, but VR makes it great. It's actually exciting to sneak around in dungeons, killing monsterns and picking up loot again."
24225458,Really shows the potential of RPGs in VR.
24220799,"Took me a while to make it past the first couple rooms, but as soon as I got my sword and sheld, the game got 10x more fun in a hurry."
24209515,"Excellent jeux. Très intuitif et beau, les contrôles sont simples et le gameplay bien réalisé. Rien de mieux pour découvrir la VR."
24202085,"THIS is where VR needs to go.  If you have a Vive, you NEED this title!  This is like the Legend of Zelda in VR, complete with puzzles, swordplay, items, and magic.  All I need is a creepy old man in a cave, and the experience would be complete!

Why are you still reading?!?  Buy it already!  

Pros:
- (mostly) interactive environment - get a torch near a candle, it lights!
- I opened a door by grabbing the key out of my bag, and just put it in the lock!  Ate an apple by bringing it up to my face!  Simple and immersive control.
- SWORDS!!  
- SHIELDS!!
- put those last two together and swashbuckle with some skeletons!!

Cons:
- Hit detection (I know - it's hard in VR)
- Movement only with teleport - eventually, we're going to have to get used to using the pads to move forward - motion sickness be damned!!  Dodging arrows feels like cheating when you can just teleport away, though...

Dev is doing a great job so far - keep up the good work!  

AAA studios - are you paying attention?  This is the first step toward my VR Skyrim!!!  While I'm ranting: Nintendo!  VR Zelda / Luigi's Mansion / Star Fox / Metroid / Mario Kart....JUST MAKE THEM ALL!!!!

Seriously - this is an inspiring use of the Vive's capabilities.  Keep up the great work."
24197659,I have to admit; I was extremely hesitant to buy this game. It kept seeing it pop up and finally bought it. I regret not buying it earlier. I’ve played over and hour so far and I love it. If you are in the market for a new game to play or are simply undecided JUST BUY IT. It’s a lot of fun and worth every penny.
24185419,"[h1]Vanishing Realms is a showpiece of things to come, and great things at that[/h1]

     Indimo Labs has crammed as much MMO / RPG elements into a small compelling package as they can. This feels more like a showpiece of what's possible, more than a full game, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

     While playing this I often ran into situations where I thought ""Wow, it would be cool if this was an MMO"". While mining I thought ""Wow, profession systems translate really well to VR"". While switching from the bow, to the sword and board, to dual wielding swords, to the magic system, I realized there's a very real possibility of a class system here. Each style of combat was fun enough on it's own and could be expanded upon.

     That brings me to my only negative about this game. There isn't enough of this game. GIVE ME MORE. I know the install base for VR isn't large enough yet to invest the resources that it would take to build up a large MMO universe, but Vanishing Realms gives you just a taste of what's possible and I'm hungry for more. It's only a matter of time and I look forward to the next chapters. That being said the game progresses very fast and I was able to complete it in under 2 hours. That 2 hours also contained me fumbling around with puzzles and looking in every corner, so I'm sure others could finish it much quicker."
24180999,"Salve a tutti, premetto che il gioco l'ho comprato perchè attirato dalla prospettiva di visitare un dungeon in prima persona tramite lo steam vr e sinceramente non mi aspettavo molto.
Ma per fortuna mi sono sbagliato, il gioco è fluido, disegnato benissimo e non stanca la vista (che per lo steam vr è tutto).
Combattere i nemici tirando di spada, magia e arco non ha prezzo.
Sinceramente lo consiglio.
Un video dimostrativo:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc-yPM8xw9o"
24173111,"Maybe it's kind-of short, but it doesn't matter.
I didn't like the trials, but the main game was fun."
24172226,"An awesome experience!  One of the very best I've found for the Vive so far.  The swordplay face-to-face with the enemies is very cool and intense, and even the simple act of slicing away at jars and crates for gold and gems is fun.

The sound is good.. creates a convincing atmosphere.

This is a well-polished game and one that every Vive owner who's an RPG fan should experience."
24168884,"This is a delightful game. It was the first time I stepped into VR and thought ""wow, this has some nice atmosphere to it"". Of course, I played the VR Tutorial which had some lovely open spaces, but the buildings in this were very satisfying. Wielding the swords, holding torches, and searching around for clues was very satisfying. The fact that I could parry blows was also very satisfying.

However, I would love some satisfying tactile feedback for all the weapons. (I don't want to say which, since it could be a spoiler.) 

The teleport movement was jarring, but it worked well in this environment. I used it to step out of the way of critters a lot more than I should have... (and it feels like cheating, but... hey, what do you do?) They're using teleport to keep you fromt getting disoriented, of course, but I'd love to have the option since warping around the map to discover clues made me feel like I was cheating. :)

I nice dungeon crawl. Not all that much replayability, but it's inexpensive and has quite a bit of content. Plus, it's a great introduction to the platform."
24168676,"30 years after my first fantasy game on Commodore  64, I fight for ""real"" ennemies that are ""in front"" of me. Thanks 	Indimo Labs, it's an amazing experience."
24167802,"Very simple RPG done right. You're not playing a character attacking stuff with a mousebutton or keyboard, you ARE the character and you wield your sword. YOU have to block incoming attacks or dodge incoming arrows.

This is a must buy for your Vive!"
24152329,"Очень хорошая игра, нравится участие в ней! Беда в том, что пока мало уровней, но нам она очень понравилась! Магия, Лук, Меч с щитом, всё очень здорово! Добавьте уровней)"
24150334,"Second favorite game so far on vive. Great feel to it. Won't go on about what it has to offer. But rather what would help it be great. Firstly, better riddles - heard the guy out of the hobbit is free. They are too simple and direct, more of a rhyme really. Puzzles, indie style. Combat is a bit easy for me. Block swipe up, block swipe up. There is no sword play which would throw this game light years ahead. There is another tech demo on here skull something, sorry can't remember. But that has a little sword play in it which is on the right track.
Anyway great work worth the money"
24146638,"C'est vraiment la meilleur experience VR à l'heure d'aujourd'hui ( et d'assez loin à mon goût). Ca me parait impensable d'avoir un HTC Vive sans ce jeu !

It is truly the best VR experience for now ( and far away). It is a must have if you got the HTC Vive."
24146124,RELEASE 2ND EPISODE IM ITCHING FOR MORE I HAVE AN ADDICTION PROBLEM GIVE ME MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE !!!!!!!!..................oh i give this gave 5 stars out of five a must buy.
24132313,"Short yes, but awesome."
24128133,必须入手的经典游戏，开始的时候控制页面没有做好，但是现在已经更新过了，能让新手玩家更方便的操作，而且有存档哦。
24121196,Good little RPG title combat is fun and well implimented this is very very short however and the end level feels like it was put there for lack of content
24107470,"Whew!!! 78 minutes?! That's how long my first session was? Wow I feel absolutely beat. This game really got me into a sweat. Was great fun though! It's your typical dungeon crawler ish game, but in VR. So your sword is an actual sword you hold and swing, your shield is an actual shield you hold to block attacks from your enemies, be it arrows, bombs, other swords, etc. And your enemies sometimes have shields too, so you can't just go swinging constantly, gotta time your strikes and aim to get past their shields. There's a bit of traditional style gameplay, things like finding keys and such, but it's of course all VR, so finding a key is literally finding a key, and using it is the same. Overall a pretty fun game and of course an awesome VR experience, really loved it. I'll most certainly give this one another play session.. later.. after I catch my breath.."
24102719,Very lovely experience that gives good indications where VR could be going. Rather short though.
24100417,Fun and deeply immersive. This will be my go-to demo for how amazing VR can be.
24095810,"So just got it to the VR world and this game has me very, excited to see what game developer a capable of in the future. The game itself is very fun and a great experince, considering this is an early access I really can not wait to see the fully developed game."
24092980,"If you have a Vive, you have to play this game. But don't let my hours on record fool you, I've only spent maybe 3 hours playing myself, but I've had about a dozen people play it on my Vive. It's everyone's favorite game so far. From my 12 year old daughter to my 40+ year old friends.

My only complaint is replayability. Once you beat chapter 2 you're done. You either start a new character or wait until chapter 3 comes out, which I hope is soon because I can't wait to play more.

Still well worth the money even if the dev never releases another drop of code.

Oh, and unlike some others have said, don't disable auto-pause. Unless you really like broken windows. Even with it I have marks on my Vive controllers from people slamming them into the closet doors."
24082811,"Since I was a child, this is the type of game I wanted when I thought about Virtual Reality. The actual execution is not the best it could be, but it's definitely time well spent."
24081391,"This is a fantastic game showcasing the immersive qualities of VR.  You get to explore dungeons and fight skeletons.  What more could you ask for.  Overall a fun, but short game.  Can't wait for a full game to be released.

The teleporting system works really well, but someone needs to figure out a better way to move around especially during fights."
24074045,FUCK THAT
24071103,"I loved Chapter I. Chapter II sort of seemed ill placed and put a damper on the rather think 'plot' the game has. It was ok. Overall its agood bit of fun and shows what is potentially possible in the RPG genre for VR. I enjoyed the melee combat the most, though the bow seems exploitable especially vs bosses. Worth trying out if it sunder $15. $20 seems steep for what it is."
24070009,"This game is really what VR should be.  Really great game, very immersive.  Hopefully the difficulty will increase some soon."
24069609,"This game gives me hope for the future of VR.  Having a sense of presense in a world that exists virtually is an incredible feeling to have!  This games give you the feeling of being alive in its world.  Fair warning, the game mechanics are quite simple, as most VR games currently, however the game play in VR is some of the best I have ever encountered.  Sword fights feel natural, shooting a bow feels great, and casting magic leaves you feeling powerful!  

One thing I would like to see implemented in all VR games is the ability to switch between teleporting and walking with the touchpad.  Currently, the right touchpad teleports you around.  Supposedly this is to prevent people from becoming disoriented, however I would like to test it for myself,  It would be nice to use the right touchpad similarly to the way the steam controller touchpad works.  

I hgihly recommend this game to anyone who has a Vive.  You will not regret the time spent in this game.  I can't wait to finish the 2 chapters and see what the future holds for this game and VR."
24068387,This game was truly amazing and I can tell ALOT of hard work went into this and it was definently worth it all! 10/10 rating for me cant wait for the next quest!
24055675,"Even for Early Access this is an amazing showcase of what is possible with VR! I was blown away by the level of immersion I felt while in this game.

You can fight melee, ranged or even cast spells. Explore the area, search for clues, find keys and treasure and fight monsters.

Even though the game is quite short, it is worth every penny (15$ during summer sale). This game is what gets me excited for the future of VR."
24052803,The sword fighting is very broken. I have no idea how to block or hit an enemy precisely. It's literally hit or miss.
24044140,"I very much enjoyed this title, it was something that I kept seeing time after time that this was a must buy for the Vive and I must agree. The experience is something entirely different from a normal RPG. I have not had time to play it all the way through, but for the first hour or so that I played, I was having a blast. I look forward to completing it later when I have time and will try and update my review then."
24043650,Best Vive game to date. Crazy short but it is basically zelda in VR. Craving for more content !

24040557,Ich finds echt hammer
24039212,"This game gets so much right. Every action you can do feels very natural to the point where you can intuit how to solve situations without the game's obvious hints. The story is whatever but as a proof of concept for fantasy fighting/exploration in VR, this is a shining example."
24034537,"any zelda originalies here? well, BY THIS AND BE ZELDA. great game, i highly recommend! decent play time of roughly 12 hours as well!"
24011133,"This game is exactly what VR is all about. Hacking and slashing, collecting loot, a lengthy adventure, bows, swords, magic, I simply can't get enough of it! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for more than just a tech demo!"
24004950,"Great game, no motion sickness at all, world looks amazing, gives you the creeps, overall great game.. buy it, trust me."
24001961,"Raiting it positive, it has a good foundation.  Really you should buy this if you want to support VR,  and this type of game.  It's fun but short,  its missing some polish but it is early access.  Combat is fair to good, is it worth $20,  yea if you spent 800 or so on the vive, and 2k on a computer, $20 for this game is a good long term investment in the VR gaming market.  Right now a lot of people are looking at it and what is selling, you see all this free and shareware stuff while developers are learning what people like and what is practical in VR.   This is amoung them buy it,  stop reading buy it enjoy the hour or so of content 2 hours if you really scout for all the hidden goodies...

One note, the Dragon wand, meh really that would have been awesome if it shot lighting bolts that cracked like lighting does when it hits your home or the one next to you....then bwhahahaha..oh sorry got carried away."

23999944,"Super cool and immersive, when the skeleton comes out of the floor it makes you jump.  Fighting is intense and active.  This is the future of gaming."
23992145,"Fantastic game. Thoroughly enjoyed the play through. The monsters and combat are so polished it's phenomenal, definitely makes you feel like a badass every time you strike one down. Not to mention the archery and defensive tactics gives this game an entirely separate mechanic to most other VR games out there. Highly recommend."
23986602,"Best RPG game I have EVER PLAYED. VR makes this type of game REAL. This game made me FEEL emotions, fear, excitement, trepidation, pride. When you see several monsters and you feel like it really is your a$$ on the line it makes the game much better than playing one of these on a normal screen.

I have played most of the games offered for the VIVE. A lot of them are at best mini games and I feel should not be charged for. This game on the other hand was worth every single penny! I highly recommed this game.

My only question is what are you waiting for? Get this game and start playing!"
23975369,"This was one of the most amazing VR experiences I've had so far.  It's fun, challenging in parts, and really creates a great RPG spirit.  I think this game will pave the way for amazing VR RPGs to come.  My only complaint is that it's too short.  Just when I was really getting into it, I got to the end.  I want another chapter!"
23974964,"This is what VR is all about, excellent graphics, adventure, strategy, fighting all rolled into one. Great RPG, very interested and will keep you going for a long time. The fights are very realistic also. This is a great game, even if I'm only on level 3!! Good job!! highly recommend even if you're not into RPG."
23971071,"This VR Game is what I want RPG games to use for reference. This is a amazing title and far worth the play. I felt part of the game. 

The game could use more levels, etc, but for being one of the first RPG games for VR, it exceeded my expectations. 9/10"
23969183,"Awesomely fun game... cant wait for more.... =)
"
23964291,Super immersive. Recommend.
23946195,"I've always loved dungeon crawler games.   Its hard to explain the feeling... when you are literally crawling through a dungeon (at least in Virtual Reality).   I've never had so much fun looting!  More loot!  MOAR!!

Combat was surprisingly satisfying as well.  Exploration was great.  

10/10. Can't wait for the next installation/episode/whatever."
23941512,"This game is so good it's worth writing a review over.  In all the ways it could disappoint, it doesn't.  So far, so awesome."
23939496,"This is still the best experience I've had in VR.  Very, VERY much looking forward to the next chapter"
23937928,"Great game. Puzzles not to hard. Looks great. Little bit of kinda glitching at the start levels, but seemed to work after that. Well Worth it. Great with the Vive.
"
23933050,"A Must buy for the vive, would have liked some graphics settings (allow supersampling)"
23931283,"Despite this being in Early Access, the developer has done a great job and it provides one of the better VR experiences currently on the market. I have not finished the entire game, but I have enjoyed almost every minute of it. The world is quite large and there is plenty to do. I wish it were a bit more exploratory, and less on RAILS.

The graphics are a bit low poly, but that is made up for with a well conceptualized and executed style. My biggest gripe about the look and feel of the game is the inventory system and player stats. The live at the player waistline and can be hard to make out at the periphery of the Vive's screen when you have to look down. Other ties, they are blocking your view if you need to interact with something at your feet.

I have encounter some bugs that have caused crashes, and in one situation, I got into a part of the environment, that I was not able to teleport out of.

Combat comes in two flavors, melee and projectile. Melee suffers a bit from the fact that VR can't provide physical resistance. Projectile, shooting arrows and using magic wands is the really fun stuff. Dodging behind rocks and other obstacles to avoid being hit yourself can get your heart rate going and really brings you into the world.

If I were to compare it to any other VR experience I have had, the closest thing would be The Gallery, which is significantly better in the graphics and story department, but it is more puzzle oriented, with Vanishing Realms more fun.

I highly recommend this game and really hope the developer continues to expand upon it."
23930915,"Nett gemachte Welt, spannende Kämpfe pe Schwert, Schild und Bogen. Unnütz aufgezwungenes Magie-System und man hat sich nach knapp einer Stunde leider ziemlich satt gesehen. Da bieten andere Titel deutlich höheren Mehrwert."
23928918,"Ho ho, the first time you need to use your sword... Worth the whole game. Fantastic game."
23926682,"This game is fantastic and was the reason I felt I needed to go get a Vive and a new PC. Sure it has some issues like teleporting inside of enemies and it is a little cartoonish for my taste, but the overall experience was amazing. It reminded me of waiting in line for a Disney ride with all the cool environments, but then gave me enemies to kill and space to explore. Great fun and a great into to room-scale VR!"
23921141,亲身砍怪的感觉很爽，推荐！
23920032,"If you like D+D this is a wet dream, the Dev has spent a lot of time getting the feel of the game just right, at the moment it is a first level and a battle arena which is about 2 hours of gameplay, but it is well worth it.  The graphic style is very cartoon based with nice skeletons the combat is nice and simple, it requires a bit of timing rather than the simple ""wiggle my sword in his face"" technique. The weapons are nicely rendered and have a good feel to them, the feed back on the controllers for the vive make contact with items very realistic and does the bow shooting effects.  The world is bright well rendered  and lit to a point where the atmosphere is very captivating.   I highly reccomend giving this game a go as the Dev needs support, this is the right way to make a VR game and he/she needs help to fund the rest of the game, which according to the forums is well on its way.  I give this game a 10/10 and look forward to future content."
23919689,"The most fun I've had in VR so far. My only criticism currently is it's too short. I assume there will be more content released at a later date, since it's still early access."
23915398,"With it's excellent cartoon style reminiscent of what many 16-bit ear games where trying to portray, I found myself drawn into this game world and loved the sense of presence and interation. 
This game is pretty short, but well worth it if you can pick it up on sale. 
Crying out for more levels and items, it make an amazing rouge-like experience if the devs decide to take it in that direction."
23906931,"Hral som to len zo začiatku, tak hodinku a už ma to veľmi chytilo, velmi dobre sú spracované boje, a ja som po hodine zomrel ked som bojoval proti dvom kostlivcom naraz a vzadu mali čarodejníka-healera. Brutal tažke to bolo sa im ubraniť a este ich aj ničiť. graficky a Pribehovo je to dobre spravené, je tam jeden rušivý element, ktorý sa da taktiež aj vypnuť, je že hra ma upozornuje ked niesom v strede miestnosti. Dávam 9/10 :) a ocenenie HTC Vive Must Buy"
23905529,"This is really the best VR game atm... the enemies are quit intimidating and the game has nice weapons and progress so far... I need to finish it... but untill now it is my money well spend already. 

Looking forward to the whole experience... Haptic feedback on the hits would be a nice addition to the gameplay I guess."
23888161,Great
23885949,"If you're looking for a real, full VR game, look no further. Combat is so much fun, especially if you really get into it and go for the parries and jabs. It's currently one of the most incredible experiences for the Vive, and it's my go-to when showing the Vive to my friends. 

Playtime is about 1.5-2 hours, and I've found myself going back through it at least once a week."
23885777,"Realy cool game if you like the dungon crawls.  Lots of weapons, a tool belt to hold invenory."
23883796,"Muito bom! Meu segundo jogo em VR depois de The Lab.
Pra quem gosta de RPG é sem dúvidas uma nova experiencia.
Com cobate de espada, escudo e arco.
Com pequenos segredos apra descobrir durante o mapa."
23881285,Its fun but short. Kinda to short its price.  Needs more levels
23880826,"Amazing game .. shows the power and immersiveness of VR. I would play this all day, every day!"
23880345,"Great start to a great game.  I beat the first part in just over an hour, but I had a blast doing it.  I can't wait for more!!!"
23872550,Great game
23866947,"Like most VR games right now, it's short: taking a little over 2 hours to complete both episodal installments. Which, for the price, isn't much. However it is a great example of how I hope the hack n slash / fantasy genre develops. Art style similar to games like Zelda, the melee fights with monsters feel very intense and in-your-face. You will probably break something in your living room while you're lunging for a skeletons' vital spot. May want to wait for either the price to drop, or more content to be released, but otherwise if you're desperate for VR fun, it may be worth the purchase.

Also, after you've given the shield a try, put it away, buy a second sword and sow a river of carnage. Trust me."
23863506,"ONE OF THE BEST VR GAMES IVE PLAYED!!! great story line, awesome things, first game ive seen where it teleports u back if you try to go through the wall. really reccomend this if your looking for a 2-3 hour game with some legend of zelda type gameplay! 

GG"
23858681,"I don't care if you buy it or not - but worth every dollar... wow man.. very cool!... you get tangled in the wire a bit but the puzzles in the game are good fun, nothing that will strain your brain but enough to be enjoyable with a bit of brain power.. fighting all the giants and different weapons are cool...

Can't wait for the next chapter.. no spoilers here, but I reckon majority of peeps will love this game.."
23854820,"Nachdem ich sehr lange gezögert habe weil RPGs eigentlich nicht mein Fall sind ist dieses Spiel inzwischen zu einem meiner Lieblingsspiele aufgestiegen. Leider ist es etwas kurz und ich muss nun mit leichten Entzugserscheinungen leben ;-)
Ich hoffe die weiteren Kapitel lassen nicht mehr so lange auf sich warten."
23852514,"You love RPGs?
Buy this, end of discussion.

Every fan of games like Morrowind, Gothic, Skyrim, Risen etc. have dreamed about playing a game like this. You will have fun with every sword you block with your own sword or shield, with every corner you explore and every enemy you defeat.

Yes, its short. And yes, chapter two is more about fighting instead of exploring but that should not stop you.
The dev already said, that a third chapter is coming to us, so there is something to get hyped for.

If you like RPGs (and even if you don't) you won't regret this."
23851117,"I'm shirtless in VR, yelling at a skeleton, and flailing around my room wildly.
Wife comes in.
10/10 would humiliate myself again."
23850359,"Really fun experience but also super short.  Wish I could save sections and go back.  I played about 3 hours, but probably could have finished in 45 minuts.  The price is a little high.  Would rather have played installments for $7 each.  My guess they will release a chapter 2 for the same price.  My only complaint!"
23850220,Amazing game - This is fun!
23847557,"Wow.  First off, you have to try this.  The first real RPG style game.  I've played a couple other swordy games, which are more zelda like.  This one has great mechanics.  Swordplay is top notch, some light puzzling.  fun cartoony WoWish graphics.  This is a game where you can play with any size room -- and the designer did a great job with the ""reset to middle"" concept.  You pause and can reorient yourself in your play space to fit the situation.  This is how I got through one of the caves.

The rock mining was a pleasant surprise.... oh please keep developing this.  Can you release a level editor?"
23846858,Awesome introductory game to the Vive! Although a little short at the moment (completed in about 2 hours playing time) it sounds like there are future expansions in the works.  Immerse yourself in the game and have a blast slashing and battling your way through it.
23836355,卧槽！第一人称打怪就是棒！仿佛看到了以后的黑魂！！！
23835089,"I played this game for 30mins, and I do love it so far.
but every game has its ups and downs

the good parts
- combat is done by waving your controllers about like a fat kid on sugar-rush
now with that said, its not just like that, there is a block and attack style to this game.
- weaponswap on the fly
tons of weapons to choose from on the fly, , short sword, bigass wrord, shortbow, longbow, shields and much more
- awesome RPG feel to this game.
it realy feels your in the game
- cute design
this isnt like a gore type of game, so it could be played by anyone I feel, atleast up to this point.
- readable text
not all games are optimized for the Vive/oculus/etc, but this game is, the text is readable

the downs.
- room size
this game requires a 2x2meters, wich I think is wrong, you need atleast 3x3 meters, his is to due with armwaving around, I allready smacked my controller into stuff, so bare minimum of 2x2meters but preferd 3x3 meters, if not bigger
- combat
I said the combat is okay, and it does lack abit on the dificulty here, I found it easy, so far I played, and I do hope they will fix this, specialy when the monsters wait for eachother in combat"
23833121,"This game is amazing, it feels like an actual game rather than the tech demos so popular on the Vive at the moment. It is only about 2 hours long, but hopefully more chapters will be added!"
23826292,"Great game so far! I would recommend a 2m x 2m room for this game, but I was able to play it in even a smaller room. As for any VR game: the room size matters!

Really love the combat system and the puzzle games.
Great atmosphere!"
23819859,"Woowwwww I cant say how amazing this game is!! So much fun, you actually feel like youre an explorer. Awesome storyline- I was able to really get into it with the cool riddles and such. I am still amazed at this game after playing through it. The combat is very very fun (except for when I smashed my hand into the wall XP)... The invemtory system is so freakin intuitive and fun to use. If you have room scale VR, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME. Absolutely amazing and the best Vive game I have played yet."
23819030,Best story based game I have played on the Vive so far. The fighting feels really good. All around good game. I can't wait for the next installment. The game was a little short feeling though.
23814325,One of the best video game experiences I've ever had.
23811902,Currently the best vr experience. A must buy for Vive owners.
23811344,This game definitely feels like it's one of the pioneers of VR games but at the same time it gets much closer to AAA desktop    games. I think developers are on the right track.
23810523,"This is one of the best VR games I've played. I gasped when I first loaded it up in the Vive at what was before me. As it progressed I became more engrossed. It is a simple game full of normal fantasy tropes, but I greatly enjoyed leaning around a corner to fire and hide from incoming arrows. I played this start to finish in a few sittings. You won't regret buying this one."
23808683,"Vanishing Realms es un buen juego, pero considero que puede ofrecer muchíiiisimo más de lo que está ofrenciendo hoy en día. [26/06/2016]

Ojalá algún día mi valoración pueda aumentar, pero de momento es un juego de 15€ que te dura una hora, confiaré en que el estudio incremente su duración y episodios [Cosa que está haciendo, pero no sé hasta que punto van a seguir haciéndolo].

Valoración general: 7/10"
23806288,"This game is the best experience so far in VR (HTC Vive). 

With the moments of shock and awe (and sometimes terror) I feel like I bonded with this game. It's sad to have finished the first chapter of it - having to wait for more. 

The developers have made an ingenious interface and interaction with the world. I have experienced no nausea although my fear of heights have given me tremors. Amusingly this game has also been a good workout!

My play area is a bit small for this game so I tend to get the warning to get in the center of the room, but the game clearly states the minimum size requirements. 

In short: This game will leave you wanting more with a warm fuzzy feeling in your nerdy body."
23805195,This game is good! Really good! I played through the game in two sessions over about 3 bours. I enjoyed every minute of it.  I'm definitely looking forward to new content for it.
23804364,Felt like a VR Zelda title mixed with the aesthetics closer to WoW.
23802672,"This game cost me 570$ 
10/10 would smash TV Again.
MUST have for anybody with a Vive
Kinda like a more scripted version of Torchlight

Give this some randomly generated dungeons and it would be really really cool."
23802415,"Meilleure jeux RPG sur VR, tres agréable et immersif, on en veux toujours plus !!

Best Rpg games on VR, immersive !!"
23801150,"The mechanics come together quite well, resulting in the best possible VR experince. The game drips style and quality, unlike many other early access games. I highly recommend it."
23800390,"Very good game! It's so much fun using your weapons and fighting. I feel like I'm actually there, can't wait to explore futher with this game."
23800249,"Finally a proper action rpg for vive!

Here's my plus and minuses:

+ some cool stories
+ awesome combats
+ decent graphics
+ cool bossfights (bug with the first big boss as i could easily take him from a distance with just bow and arrows)

- didn't like that i couldn't go all the way back to the swords to buy the best for 1000 when i had the money for it (stuck with second best)
- designed for bigger play area as i very often fell out of  bounds and had to resume often

But regardless, finally a cool dungeon game for the vive!
"
23798140,Really digging this game. Easy to pick up and combat is really fun. I may or may not have accidentally punched walls a few times.
23797830,Wow - my first VR game and this was a HOME RUN!  It was so immersive ... I actually screamed and jumped back when a skleton emerged frpm a coffin I had just broken (serves me right for grave robbing!).  My only knock on that game is that it is short ... I completed it in about 3 hours.  I am looking forward to the next chapter.
23797307,"Love, love, love this game.
If you're worried about your room being too small, don't be - Mine is too small and it works just fine.
Definitely the best executed RPG for VR out there.
I only hope the developer will continue adding to it and give us more chapters to enjoy!"
23797300,"第一次玩會覺得很新鮮，但是破關後就不會想玩了，有點可惜

優點:
首個具有RPG要素的VR遊戲
道具系統很新奇，方便使用
使用各種武器和骷髏作戰
美麗的場景

缺點:
遊戲時數過短，重複遊玩性低

如果有無限骷髏競技場模式會更好"
23788679,"Genuinely got scared at my first skeleton, for being the first (i think) game of its type in VR it's very good, some of the graphics could be better (like details in the sacks of grains and the night sky).

This game makes me want to move my gaming station into a bigger room but it's playable with the recommended 2*2 meters. (Atm i play in a weird 2,7 * 1,7 meters setup but it works)

All in all this is great!"
23778195,"This game is what VR (and room scale) is ment to be. I acctualy whinced the first time I got shot with an arrow. DUAL WIELDING with motion control, does anything else need to be said."
23777348,"I'm highly impressed with this game. I tried it out after buying a slew of VR games for the summer sale and couldn't put it down until I beat it. Immediately I came here to write a review because of how great I think this game is! 

Previews and play-throughs don't do VR games justice. I read that this game is too short, or has no re-playability but the combat system is really fun. I plan on playing through this again just because of the combat alone.

The only con I can think of is that most fights heavily guard their left side in the assumption that the player right handed. It is quite a bit easier finding openings as a leftie than rightie. Still absolutely worth buying it though."
23774102,"A real adventure with solid gameplay!  The fun of being able to actually fight something with a sword and shield is amazing!  Eventually you figure out the monster patterns and the game starts throwing groups at you to try and overwhelm you, but those are the only negatives I've seen so far!"
23771613,"This game is the new base for RPG, adventure or puzzle VR games. It is well organized and user friendly. I can say that any other vr game devaloper need to see this game first."
23770223,Amazing RPG!
23768439,"First I will start with the issues I had.

Teleportation no matter where I teleported ended up freezing the game saying I was in a wall... maybe my fault I had a slightly smaller room then requested (2.2x1.6) verus (2x2) 
However once I got to the outside area I couldnt teleport at ALL. I reset, I reconfigured the vive and everyhting else I could thing of, im stuck and then I realized, I paid $15 for this game...

The game:

I do not find it as entertaining as many do. The graphics are Okay nothing to write home about and the battle mechanics were disappointing after reading the other reviews.

Im a 33 year old gamer and I understand Vive is new and that everyone is trying different things.

However and I mean no ill will or to flame the developer.

The game didnt work for me and Honestly I found it boring. If this had been a 2D standard game that I paid $15 for I would have immediatly quite (within 1 or 2 minutes)"
23767748,"This is my favorite VR game so far. It's the first game that actually feels like a traditional, more fleshed-out game experience, rather than some variation of wave shooter to me. Explore, interact, solve puzzles, fight monsters, collect items to upgrade, etc. 
When Nintendo finally makes a VR Zelda, I think they're going to borrow some tricks from Vanishing Realms. 
On that note, Devs, how about a sweet boomerang? Target multiple objects & then throw? Looking forward to updates!"
23766863,"If you have a vive you must own this game. Impatiently waiting for more content but the first 2 chapters remind me of the original Dungeon master from the 80's, only better."
23766024,"well this game held my attention, was on it for hours. Great VR game and must have for the Vive"
23765533,"This is the top game available for the vive right now I can say without question.    It has a huge amount of potential, and I hope the developers will take it to the next level.   While I say it's the top game right now, that's a pretty low bar.  The AI in this game is simplistic and easy.  Once you learn the three basic types of enemies, they are easily defeated.  I didn't die one the entire game, and didn't lose more than 10 health or so at any one point.   The AI needs some tuning, and the game could do with being a bit longer (I finished it in 2 hours)

BUT - all that being said.  The story is great, the maps are done VERY well, the mechanics of the game are SPOT ON.  BRING ON PART TWO!  (But a little longer, please!)"
23765369,"This is an amazing game, Standing toe to toe with a Skeleton Warrior was so exciting as I blocked his strike with my shield, and struck at it's neck as he leaned in to much, I knew my years doing Karate would come in useful for something someday!, Rounding a corner I was fired upon by an Archer and I just ducked behind a large rock in time to hear his arrow whistle by my head, Equiping my bow I leaned out and fired an arrow at him hitting him in the face, It just don't get any better than that, This is a very well designed and I am looking forward to the full release. Must buy for the Vive even in early access you wont be dissapointed."
23764216,"I think I'm one of the few who dislike this product.  Teleportation was not a fun way to get around, monsters back off too much for my tastes, and hit detection was spotty at best.  Longbow also felt really off to me, and the force feedback just wasn't really doing enough for me.  Going up against the King skeleton guy or the big ones with flails, it really felt like I was the one doing the flailing.

I think this will be a refund for me, first of my Vive ownership.

Edit:  Not sure why the above information isn't helpful.  I will add:  Blocking enemy swords with your own sword or shield feels pretty damn good, and blocking arrows with your shield is even better.  However, having an enemy block you (and your hand + sword continuing through your swing unimpeded IRL) creates a disconnect between the VR world and the real.  It simply does *not* feel good.  I can really see how some people would like this game, but the fact is, if it wasn't in VR, it wouldn't be that great of a game, and VR doesn't add as much to it as it does to other games.  It complicates locomotion and causes combat issues.  Yeah, it's immersive as hell, but for this specific genre of game, the tradeoffs aren't worth the immersion gain."
23760671,"挺好玩，就是有点短，期待更新~
还有个问题就是命中和被命中的判定有点迷。。。"
23760381,"Fun game! - the motion controllers are what totally make the experience work: using them as sword/shield/bow makes the combat so much more compelling.  I'm only up to chapter 5 (I think).

A few nits/suggestions to the developers, mostly about inventory management:

* the HUD interface for gear selection needs work - the way it's locked to your eyes based on which way you were looking when you looked down frequently requires me to look back up, then look straight, then look down - very awkward
* having the HUD on look-down messes with the immersion in the game - why not have it pop up on a menu button push?  you spend a lot of time looking down hunting for ruby goblets, etc - the HUD gets in the way
* not having the game pause for inventory management only makes tense combat moments more stressful (not in a good way) - it doesn't feel realistic to be facing off against a surprise enemy and have to.... stare at your feet while caaaaarefully pointing and clicking
* since the game is very linear, i spend a lot of time fretting that i'm missing some secrets, because (it seems) it would be rather onerous to go back - it would be nice to have a generic ""secrets found"" counter or some such to relieve that.  alternatively, you could make the environment more conducive to backtracking (shortcuts back to earlier parts that open once you've successfully completed an area, etc.)
* the torch is a useful enough standard item, i'd like it to have its own separate inventory slot, the way weapons do - maybe with a quick button to toggle it to hand/put it away
* loot collection feels like busywork - maybe just have a trigger pull within such-and-such radius of loot suck it all in - having to touch each piece (particularly when they get obscured by unmovable objects or embedded in fragments) is annoying (it's not like the loot's realistically fallen to the ground - why make me touch each piece?)

All in all, great work so far; keep it up!"
23760010,This game is awesome.  The game play is solid and the world is immersive.  I felt like I was in Warcraft or something.  Definitely one of my favorite VR games.
23759804,"Absolutely cool game, was one of the coolest experience I had in VR, and probably in PC games ever! A little short but I expect further chapters to come. Also, imho, the fights are too easy... Still, I do not regret buying this (not in summer sale :-D ), it's the first real VR game that I played, not just some arcade minigame like Space Pirate Trainer etc.

On a sidenote, if you like this, check out ""Spell fighter VR"", it's free and really cool, once you've familiarized with the weapons and the spells. Much harder enemies and more interesting fights!"
23756226,完全看不懂要怎麼玩，好吧，咱英文只有小學程度
23753715,"I have no idea how that game got so many good reviews. It has potential, a large dungeon to explore and stuff, but it's very raw and I wouldn't recommend buying it at this state.

My biggest problems with it :

- The ""UI"" jumps as you look down, it's not permanently there, you have to look at your stuff to grab it.
- The monsters are Unity assets (not too much of a big deal) With super basic animations (complete dealbreaker)
- The combat system is really poor, there's no good hit detection and with the crappy animations it doesn't feel fun at all.

Refunded."
23751104,"One of the most complete and compelling vive expriences I've played so far.  Took me about two hours to complete, but definitly did not feel short.  Maybe because fighting baddies in this game is quite tiring.  Feels very polished and promises more to come.  If you have a Vive, buy this game.  Also, make sure you have plenty of room and maybe a sweat rag."
23750961,"This takes my pick as the best game on vive atm.

7.5/8

"
23750857,"I absolutely love this game... but the price is too high for the hours you will get out of this.

Pro:
- The one-to-one tracking of hands is great. You get so much freedom with your fighting style and when you block stuff YOUR ACTUALLY BLOCKING IT.
- Love the realism with putting keys in locks to open locked doors and lighting candles with your torch

Con:
- The bow is not that great. The draw length of the bow is too short for me. I end up pulling my hand to 10 cm in front of my body instead of slightly behind. This should be adjustable. Also the anchor point on the controller is a bit to close to the hand so you don't get to draw the bow back correctly.
- Magic is a bit boring. Its just a projectile weapon using Mana as ammo.
- THIS is what changed my review to negative: With about a 2 hour playthough with good but limited gameplay options this game is good - for an early access. But the developer has said that he is about to make the game official and charge for future content. This game is not wide or deep enough to justify $20 price tag. I bought this game expecting much more bang to come from my buck.

Half way though the game I adopted a 2 handed fighting style and loved every second of mahem I rought on my enemies.

Spend a whole day completing this game, enjoying the scenery and marvelling at how awesome it all is. Really looking forward to more content in the future.

I think this game is a fantastic benchmark for future RPG and MMORPG games to follow. I'm thinking... this is what Elder Scrolls 6 should be. Wow that would be so unbelievably epic!

Having said all that, until the developer backtracks on his plans for future content or reduces the price, I can't recommend that people buy this. When I first recommended this game, there were no games like this on VR. Now there are more and more and so I'm less inclined to have VR gamers pay exorbitant prices.

P.S. The developer announced his content plans many months ago. With the lack of further information, it is possible that this game has been abandoned."

都是RPG里的琐事，但配上VR、一切凭双手解决，感觉就是他妈的强啊！盾剑在手硬肛三骷髅才是男人的浪漫！

总之，临场感非常棒，尽管战斗其实还是不完美，AI有点弱智，判定也有偏差，但比目前那些免费垃圾不知道高到哪里去了
卜谈了，才打完第一关，死宅现在已经要累死了_(:з」∠)_"
23742753,Upto now this has been my best gaming proper experience with vive. Its so much more than most of the games being released. An absolute must for all Vive owners.
23742380,"This is a relatively large, buggy, cartoonishly fun VR game. No idea where they got their cover art though. It's nowhere near as serious as it looks. Get ready to dodge traps, swing sword, shoot arrows, cast spells, and block attacks in a big (For VR) world. You can still see everything and do everything in one setting, but for everything that's included, it's a hell of a lot of fun and well worth the price. 

Just make sure you play through it in one sitting as there are some weird glitches with progress if you quit out of it. I would also recommend having a fairly large playspace as well as you'll be moving around quite a bit."
23742034,"This game shows the promise of VR like nothing else I've tried. 

Pros: 
-Absolutely the most incredible experience I've had on the Vive! 
-For those of you with lower-end graphics cards. I was able to run this on a gtx 750ti with about 75% of the game at full frame rate. It got a little jittery in the forest, but was managble. 
 Cons:
-More please!

Bottom line: Worth every penny. Do youself a favor and get it."
23741507,"Fun and immersive, but all in all lacking the narrative necessary to make it truly memorable. What little narrative there is is presented through text, which is not exactly the ideal medium for VR storytelling. Combat is excellent, if a little easy. I can't wait for a more fully emerged game to come out from these guys. In the end, worth $19.99, and especially worth it if it's on sale."
23740793,"The game really sucked me in, I wasn't too sure about it at first, I was wondering how swordplay was going to play out. Despite the obvious feedback of weapons clashing, it felt so good.

My most memorable moment so far in it isn't even the boss fights that have cropped up, I was surrounded by three normal skeletons, each of them swinging at various intervals, I had one blocked with my shield out while I parried the other two with my sword and struck when I had an opening. It was intense and at some point during this scuffle I wound up tearing my room down.

10/10 would destroy room while fighting skeletons for my life again."
23740725,"Wow!  And to expand upon that, wowwwwww!  If you have any love whatsoever for dungeon games, get this.  EOL."
23737115,"Mundo bonito de explorar, los enemigos de tu tamaño son divertidos de combatir, los bosses, las armas etc está bastante bien y funciona de perlas el VIVE...lo único que me gustaría es un poco más de agresividad en los enemigos pero bueno aún así es divertido el combate como he dicho...muy recomendable"
23737114,"This game sold me on VR, very atmospheric. Only 2-3 hours long but it's probably the best preview of the epic games to come for VR in the next few years."
23736595,LOVE this game. Such a cool feeling to be in this world. Definitely well worth the money! Only thing is I beat the game pretty quick =/ now its time to wait for the new content...
23735966,great game. really immersive and fun to play. could be better in a lot of different ways but it's the best thing going for VR right now.
23731613,"What everyone else said. Game has much potential and little to be upset about. 
About 2 hours to get through the 2 chapters.
I got my moneys worth."
23731488,"Played through in one sitting. One of the best games for the VIVE available now, top quality gameplay with fun mechanics, and a great VR-experience."
23728370,"You will believe, utterly, that you are within the dungeons of Vanishing Realms.  You will crap your pants when a skeleton charges at you from the darkness.  You will peek your head over barrels to see what's inside, and you will feel like a complete badass as you sword and board your way through throngs of baddies both indoors and out.

This game will eventually need to offer substantially more content for the price, but it's designed ground-up for VR and the experience itself is very solid as of today.  The interface is fluid and gameplay is very polished for an Early Access title.

The developer seems active and reasonably engaged, so I have confidence the title is under active development and will expand over time, but at this point, for this price, you're taking it on faith that more will be added.  Playthrough time aside, this is one of the best VR showcase games on Steam, and it's a must-have to see where the medium is headed, and especially for the wow factor when demoing your rig to family and friends."
23723513,"Fun, could use a little tweaking. The game itself was fun, all up to the part where you have to kill monsters in waves. If I could skip that then maybe I would keep going but I am not a fan of waves in an RPG game. Unfortunately I have to get past the waves to keep going so for now I can't recommend the game.

However with that said, the gameplay is fun and the game is good looking."
23717617,"I love the combat in this game so much!  I also have an annoying VR problem that I freak out whenever anything life size comes to attack me.  I think this game is helping with that somehow to!  
  Awesome game with little content, so I am excited for more updates!"
23709659,Good story for the first consumer VR units. Its a little short but still a great buy. I cannot wait to look back at this like I do at Pitfall now.
23703471,Not enough content for the price.
23701273,"The experience is reasonably polished but I burned through the whole thing in about 1.5 hours. When comparing the price to the content this is the only game where I have felt significantly ripped off (and I own selfietennis as well).

Maybe I have unreasonable expectations but I feel it is just WAY too short for the price tag. Particularly when you compare it to the other titles available..."
23698800,"Probably the best VR game I own for the VIVE.  Sure, the graphics aren't triple-A grade. But this was literally made by ONE PERSON. That, to me, is incredible. If one guy can do all this, just imagine what VR will be once big companies buy into this. Anyways, the graphics quality doesn't even matter when the level of immersion is this high. You actually feel like a rookie adventurer, every action you make in reality, you make in virtual reality. I first sucked at combat because I was getting used to it, just like a rookie adventurer and I enjoyed every minute of it all. The combat, interface, and exploration is enough to distract you from the game's cons itself, even if there's a few glitches on the way. So if your asking yourself ""Should I buy this?"" Ask yourself first, ""Do I have a VIVE?"" If the answer is yes, then buy this immediately. If the answer is no, go buy a VIVE and play this.

Also, did I mention this was made by ONE GUY?"
23697578,"I Love this game, other developers should look at this as example of very solid VR game. Now only if we could have an MMO like this with a lot more content."
23696531,"My fiancé an I really enjoyed playing through the first episode. The fighting and navigation are quite intuitive, and the monsters are so much scarier in VR! We had some minor gripes, but definitely recommend this to anyone with a Vive! Check out our full video review here: https://youtu.be/CL4niH_7-38"
23693263,"Great game for the Vive. I would recommend it to anyone first picking up the system and those that love fantasy combat.
 Below is a list of Pros and Cons for me personally. Maybe it'll be helpful to you. Overall, I loved the experience, and just nitpick a bit here.


Pros:
-Combat feels awesome, especially when you have multiple enemies engaging you at once
- World looks good, and the atmoshere is nice
-Teleporting mechanic doesn't take you out of the immersion (unless you blink around like a dingus)
- Stats and user interface are easy to understand
- Puzzles and clues are neither too challenging, nor too simple
- Hidden items/easter eggs are fun to look for here
- Distinctly different weapons for various situations
-Some enemy variety

Cons:
- Switching to the bow can be difficult at times
- The wand weapon that you get is simply too powerful. It makes clearing the final boss incredibly easy if you have maxed out your mana.
- Enemies do not pursue the player aggressively enough
- Combat doesn't scale up fast enough (by about 30 minutes in you should be able to kill everything with little issue, unless you are swarmed). Enemies need to attack faster.
- Enemies are fairly similar in regards to combat behavior. Would like to see more behaviors, or something simple like some skeleton warriors having their sword+shield hands switched.
- The final boss lost some of his wow and scare factor after figuring our this pattern. Needs some more attack patterns to make him more challenging.
- The sequence of trials after the main quest is kind of fun... but overall not challenging enough at that point or as engaging as the rest of the game.
- It takes a good amount of time for you to face your first enemy... like longer than you need it to be. It makes it sometimes hard to show it to friends, as they can't drop right into the action.

Bottom line, it is not perfect, but it is quite good. Please purchase this and have a fun VR experience!"
23682276,"To be honest, i had alot of fun with this game,  while short, fun, just wish there were some unarmored enemies that you can just SMASH, for that rpg powertrip i was looking for. too many times i just went for a stab and it just gets blocked randomly. Still a fun concept though. Yes, yes i know early access and all. its not a finished game and can't be judged like one. another thing i disliked was the bow, it just felt lackluster, with a sword or a hammer you get that BAM feeling and feedback, with the magic staff you get that lovely KABOOM, but the bow was very meh. Otherwise good game."
23682003,"Great example of what can be achieved with room scale VR and a fun, immersive experience I can easily recommend.
The sword fighting aspect is good but doesn't feel as natural as it could, seems this might be related to how the enemy hit zones are structured but expect this can easily improve with development which I hope to see soon!"
23677104,vanishing dome
23674580,"I've just completed the first 2 chapters which is currently as far as the early access goes and have to say, this game is superb. 

The combat is excellent although quite simple at present. This is by far the best VR experience I have had sofar. The sense of scale is impressive and the interaction with the environment is great. Everything feels intuitive, you pick up an object and put it in your belt. You look at your belt and pick up what's there. You parry a blow and reposte while the enemy is staggered or go for a quick thrust after a block with your shield, it all makes sense and works.

As far as improvements, I would like to see a little more depth to the combat (the animations are brilliant and really highlight how the enemy will attack however after you've gone through a few it is quite easy. Also if you get in close to the bosses they struggle to hit you with some attacks (even without needing to block or parry).

For the price, I'd say if you like the fantasy genre and want to experience VR the way it's meant to be, grab it. I can't wait to see what they have instore for future updates and improvements."
23668182,"Super jeux, un des meilleurs pour l'instant, j'attend la suite avec impatience!"
23665637,My favorite VR experience.  In a class of it's own.
23664858,"A great game that shows where VR could be going. I would recommend it to anyone interested in complex (if ""gamey"" rather than simulationist) combat, dungeon delving, and some light puzzle solving.

I completed the game in just over an hour and a half, which makes it on the shorter side for a game of this price. However, that would be comparing it to games played on a screen, vs. the experience you get here in VR. And boy does it pay off. Performing each swing and block, aiming every shot, and grabbing every lever is quite different from just pressing buttons to ""use"", ""attack"", ""block"", etc. The exchange of blows and blocks felt good, if a little easy (feeling generously telegraphed) by the end. I felt the pressure of being flanked in combat, and the instant fear of arrows coming from an unknown source (which you are able to quickly track down by sound, naturally). Still, I'm itching to see more.

I do like a lot of the mechanics introduced for the VR medium. If you stick your head into something, your vision blurs, or you're pushed back into an open space. Nice. The teleportation movement system works well enough, though I must say I quite enjoyed the more natural movement used in Spell Fighter once I got over the initial disorientation.

The only major complaint I would have is that the game seems to be designed for someone much shorter (I'm 6'4""/193cm and tend to tower over other Hover Junkers players). There are many low ceilings (namely in the arena) and the space feels constrained, even though I have a generous space and stayed away from the Chaperone walls. The game automatically pauses if you try to push too far outside of reach, which became an annoyance at certain points in grabbing objects or attacking some enemies, given my long reach. Default combat distance seems to be incredibly close, and enemies tend to engage me right in my face, far within the reach of my sword, not the kind of distance I like to be at while fencing! Engaging the archers in melee was also annoying as they appeared to only come up to my knees and I had to golf swing to take them out; helmets blocked any reasonable swing I would normally take. Certainly I wouldn't say to skip the game if you are tall, but it's one thing to expect, and hopefully will be changed with future development."
23663697,"THIS GAME. THIS IS THE GAME I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. YOU NEED THIS GAME. In all seriousness, If you like dungeon crawlers and Legend of Zelda, this is definatly the game for you. It mixes the right amount of puzzles with combat. I played for 2 hours non-stop and I had to type this. I can't wait for the future updates."
23662411,"When I talk about VR to my friends, this is the game I always bring up. I really do hope for more."
23662112,"This game surprised me, I did not expect to like it as much as I do.  I paused a couple of times to just look around and laugh with joy at the feeling that I was stepping into the future of gaming."
23657956,"This is one of the very best initial HTC Vive releases.  A lot a fun.  You really do feel like you are inside a (cartoon) RPG.  It's fairly easy, but has some good spooky bits and a giant swinging a huge flail at you.  It plays through pretty quickly, but that's what the promised."
23657256,"Hallo Zusammen,

nach einigem Ausprobieren sämtlicher VR Inhalte auf Steam, kann ich dieses Game ruhigen Gewissens weiterempfehlen. Eines von wenigen Games mit Aha Effekt. So muss VR sein und ich freue mich schon auf mehr content. Die Bewegungsabläufe der Kämpfe sind ein wenig langsam aber dennoch bin ich ins Schwitzen geraten. Die Immersion ist fantastisch. Definitiv ein Must Have. Haut rein :-)"
23651315,Nice Role Playing due to VR experience. Atmospheree is very good.
23649305,Great start to Explorer adventure D & D. Recomended purchase.
23646168,"Legend of Zelda meets FPS meets VR. It's really cool, but short in its current state. Really looking forward to this game growing and evolving in the future."
23645848,体验时间太短了~真不过瘾。除去收集东西之外，战斗过程中那种连击虐怪，格挡反击的快感也是独一无二的~~别问我怎么连击...这可以不是↑↑↓↓←→←→ABAB就连击了...你得自己看准空隙，然后快速出剑。PS：我还是很喜欢用剑反射射过来的箭~
23643852,Good
23642292,"I quite enjoyed this.  An hour of fun.

Tip:  hold your sword high and make a downard stab to get around nearly all armor."
23641260,"One of the best games i've played yet on the Vive, The combat is so fun and the game is well thought out from begining to end. 

Bravo sir, bravo! Now bring chapter 2 please :P"
23640513,"Quelle joie d'explorer, chercher des trésors, combattre des monstres sur le htc vive. Bonne precision des coups et d'immersion! A faire de toute urgence !"
23640207,"This is one of the best room-scale VR games I've played. It only a couple hours of play, and not much in the way of replay value, but you'll have fun. 

It reminds me a lot of the original Shadowgate, though it's nowhere near that deep. Still, if you want to dive into a dungeon, sword fight with skeletons, and gather treasure, it's a great game. 

Don't forget to look everywhere for loot if you want to buy the best stuff."
23637403,This is a must experience for Vive owners. Not the best replayablity but worth every penny just for the experience!
23631221,4時間位でクリアできるが、今のところ一番面白かった！
23628049,A really fun RPG in VR similar to a Legend of Zelda. I wish it had more depth and was much longer. I really couldn't get enough of the this game though. I'm hoping that the dev either adds more content or another episode soon. I can't wait to explore more of this dark and beautiful world.
23623375,"This is the first game I bought after I got my Vive, and it's the first I played all the way through.  The combat, while simplistic, is the best part of the game.  The fact you can smack a skeleton in the face with a sword using your own two hands will make the 10 year old in anyone squeel with glee.

This game is already a must have, and can only get better with more patches and content."
23623182,Can't wait for more. This game is the game that demos the Vive the best. The entire family loved it. Great job people.
23623056,"It's ultimately a great first step toward a VR RPG. I didn't finish it in my first session, and was excited to pick up where I left off to finish the game. I think that says enough."
23619518,Great Game that is fun and very imersive. I highly recommend it if you enjoy a good dungon crawl :-)
23618427,"Hab jetzt mal das erste Level beendet und muss sagen, wow endlich mal mehr als nur eine kleine Techdemo.
Vanishing Realms ist leider das erste Spiel wobei mir ein wenig schlecht wurde :( Aber das trübt den Spielspass nicht im geringstens :)

Steuerung:
Typisch für VR (HTC VIVE) man befindet sich in seinem virtuellen Raum und Teleportiert sich durch die Welt. 
Die Gitterlinien sollte man aber aktiviert lassen, dass man nicht dauernd gegen die Wand /Tisch /Schrank/TV oder so schlägt/läuft :)
Ausweichen der Gegnerrischen Pfeile / Feuergeschosse passiert ganz intuitiv :)
Die Waffen fühlen sich sehr gut an, wobei das Trefferfeedback noch überabreitet werrden müsste. 
Das Blocken funktioniert auch tadelos mit Schwert/Hammer /Schild.

Zum Spiel:
Man löst kleine Rätseleinlagen, wie Schlüssel suchen, Schalter betätigen und Bosse eliminieren.

Als ich das erste mal vor einen Gegner stand, hatte ich mich gar nicht heran getraut, gut das die Gegner erst ab einer bestimmten Entfernung einen angreifen. Habe mich auch immer wieder dabei erwischt wie ich aus der sicheren Entfernung die Gegner beschossen hatte (Zauber/Pfeile) dooferweiße weichen die Gegner irgendwann den Pfeilen aus und Mana hat man auch nicht unbegrenzt :) Also ist man irgendwann darauf angewiesen in den Nahkampf zu gehen. Und das ist absolut beeintruckend!

Fazit: Das Mittendringefühl ist der Hammer, Die Kämpfe machen Spaß und das Erkunden (Looten, etc) macht sehr viel Spaß. Einziges Manko für mich war das nicht 100 prozentige Trefferfeedback bei den Gegnern (aber vertretbar:) ) und das ich bei diesen Titel leichtes motion sickness bei mir herausbeschwört, bisher aber zum Glück der einzige Titel :)

Also Absolute Kaufempfehlung! :)  


"
23616803,"I thought I would really like this game, but for a couple reasons it was very disappointing to me.  

The first reason is the lack of non teleport movement.  I understand that teleporting is supposed to reduce motion sickness and discomfort at the cost of immersion, but in this game I don't think teleportation is helping.  While traversing and fighting monsters in this game you will want to  take many small teleports rapidly in sucession.  This ends up resembling a slideshow.  I find this to be very disorienting and motion sickness inducing.  A more traditional smooth movement would be much much preferable to me.

My second problem is that I was not a fan of the design and art in the game.  I expected it to feel more atmospheric and epic in scale.  Instead it felt like a retro adventure game that I somehow became trapped in.  Typical lever pulling puzzles, linear map design, and very uninspired environments.

That said, the game is quite functional and has some cool stuff to offer.  I'm sure some people will enjoy it far more than I did.  I also think that the price is fair, and if there was another movement option available I think I would enjoy spending more time playing the game."
23614599,"This game isn't finished, but it has a ton of potential from what's currently available.

Pros:
-The first real RPG style game with some decent meat on the bone
-Interacting with the world is immensely satisfying, even something as simple as unlocking doors with a key felt awesome
-Very polished, I encountered no bugs on my playthrough
-The progression & pacing are just right

Cons:
-Graphics are passable, but nothing I'd write home about
-$20 is pretty steep for what you get right now, but if more is added, it has the potential to far outweigh that cost in value
-Sadly the combat was the weakest point of the game, it's just not where it needs to be yet.  Enemy hitboxes are baffling, enemy combat AI is rudimentary at best, defending is laughably easy, and there's just no satisfaction when you hit anything.


Other:
-I'm not a fan of the teleportation locomotion, as it makes abusing fights really easy.  I know there aren't many options available right now, but hopefully more options are explored in the future
-You don't have to stand still while using the bow & arrow, remember about roomscale!  Use this to your advantage and peek around corners"
23614163,"This is still my favorite Vive title to date. The atmosphere, art work and game mechanics are all top notch. I also heard it was a single developer effort which makes it truly mind blowing."
23609993,"Best game I've played so far with the Vive. Great immersion, as other people said the second part is not as mindblowing as the first, but still enjoyable.
The inventory system is mint, I cannot think of a better one. The overall atmosphere is fantastic. 
The part with the water (not telling more, not to spoil) and the fact that the dungeon wasn't only interior but has some exteriors were, for me the best part of the experience.
What I'd like to see (besides more episodes, of course :p) is :
    more animations for the skeletons, 
    more skeletons types (There is only three types of standard, and two huge types if I remember well). 
Would be super fun if a plot was added, for example involving a npc fighting with the player and leading the player to some kind of plot.

This I just mention for the dev to state what part of this game he will develop next from gamers advices. 
But for those who haven't tried it, if you ever dreamt of swinging sword, magic and arrows in a dungeon surrounded by skeletons, this is it. 
You can live exactly that."
23608254,Best game on vive currently imo. 2nd chapter sorta feels like a cop out vs the 1st but still enjoyable none the less. I just want more of this game or games like this. This game shows the potential of VR.
23607970,"It's a short experience (as everyone else is saying) for the money, but worth it as an intro to how immersive VR can be and introduces a lot of cool mechanics, like the swordfighting with skeletons, bow and arrow battles with skeletons, and the inventory system."
23607803,"Looking forward to the next chapter.  This was the first VR game to make me say ""Wow""."
23607756,"This is the must-play experience in VR for any serious VR enthusiast.

It requires some commitment.   It is big in there.   Just moving through the tutorial at a leisurely pace requires a solid hour.   But it is such a seamless and perfect tutorial that you don't even realize you just started the ""real game"" when that first hour whizzes by!

Definitely one to schedule time for.     But the same way that you schedule time for any serious gaming experience.  

Swing your sword, shoot your bow, eat your food, collect your loot.

Perfect!

Get in here!"
23605686,目前为止玩过的最好玩的VR游戏没有之一，嗯
23605228,Very well done dungeon crawling experience.  Can't wait for more development content.
23600970,"Basically ZeldaVR, puzzles are fun, sword play and combat is solid. The only thing missing is more content (it's pretty short) but that's understandable given it's early access and stil in developement. Excited to play more!"
23596310,"Currently one of the best games out for VR that gives an immersive experience and feels like a ""full game"" (except for being short).  Great looking environments, the combat can get slightly repetitive, but the VR experience still makes it entertaining."

23591727,Definitely one of the best Vive games out there. Fully emersive. Perfect use of the vive controllers. Cant believe one Guy finished it in 8 month. A true must have.Would love a part 2. roughly 4 hours gameplay.
23578032,"The first real example of a full fledged RPG style game on the Vive.  Great room scale exploratoin, great sword play.  Nice art style.  Sword play may seem a bit spammy at first, but it has some nice depth.  Use your sword or shield to block enemies and counter attack.  Later enemies require more patter recognition and clever use of equipment/teleport mechanic.  

I can't wait for more chapters but even as is, this game is completely worth $20."
23577427,"A very short game, with a very simple dungeon crawler mechanics, but with the added value of VR here makes it one of the most powerful in-game experiences for me ever. A great start, keep it up."
23577333,"So far, probably the best value I've seen in a paid VR game! Combat is challenging and fun, enjoyable exploration and adventure, and the item storage is comfortable making it easier to change gear on the fly for dynamic changes in battle.

Likely the top VR experience I've had to date.

*If you have chandiliers or other hanging objects in your room... I suggest extreme caution*"
23575518,"Own a Vive? Then you need to own this! Had an absolute blast playing this. Word of warning, make sure you have enough room around you to swing a cat or you'll end up hitting the wall with you nice new controller.  As with all VR games, don't judge by the screen shots, nothing beats wacking a skelly who's nearly the same height as yourself! x"
23575333,"This is the best experience VR so far. I played this game the first day I got my HTC vive and it is still the one I would recommend to my friend. It's a true RPG experience, the movement/teleport system is one of the best (very reactive) amongst all VR game out there, it has no bug, and the ennemies have a very nice IA. The chekpoint save system is very good for this kind of game. Unforutnately, it's a bit short (for now)."
23571621,THIS is what VR supporters have been waiting for. WOW
23560210,Best game on the Vive.  Still very short but hopefully that will change.  Made me feel like my Vive purchase was worthwhile.
23553742,"I was hesistant to buy this game, but someone described it as if entering a Zelda game.. so i bought it thinking i could use the refund option if it wasnt good enough. The game is absolutely worth the money, even if it is short right now. I look forward to see its future development. The bow combat is awesome, the sword combat is so far good but could really be improved. i hope the final game will conatin lots of secrets and a more fleshed out world."
23547830,this is on record the BEST game ive played on vr. it is very fun!!!!!!!!
23544277,"Unbelievable; i love it. If you've only ever had seated experiences you're really in for a treat :)

My specs are i5 2500k GTX 970 4GB 16GB and it runs perfectly. i am not entirely sure why their stated specs are so high.

I've played this with the 2500k at stock speeds and at 4.5ghz and either was perfectly fine :)"
23539261,"I usually don't write reviews but I'll make an exception because after a month of owning the Vive, I can say this is the only real adventure game so far... Or let's say the first two levels of a real game.
It suits VR perfectly, it run smoothly and without distortion so it doesn't give sickness. Everything in this game is well made.
I tried a lot of games and if some demos are promising (like budget cuts), this game is the one I always consider as the reference of what an (adventure) VR game should be like.
Anyway, it is short, it is quite expensive considering there are only two levels but this is the best adventure game available for the Vive... and by far."
23530745,"I'm no swordfighter, but this is a great game! I learned my enemies weaknesses through observation. I started learning their moves and getting an idea of where to duck, block, and strike! I got the workout of my life. I've seen a few VR games - this is the one you want for action, adventure, exploration, and feeling like you really owned your fights. You can hide from arrows or block them with your shield. Try taking on more than one opponent at a time for a real challenge!

Although the graphics are a bit cartoony, the enemies feel as if they are really there as a formidable threat. I found myself just admiring the scenery.

There is only one negative that really bothered me. If you get too close to the edge of your boundary, the view goes dark and asks you to move to the center. This was invasive and completely took the immersion away - especially when you are in the middle of a battle. I would recomend at least letting us see the current scene (darkened?) while guiding us on where to stand."
23530068,"This game is so much fun! If you have a vive and want a semi-story based game then this is worth it. It is kind of short though, I have gotten 3 hours in it so far but i believe that it is going to be released in chunks walking dead style. But that is still 3 hours for 20$, yo7u pay 20$ to watch a 2hr movie that isnt even in VR."
23528592,"Ich habe nun 13 Vive-Games, aber Vanishing ist das MIT ABSTAND beste Spiel. Und es ist das erste Spiel, was sich auch so anfühlt und nicht wie ne Demo.
Ein absolutes Must-have!

Meine derzeitigen Top 5 sind:

GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANZ klare Nummer1: Vanishing Realms
2: Pool Nation VR
3: Cloudlands
4: Job Simulator
5: Tilt Brush

ansonsten besitze ich noch theBlu, the Gallery, the visitor, Fantastic C., the Lab, waltz of wizard, Rexodus und Project Cars"
23526685,This is currently my favorite game in VR. Great job guys! Keep it up.
23526642,"Well done. Intuitive interface. Weapons and mechanics were very realistic. Buy this game so there will be more content! I cannot say enough good things about this game.

Minor suggestions:
-Looking down at the belt to see health can be a bit troublesome since the weight of the headset moves and blurs the image. I believe there is supposed to be no health bar visible so as not to interfere with the environment. It was not a very big issue though.

-I was unsure if stopping and starting would save all progress after a save point so I would jus stay in game when I had to leave. Perhaps a save option in the pause screen.

-A guantlet mode might be great until the next chapter.
"
23525303,Great start for an early access game
23523647,Excellent game. Top 3 of the best VR games I've experienced.
23523535,"I played a little of this game and my 14 year old daughter got to the end.  We loved it.  The movement is great, the gameplay is fun with great atmosphere.  We really hope to see more of this."
23523506,"Wow, I've only played an hour in this game with the HTC Vive.. and well, I'm blown away!
All those childhood dreams of yielding a sword and board, using bows to snipe enemies, exploring and using the environment as protection.. it's all here..! Well recommend it, most fun I've had so far with VR."
23522063,"Eins der besten Spiele die es für die Vive gibt. 
Auch wenn es gerade leider noch sehr kurz ist (ca. 2 Stunden wenn man nicht nur rusht),
macht es unglaublich viel Spaß.
Ich freue mich sehr auf die volle Version des Spiels 
und kann es nur jeden ans Herzen legen.
"
23520531,"I don't understand how this was the top Vive game, sorted by user reviews, when I purchased it.  It has some great ideas, and certain things, like the inventory system, that are well done.  However, there are some major issues with the game.  Most importantly, the hit detection and canned animations of the enemies make it so that the swordfights don't feel natural at all.  It would be much more believable if the enemies' movements were at least a little physics based.  Another problem I had is that this is the first adventure game I bought for the Vive, and I have come to the sad realisation that game genres that work with a standard mouse, keyboard and monitor setup, are less enjoyable when adapted for VR (those poor Oculus owners, that's all they have)."
23519239,"Inventory and weapons felt great to use. The world was fun to look at and explore. Enemies felt large and imposing.
However:
The AI could be more aggressive in chapter 2. The puzzles were interesting, but small. Overall it felt pretty short."
23518340,我很喜欢玩这个游戏，推荐给大家，价格公道，制作非常精致，每个环节都很美妙，就是关卡的怪少了点种类，不过魔幻效果很吸引人，从收集细小的食品、物品、金币，到采矿攒金杯，都很好玩，如果收集的食品可以吃，吃完能加血就好玩了，我收集了一大堆水果、奶酪都不知道有什么用，最后买东西（弓箭、神杖、盾牌）还是要钱啊！不过采水晶矿很过瘾，打开棺木突然出来个骷髅也吓了我一跳，好玩！就是想知道用神杖打开那个门后为啥一直飘在空中看那些城市，是结束了吗？哦，顺便说一下，就是这个不知道是游戏问题还是我的问题，我经常会被暂停，告诉我回到房间中心点重新开始，也许是光学定位仪的缺陷吧！ 有时候正在打怪，突然停下来，非常影响我的情绪，然后再进去就被砍了一刀！
23515909,"3 years have passed since i purchased this game for 20€ with the promise of further content coming over the years. 3 years passed and now come a DLC with a price of 10€ - forget it!

Rating updated to reflect development... 


Below is what I wrote in my review of this game back on 12 Jun, 2016 @ 9:34am:
Best VR game I have played to date. Is a must have for any Dungeon Crawler fans!

I am looking very much forward to further content and please provide a level editor, I want to build my owne dungeon for others to try."
23515893,"This is the future of gaming.  WOW.  If you have a Vive, buy this immediately.  You will not be disappointed."
23514884,"This game blow all other VR experiences for me. I've been playing VR for nearly 2 years (DK2) but the first time i played this with the vive and proper room scale i was blown away. Presence is all around you, i felt like playing inside the all Darstalker game from megadrive time! Take your time, don't rush the experience because it goes fast but being inside is really something else!"
23512327,"Vanishing Realms, more than any other game I have tried on the Vive, really showcases the possibilities of VR.

So many small cool little things here, especially when it comes to inventory management. Picking up fruit and eating it is as natural an action as it can get in Vanishing Realms, where in other games it would be a bizzare set of buttons and menu options. Finding a key for a door literally involves picking up a torch, poking around corners, and finding it in the world. 

So many things work exceptionally well, blocking arrows with your shield is amazing. Magic feels like magic."
23511716,Very fun game . Totally worth it. Love the bows.
23511666,I really enjoyed what I have played so far well worth the money can't wait for more. Its nice to have someone not gauging people for a short exprience like other vive games this is excellent even as is but the dev is going to be adding more content.
23510110,My first review on Steam.  Ill keep it short.  This is a must have for VR.  The Vive combined with the ease of use combat and movement made this game an amazing experience for me.  Loved it and cant wait for more.
23509849,"A hugely entertaining hack, slash and zzap adventure. 

You no longer control your hero. 

You ARE the hero!

Every swing, block, loot pickup, spell, arrow is done by you. The immersion is wonderful, despite the cartoony graphics. Looking forward to future updates. 

Right now the most polished VR dungeon crawler experience you can buy."
23508389,"Um. 10/10 Like Skyward Sword with functional controls.
There's something internally rewarding about jabbing a skeleton right in the face, dead above his raised shield and just below the brim of his helmet.

Like most things in VR, it's a lot more fun to actually be in there than it looks."
23504846,"This game is so much fun!
With more content, this game for the VIVE would be like what Zelda was for the gameboy"
23500675,"Pros:
- Totally immersive environment
- Zero motion sickness
- 'Real life' sword fighting! Yay!
- Works OK even in smaller than recommended rooms (mine is 2.3x1.7)

Cons:
- Wish the textures were Skyrim like :D"
23500243,"很好玩, 真的很有身在地城的感覺 ,可惜目前只有2個章節 , 過完9波就沒了...."
23498561,"Amazing game - starts off a bit slow, but pickups and is just amazing from there!"
23495823,"I loved the game. One of my if not the favorite game so far on ViVe. An incredible adventure and an amazing concept for a VR game. About the only issue i had with the game was that combat, you wait for opoment to atack and you atack him. Reality is, I don't see how it could have been done otherwise. A Great game without a doubt."
23495047,"This game is good.  The puzzles are easy.  I was a ways into it, collecting some gold and a skelly pops up out of a coffin behind me and I didn't notice it.  I turn around because im' losing health to see this 7 foot skelaton slashing me like right behind me.  I actually jumped back and forgot it wasn't real for a second.  it was really cool.   The best vr game so far imo would reccomend."
23494832,One of my favorite vive games to date. If you love RPGs then this is the closest thing that you can get right now to actually being in one. Excellent. Cant wait for chapter 3!
23492481,Really well done.
23490892,"Wow.

This is easily one of the best Vive titles I've played. It makes me feel like I'm back in my past playing Zelda on the Super NES for the first time.

The UI is fantastic, so easy to figure out. I quickly picked up the knack for picking up items and storing them on myself.

The level design is wonderful, simple enough, but not that it isn't interesting. I've really enjoyed walking around and exploring all the sights, and you have to, there are many stashed treasures to find.

Combat is simple enough, but perfect for room scale. It's not daunting to face your opponent after the initial contact, I get the feeling of playing older games, where you have to work out the attack patern and counter it to win.

Vanishing Realms leads you in slowly, educating you on how everything works and what you need to do to continue and succeed.

I could gush about this game all day.

If you own a Vive, treat yourself and buy this awesome game. If you haven't bought a vive and are going to, make this game one of your first buys.

I can't wait to get back in there... I feel like I'm in dungeon and dragons or something...

"
23490857,Ce jeu est juste formidable. Très imersif. Très fun.
23486346,"Incredibly fun.  This is certainly one of the best VR experiences I have had.  My only complaint is it was so fun that I completed the game before I knew it.  Around 2 hours of gameplay, but certainly worth the money.  I'll probably end up replaying sometime in the near future, and I look forward to any updates the developers may add.  If there are more chapters added, I will be one of the first to play them.   10/10 would get angry at virtual skeletons again."
23485730,"非常有意思的一款作品,期待着后续...  整片给人一种全新的角色扮演游戏感觉.."
23483891,"The game starts off looking like a simple average tunnel/ room game, 
Then after you go to your first outdoor area and start swinging your sword and aiming your bow and arrow, its great.

Love the Blink movement for zero Motion sickness, love the puzzles and enemies..

Very good example of VR done briliantly."
23477886,"What limited content there is so far is tons of fun, HOWEVER, the game is currently not balanced at all. There are currently a half-dozen or so ways to exploit serious flaws in the enemy AI. As an Early Access game, though, these flaws are understandable for now."
23477071,"Finally I get to be in the Tomb of Horrors ....well at least as close is I can for now, this game is a good example of whats to come...sure it need some tweaking, but feel ""of being there"" makes up for the simplicity of the game. but they seem to be on the right track, from the menu to your inventory box's
Its a must if you have the vive"
23474531,Nemá obdoby. Jste ve fantasy světě. Příběh není nejdelší ale o to je nápaditější. Baví baví a baví. Bomba!!
23474406,"As of 2016-06-09, this game is absolutely not worth it. Perhaps in the future, but definitely not now.

The enemies have like 3 attacks, and on top of that the hit boxes are WAY WAY WAY TOO STRICT., You can ONLY damage the enemies when they are good and ready for it, and you can ONLY damage them if you hit them square in the middle of the hitbox. The story is pretty forced, like they use fancy poetrry to give insttructions that are either way too obvious to completely confusing... not to mention that a challenge of steel is considered an integral part of the story (aka, ""we need to pad the story so put in an arena to buy us some time""

This EARLY ACCESS game shows promise, and is one of the only current VR games on Steam that even attemps to have a story. It's a solid proof of concept, and *could* turn into something awesome. But as of right now, it seems like another company will take this concept and perfect it."
23467307,还行吧，流程有点短，游戏内容过于简单，但是做的还算是蛮精致的
23462608,"This is a pretty great game.

It's definitely short. It's all over in about two hours, and that includes several tries at the ""second chapter,"" which is really just kind of an arena challenge. In a traditional game, I'd consider this more like a ""vertical slice"" than a finished game, because it introduces a bunch of zelda-like tools (sword, shield, bow, pickaxe, hammer, etc.) but you don't get much use out of any of them. There are only seven kinds of enemies, one of them a boss and the other a miniboss. So it's short.

But for VR right now, this isn't a huge downside; there hasn't really been time to create long games, and the tech is so new that experiences like this feel a bit like a theme park ride. And if this [i]were[/i] a theme park ride, I'd be pretty tempted to pay another $20 to go and do it again. The graphical style and animations are quite polished, and the atmosphere is very well done. And it's hard to overstate how intimidating the giant skeletons in the game are when you first encounter them. By the end of the game, you'll have found exploits for their combat AI, which is pretty limited, but that's fine, because that's how RPGs always are--by the end, you're a seasoned warrior who has no trouble dispatching hordes of low-level enemies and even a boss or two. It's just that here, you're actually more skilled at defeating the enemies.

It's worth noting that my play area is slightly below the minimum requirements: mine is 1.8x2.5m. I was still able to play the game fine, although I did encounter the auto-pause feature a lot. The game pauses if you get too close to the edge of your play area while doing something active, so that you won't swing through your chaperone and break something. At that point it asks you to move back to the center of your play space (which is shown with a green circle and some arrows) and hit a button to unpause. This works pretty well, though it does break up the flow of the action a little. I still hit things through my chaperone a [i]little,[/i] but mostly when doing gentle things like reaching for a potion, so I didn't do any serious damage. A nice large space will give you the best experience with the game, but you can get away with just under the minimum.

All in all, probably my second-favorite title after The Gallery. Sorry, Space Pirate Trainer, you got bumped down a notch."
23461115,"The fact that such a cheezy, cartoonish looking monster almost made me poop the first time it came at me should be evidence enough that this is worth the money. Seriously, I have never felt so badass as when I killed that first skeleton. Like motherfuckin' Conan."
23458975,"My first VR game bigger than simple LAB or Tilt Brush. It has quite easy graphics but playable and enjoyable. I have read that it was made by one guy during several months. Nice job! So if it will be one of your first VR experiences, buy it. If you have already played several adventures / RPG in VR, then you can skip this."
23458466,Best VR vive game available so far!
23457720,"YES. this was Epic.

but 10 times too short... Would love to see more of this"
23455250,"A womderful game, a dream come true almost. This is a vision of future gaming. Ever since I was a kid I've always wanted a good D&D VR experience and this surpisingly more or less does the job in a cartoony D&D world. The feeling you get when you pick up the bow and arrow and start using it, the sword and shield battles are interesing ... (yes you can fight more than one at a time even making it itneresting). There's necromancers that heal the undead forcing you to tackle them first. A big undead monster that gets smart and starts using his shield to deflect arrows after you weaken him initially etc

 I wonder if they got inspired by ITVs UK show Knightmare from the 1990s... this is better than Knightmare though. I really like it, it's not simply a tech demo, it is the first steps to the future of gaming. Also here's a gaming tip ... use your sword LEFT handed for the undead !

This has the potential to superceed the likes of Skyrim... including more complex quests, NPCs, a magic system (although I aint got to that part yet strangely even though I see a mana counter, I've played sword and shield warrrior / archer). 

First time in a video game that I got vertigo also... I love it ... this is a 4.5/5 game."
23448896,Great first adventure RPG for the Vive.
23448004,游戏的效果非常棒，格斗场景很有沉浸感！关卡太少了啊，我一次性就过关了
23444603,"Awesome RPG for VR. You do need a decent amount of room to move around, but yea. I say it's worth the money."
23443348,"Highs:
- Melee combat in vr! It is really awesome to find out all melee possibilities and attack varations (of the enemies as well).
- magic spells in vr!
- atmosphere, sometimes i feel the cold from the castle walls

Improve:
- My friend didn't want to invest the time to get trough the turtorial and missed out. Radically making the tutorial more simple and fun (make weapons available) will help here
- the puzzels may be a tad more difficult, not too much since it will turn of non-gamers.

Bugs:
While dodging of arrows of enemies is excellent, i could just shoot them off from a safe distance without them trying to attack me.

Awesome game, really immersive."
23441108,"its just 100 mins content?
more charpter coming ?
"
23440072,"WOW! My best VR game yet! The game play is great! Nothing has felt as good as defeating those creatures! I just wish the game was finished! Oh well, patience I suppose!"
23439170,Great VR experience! A lot of fun.
23437930,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Absolutely my favourite game for VR so far. Incredibly immersive, made me feel like I was actually there. Fantastic interface and inventory system, amazing atmosphere, especially in chapter 1. I would happily have many more chapters to play with."
23434885,"太好玩了  就是很多地方要解密可惜没中文
"
23430981,Remember that first time you went to Disney as a smal child? Yeah its sort of like that but better.
23429331,"One of the first VR games I've played so far that was actually engaging and appealed to my need to play just 5 more minutes. It looks cartoonish in the store, but once you get in game it's pretty impressive. Combat get's harder, but your bag of tricks continues to expand. Changing weapons on the fly is pretty amazing. I feel like mouse clickers and hotbar RPGs might be spoiled for me now. Highly recommended."
23428037,"This is one of the best games I have ever played.
I hope they keep expanding on it."
23426651,"This is by far my favorite VR game so far!  Holy shit! You did a great job creating the environments with such basic unity assets, and making it feel real! I love it, its just like zelda!"
23423095,"Simply amazing, worth the cost twice over. Fighting opponents in old-school games could easily get boring, not so when there is a huge skeleton swinging various weaponry at you. Don't think, just buy it :)"
23423090,Its a very nice game ! Unfortunately its less then two hours playtime :-/
23422588,I really liked it. Would buy again.
23421577,没找到试玩的链接下载，直接就购买了。一点都不后悔，绝对是我装HTC VIVE以来最好玩的游戏。可以说是VR版本的赛尔达传说。不论是画面还是操作都是VR游戏中一流的。我一口气玩了2个多小时停不下来。强烈强烈推荐！！！
23418255,This game feels like a tour in a Disney land park. It's very well made with few if any bugs. Game play feels fluid and intuitive. Not too scary for kids too!
23413723,"This absolutely delivers on the promise of a VR dungeon crawler.  I searched for gold, I solved puzzles, I figured out the well-written riddles.  It is polished in every area, the combat is varied and intense, and I worked up a sweat in the boss battles.  Makes you think, makes you fight, makes you duck.  Love this game.  This is the showpiece I want for my friends who don't believe yet.  A must-buy for Vive."
23412557,Im Moment das beste spiel fuer die HTC Vive  leider mit 2 leveln etwas kurz
23412168,"开发团队 Indimo Labs 在设计《消失的国度》时，还是花费了许多心思。

从游戏背景到游戏交互，无一不体现了 Indimo Labs 的诚意。

传说级的游戏背景，将玩家带到一个充满奇幻色彩的世界。

宝石、金杯、金币等收集要素，大大提高了游戏本身的趣味性。

最好玩的部分还是游戏交互，两只手势控制器能够模拟出剑、盾和长弓，还有魔杖

这样多种武器的选择，让玩家变身无敌的战士，尽情地展现自己的战斗力。

然后，勇敢地与魔王的部队面对面战斗。

23410450,Finally! Chopping skellies in real 1p view!
23410349,"Quite honestly the most impressive VR game i've played so far on the Vive.  In terms of immersion its just like literally steppuing into the shoes of an adventurer from any classic D&D styled dungeon crawler from the early 90's - how far we've come!  ^^  

Thoroughly enjoyable - the only downside is it ends too soon!  1-2 hours is a likely first playthrough, and in truth theres not much to go back through for (apart from sheer enjoyment ofc) but damn i would happily have played on for another 10-20 hours!  :)  Testament to the game I guess.  Can't wait for chapters 3+"
23407428,One person made this game. That should make you feel small.
23406209,"Got my Vive this week and was kinda bummed when I found out that my GTX 690's in SLI were not enough to run VR properly (SLI in and of itself being a problem and since both cards are really 680's in SLI I thought I was doomed ... GTX 1080 on the way) but I have been slowly trying games out and since I've been having more success then failures I decided to give this a try, mainly due to the reviews being so glowing as I normally AVOID Early Access like the plague since I've been burned too many times.

I am beyond glad I did ... just the first 10 minutes of the game were utterly mind blowing.  The immersion of simply grabbing a torch off the wall and having the lighting change as you hold it over your head is just magical.  Having a 'duck and cover' bow fight with a skeleton is just silly ... LOL.  If you have a Vive this is an instant must buy

UPDATE - and almost a month later, trying just about every thing I can get my hands on and this game STILL is amazing in it's quality and the best game for the Vive IMHO ... MORE PLEASE!!!"
23405271,This was amazing! The first proper RPG for the HTC Vive and if you ever played WoW or anything similar and want to see what it could be like in VR - this is your go-to game :)
23401534,The best VR game i have ever played those far.

23392609,so good!! Love this game! be sure to have your A/C on cause it will give you a good little sweat. Lots of arm swinging! Such a great experience. Graphics are fun and emmersive. I noticed after a while. the AI could kinda learn what you will do next if you say keep hitting them with an arrow from far away. They will try to dodge or block it.
23391331,"Awesome game!  Woops, WTF?  I'm done?

It is a $20 demo.  I'm really annoyed because I LIKED the game, but it costs more than a movie, and lasted about as long.  Once it gets about 3x more content, I would completely recommend it.  Til then, not a chance."

23384508,"ゲーマーなら誰だって夢見たことがあるだろう、剣と魔法のRPGの世界に入り込んで主人公になる事を。
このゲームはその夢をViveを使って実現する一本である。

プレイヤーは剣、盾、弓矢、魔法の杖を駆使し、古代遺跡の謎を解き明かすのが目的。
2本のViveコントローラを利用し、盾で敵の攻撃を弾いたり、剣で攻撃を叩き落としたあと、剣で突きを入れる等、かなりリアルに近いチャンバラができる。
しかもこのゲームは立位や座位ではなく、ルームスケール専用である。
ルームスケールの範囲内であれば、敵の攻撃を本当に避け、回り込み、斬るという動作ができてしまう。
おかげで没入感は尋常ではなく、解像度以外はほぼ現実と言っても過言ではない。
最初に敵に襲われた時は、本当に死ぬかと思ったくらい迫力があった。

遠くに居る敵には弓矢、まとまった敵を一掃する際には魔法の杖が使える。
弓矢はちゃんと両手で弓を引く動作を取らなければならない。
敵にも遠距離攻撃を仕掛けてくる奴が居るので、物陰に隠れつつ、敵の攻撃が止んだら体を出して弓を撃つなんてこともできる。

そこそこの運動量があるので、リアルのプレイヤーが疲れてしまうこともある。
その際はそこら辺に寝転んで休憩しよう。綺麗な夜空が見える。
Viveを持っているなら絶対に購入すべき1本。

気になる部分としては、早期アクセスでまだチャプター2までしか実装されていないこと。
敵の種類が少ない事。2時間程度で終わり、特にチャプター2の手抜き感があること。
ルームスケールでそこそこの広さを確保しないと、リアルの壁を殴る可能性があること。
（参考までに、自分は倉庫に使ってた6畳の部屋を丸ごとVR部屋に変えてしまったが、それでも何回かPC置いてる机殴ってた）

23382285,One of the best and immersive VR games right now !
23382213,Great. can't wait for more.
23375502,Awesome VR experience. Clearly build by a small team on a limited budget but the experience is a great showcase for VR is going. Can't wait to see and plan more levels in the future!
23374957,"Great experience for the Vive.  I think my favorite part was the combat, especially the ability to actually parry the enemies blade and arrows.  Aside from occasionally clipping into the wall (in both the game and real life) I would say it was an overall positive experience."
23371321,"have to say this is one of the best VR games ive played so far. the only thing that sadens me is that there isnt more yet i really want more to the story line, like what the f*ck is the dragon egg for? but other than that i give it a 10/10 for gameplay but a 1/10 for making me wait for more."
23370532,I enjoyed the game a lot. The combat feels good and the art style is good. It is somewhat cartoony but it works well for this gen of VR and has worked on game meant for normal monitors. For a lot of the game I'd for get where I was in my room and easily wonder out of my play area. Wacked my wall good in this game more than once. The game is playable standing but you'd likely lose yourself and wack something you'd rather not. There are minor bug here and there but it is an early access game and they are not game breaking.
23367260,"Oh wow I waited until I was finished the game to write a review. What can I say? There is not enough to nit pick at to say the game is not worth buying for VR. It is a great VR RPG. It is rather short but what are we to expect for a newly full functioning VR system? Triple AAA? They take long to make and I am sure they are on the  horizon. Plus I am not sure games for VR are going to be better with 50, 100, 200 hours of gameplay unless they are multiplayer. You just can not be in VR for super long distances of time. Yes people I know you technically can but the way I see it most people do VR in spirts unless in MP. If you have VR and like RPGs then support this developer and encourage them to do more VR games especially devs that support room scale and motion controllers which boils down to actual VR Immersion. Buy this."
23363196,"Unique experience for the vive, and can be a work out to boot.  While the artistic style is simple it works, the skeleton warriors loom over  you, there is a great visceral feel from banging your sword off your shield before engaging in combat.  There are light puzzle elements also, which helps round out the dungeon crawler experience. 

So to keep this simple, would you like to play a dungeon crawler from first person, where your fighting skill was tied to literally how you moved and attacked in the real world? Like collecting loot and solving puzzles that are not too hard?

If so then give Vanishing Realms a try.

1 Caveat: This game thrives off of having a larger play space, you sense of freedom, ability to fight and avoid traps is directly relational to how much size you have mapped out in the real world, you'll want enough space to fully swing your arms in any direction and be able to take a step in any direction without coming up against a real life wall."
23361779,"Pese a que los graficos son estilo WoW, y que al parecer és cortito (después de 90 min. todavia estoy con él) el precio que tiene se lo vale al proporcionar un juego de Mazmorras de ""la vieja escuela"" sin muchas complicaciones (no te vas a encallar) pero que demuestra como la VR y las HTC Vive pueden proporcionar una experiéncia de juego sin paragón!

Inmersión total, con una habitación pequeña se puede jugar perfectamente, pero estoy seguro que en una un poco mas grande los combates se tienen que trannsformar en todo un festival.

Tan solo espero que otros Dev tonem nota y la oferta de juegos para nuestras Vive empieze a estar a la altura, como esta pequeña joya.

--- Post finalizado ---

Efectivamente el juego es muy corto, con menos de dos horas lo he completado enterito y sin muchos dolores de cabeza.

Después de mucho darle a la cabeza, pedí un refound ya que creia que un juego que te dura menos de dos horas no se merece lo que pagué por él.  Aun así lo he vuelto a comprar para mis hijas, ya que creo que a dia de hoy és el mejor juego para Vive con diferéncia... y he vuelto a empezar la partida, tan solo para poder disfrutar de nuevo de cada sala y del ambiente de immersión que desprende por todos lados."
23354086,I really had fun with this game. Looking forward to more chapters.
23354074,Fantastic game! I only wish I could figure out how to replay chapters without starting a whole new game - but I have because I enjoy it so much! Can't wait for more chapters!
23353628,"Wow!  I've only played an hour or so, but damn!  If this is what people can come up with so early in VR's life the future is amazing.

It might not look it, but this game is creepy.  Even with the cartoon graphics (which are very nice but don't look scary) I was genuinely worried I'm run into a baddy.  Clearly being in VR automatically makes physical confrontations scaries (I found the same in Buget Cuts), but the game's atmosphere is very well designed.

So far the gameplay has been fun too, will update after I've played more, if I remember.

This game is top of my list of things to show off VR to people who haven't tried it."
23352244,"This game took me about 3 hours to complete and provided a satisfying ending. I actually really like the combat style of this and it grew on me the more I played the game. The ability to make good lunge attacks to get around shields and armor really adds to the immersion. 

The graphics feel like LoL, low poly and very much like a painting."
23351615,So far the best VR game I have played.  I was sad when it was over.  IT was shorter than I expected based on the developers time table.  Even with that its still the best time I have had in VR.  I want more.
23345927,"I love the game, so much fun.... now I just need more content"

The combat system could be improved a bit.  I feel like most of my swings weren't actually connecting with the monsters. but its really close.  I definitely am a fan of the auto-pausing when you get too close to a wall.  It saved me from smacking my walls more than once.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]The atmosphere and polish is off the charts. You really feel like you're there.
[*]Graphics and lighting effects look great.
[*]GUI and inventory managment is relatively fluid.
[*]Different weapons and equipment keeps the game interesting as you progress.
[*]Auto pause when you are about to hit bounds is a life-saver. (You can also turn it off if it annoys you.)
[*]Probably the most immersed I've been in VR so far. A must-have in my opinion.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]If you're not in atleast a 3m by 3m area you're going to be triggering bounds a lot. You can definetly play in a smaller area, but you're going to be teleporting a lot. Which might kill immersion for some people. Game is best enjoyed in a huge area (5m x 5m), where you can really immerse yourself. Walking around and fighting enemies like you mean it.
[*]2 hours just doesn't feel like enough once you finish it. That being said it is on par or better than most VR titles in the cost/playtime department.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Enemy AI is pretty dumb. Even in boss fights, you can just teleport right next to a boss and bash their face in. They won't be able to hit you. Unless you're in melee 3v1 you won't really be challenged.
[*]Not much story to speak of. Usually lore is dropped through in-game scrolls and books, but there isn't much of an attempt at a coherent storyline. Especially in the second half of the episode, where you pop from place to place, even doing a gladitorial arena, with little to no explanation.
[*]Additional graphics options, and optional higher res textures would be welcome.

かつてない面白さを体験した。Viveを持ってるなら必携の一本。"
23305115,"This is one of the best games out there for the Vive. I don't usually review games, but if you bought a Vive, you need to buy this as well. It's amazing, immersive, and fun."
23302584,"The best thing by [i]far[/i] on SteamVR right now. Ignore the ""early access"" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.

What makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: Wield your controller as a sword! Parry attacks! Lunge! Chop! Once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! Use a bow and arrow (like in The Lab)! Switch between them! Yay!

Some ""early access"" things do come up. They are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: Combat is too easy once you understand it. The enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don't know how to move around intelligently. I think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other VR games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. Finally, 2 hours is not enough! By the time I got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! It would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.

But these seem like nitpicks. All in all Vanishing Realms is a wonderful place from which to see the promising VR RPG future.

If only for labeling this ""early access"" Indimo Labs deserves a lot of credit. 90% of the ""full"" releases on SteamVR right now are buggy, incomplete, half-baked experiments. It's deceitful to sell them at any price. But Indimo knows that the fact that VR is new doesn't mean people shouldn't get a complete, working, tested game, and is willing to risk lower sales by using the truthful ""early access"" label. Bravo!"
23299174,"This was an incredible experience. It is exactly what I was hoping to get out of the Vive. I can only hope more games like this get created.

As with most Vive games, the videos and screenshots just do not do this justice. 

The movement system was done extremely well, and the archery combat was my favorite. Hand to hand fighting the larger skeletons with bigger shields was a bit of a pain, but overall very exciting. The boss battles were able to be cheesed a little, without much thinking, but it didn't really take a whole lot away from the experience. 

Really hope this sets a tone for additional Vive titles to come."
23284798,"This will be my first review on Steam. Hell, it'll be my first review anywhere. 

There's not much I can say that hasn't been, but I'll try anyway since I think devs need to see that their efforts are worthwhile and makeing a huge difference.

I remember playing Legend of Zelda on NES as a kid.  I loved it so much I asked to go to the hardware store, bought a plank of wood, and went at trying to create my own shield. Epic fail, since my artistic and handicraft skills are subpar - at best. But it was the first spark of a decades long, insatiable quest to transport myself to another world and do the things that weren't possible. 

It's been a long time since then, but for the first time ever, I feel like I've come close. This game is the promising first step in that journey. For those of us who have gotten Vive or are contemplating getting it, it's going to be a rough ride until something with Skyrim/Zelda production value comes out. But if you've even the slightest inclination to really feel like you're the hero in the game, this is the closest you can get at this time.

PRO's: 
- Everything you could extrapolate from my introductory statements. You *are* the hero in this game. It's f-in' great. 
- Excellent swordplay mechanics (some prefer Spell Fighter VR - which is great - but I think the dodge/block/parry mechanics are better here). 
- Engaging atmosphere despite the sourced assets (ie: the character models were bought from a store).
- Solid music. 
- Intuitive puzzles.
- Leaves you aching for more content. 

CONS:
- An argument can be made that it is a short experience. However, none of us early adopters should go into *any* game thinking we're going to experience the next Skyrim/Dishonored/etc...
- While I think the utility belt inventory system is very interesting, I have to hyperextend my head downwards to see it. It also moves around erratically when I'm kneeling down. 
- I'd love it if there was more depth to the magic system (currently it's item-based magic limited to one item at this time). Not hoping for a miracle here, but it would've been nice to play as a wizard rather than a sword fighter every time. 
- No Hard Mode. While enemy difficulty does increase slightly, they are far outpaced in damage after gaining the last sword. They also become easier in general by the time you have a second playthrough. Hard Mode needs to happen. 
- Trackpad locomotion for both movement and turning would be superior for those of us with 'vr legs'. I like teleporting sometimes, but in battle I'd rather just reorient myself with the trackpad. It feels like cheating to just teleport away.

Anyway, I hope this inspires other devs to keep the ball rolling and iterate on RPG/Adventure games. And to the dev of this game in particular, please keep up the good work. There's not many who've gambled on anything resembling an RPG at this stage in the VR launch cycle, and you're currently leading the pack by a wide margin. Keep it up."
23284753,沉浸感非常强，希望继续开发，有成为大作的潜力。另外，希望开发中文版，毕竟剧情是很重要的一部分
23281411,"Pros:
+ Nice art style, cartoony but fun.
+ Lots of treasure to find in nooks and crannies, makes exploration fun.
+ Pretty good melee combat mechanics: swing your weapon past an enemies shild and helmet, block their attacks, sometimes they feint, so you have to pay attention and be ready to block from a different angle.

Cons:
- Short, there is only about 2 hours of content here, and little replay value.  The last part of the game (spoiler alert) is just repeated arena fights, perhaps added to pad out the length of the game so people will be less likely to get refunds.
- Dull movement, besides room scale you can only teleport, and because it does not show you where your playspace will be in your prospective destination (like The Lab does), it makes movement frustrating.
- Poor AI, understandable for an early VR game, but the enemies keep backing away, which means I have to keep teleporting close to them because my play space is only 2.5x2.5 meters, but the game sometimes prevents you from teleporting directly next to an enemy.  All in all it feels like enemy movement is working against the melee mechanics.
- Bow is not fun.  It aims wherever your primary hand is pointing it, secondary hand is just used to pull back the arrow, making it feel unrealistic.
- Lack of story, there are just a few cryptic messages guiding you around.  The game has little atmosphere and almost no personality.
- Bad UI, you have to look down to check yout health, mana, gold, and inventory.  This combined with the small sweet spot on the Vive's lenses, makes it difficult to focus on the text.  Maybe it is better for people without glasses, I don't know.
- Abandonware?  The game has passed the time frame layed out in the early access description, with no updates in two months.  The game was described as having almost two hours of content per chapter, but I was able to easily clear both chapters in under two hours, as the second chapter is just a series of arena fights.

I really wanted to like this game based on it's reviews, but I found the gameplay to not be very fun, and it was only challenging when it was frustrating, such as fights against groups of enemies when you can't tell who is hitting you from where.  I was surprised at how soulless the game felt, I never felt there was a good reason for anything I was doing, just dungeon crawling for the sake of it, which once you get past the glitter of ""it's in VR!"" becomes boring fast.

I will be eager to check out this game again once it has more updates and re-review it then, but as of now, I wish I had not bought it."
23277945,"Best vive game out at the moment, buy it!"
23273272,"I really had a great time in this game. While some of the mechanics could use a little more refinement, the total experience is wonderful, and really gives you a good look at what large scale games for VR will eventually be like. There are some really nice level design moments, such as the room with the archer you can't reach right away, which feel really new in VR. Some suggestions:

- Magnet on object pickup, especially on gold/coins
- Limited, but recoverable, ammo for the bow. It's too exploitable right now.
- All small objects should be interactable. Because so many of them are not, I got confused in the begining and didn't realize I could pick up the torches. Consistency of object interaction seems more important in VR than in regular games.
- A bit more hand holding in the first rooms.  
- Current mechanics for grab/let go are a little confusing as they are slightly different than many games (most likely because you want the sword/etc to equipt without having to keep the trigger pressed) - but I often ended up dropping items by mistake, and eventually lost my pick axe this way.
- More hidden goals, secrets, etc for replayability. 

Overall though this is one of my favorite games for early VR, and I can't wait for more."
23272549,"Best thing on the Vive so far, and I have tried pretty much everything.
Although I am stuck in the place where you get the Bow and have to kill the archers..can't find the way forward :-)
But that does not take anything away from this terrific work of a game. 10/10"
23270085,"Very enjoyable and fighting life sized skeletons is mind blowing. Needs to be longer and while there are more episodes coming. Another couple of hours in this one would not have hurt. Sword play could be improved and teleporting is a little touchy and not as good as in other games that use teleporting movement. 

But clashing your sword on your shield in a come get me motion is pure fun. Looking up and seeing fantasy structures and scenery is what I have dreamed off since I first played a fantasy game on a flat screen. 

Overall this is a must have game for the vive right now, better games in the genre will eventually come along. But right now this hints at what fantasy games can be in VR."
23268120,"Awesome fun, this is my favorite VR game so far. Its pretty engaging and its easy to get invested. The only downside is that at the moment it is quite short. About two hours but it is way better than spending that money going to a movie."
23265599,"I've put some time into it for now and even before I'm really ""digging"" into the game, the depth and feel to it is very nice for an Early Access game. I'm looking forward to additional content released in the future, and am glad to support the devs in this. Probably my favorite of the VR games I've played on my Vive so far."

23262864,"Terrific game, hardly feels like early access. The experience is very immersive, combat is very satisfying, albeit a tad on the easy side. Overall, a great game. The one thing I've heard is that the teleport mechanic gives some people headaches, but I myself have never experienced this."
23261734,"I've had my Vive 3 days. I have played The Lab, Job Sim, Budget Cuts, Elite, etc. This is BY FAR the most amazing experience yet.  The bow shooting, blocking/sword fighting, actually mining with a pick, etc make it so immersive!  This is the best value in VR!"
23259417,"This game is incredibly immersive. You'll have to crawl under swinging blades, block sword swings with your shield, and swing your sword to fight monsters."
23258096,"Yes! This is exactly how I want my VR games to be! I was skeptical at first but before long I was completely engrossed in this world. 
-Teleporting works great once you get used to it. It nicely avoids motion sickness while actually speeding up gameplay.
-Combat is phenomenal. I'm so glad they put the time into getting this right! It feels satisfying. 

One of my favorite VR games so far, and I've played a bunch. The next title in this series is an instant buy for me-- I can't wait for more!"

Even using ""blink"" for movement, it feels good and is quite immersive. I was sitting on this game in my inventory for awhile before playing and now I can't get enough. Dodging arrows, using a shield has never felt more natural in a game. 

Just one suggestion, use a different sound when picking up coins, sounds like the goofy sound used in Sonic, when he gets coins. Kinda takes away from experience.

Vanishing Realms has easily become my daily playgame, and my D&D fix.. 

Thx, Dev's"
23239260,"imho the best HTC VIVE game atm !
pls take my money and work on an add on  ;)"
23224765,"I just bought this game because of all of the positive reviews, and boy does it not disappoint!!!

I thought I'd take a quick look and 80 minutes just passed in the blink of an eye.

This game is awesome in every way. This is exactly what VR vive games should be like.

this gets me so excited for future games, it shows what 'real' games will be like in the near future.. and perhaps even much much better.

Get this!!"
23219026,"This is a good game, but not really worth the $20 price tag for how short it is, and more so for how there is practically no replay value as it is right now. Maybe I am spoiled by games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, where after 120 hours of gameplay, I am not even close to done playing? And I picked that up for $30. Here, I am paying $20 for two hours of entertainment, so it doesn't quite add up no matter how good it is.

With that aside, what you do get to experience in those 2 hours is quite good. It is definitely cool to fight the skeletons, especially when dual wielding two swords, even though the fights are a little slow and clunky with so-so collision detection. I can see this maybe becoming a little more worth the price if a few bonus or side quests are added, along with a separately selected arena with leader boards. In a game that already has a bow and arrow, swords, a shield, and a magic wand, the possibilities for mini-games are endless.

Add that extra content, and I would fully recommend this game as a worthwhile $20 investment, but as it is now, I feel a bit slighted, and would not have paid more than $8-$10. It is also interesting to note that since the game takes just over 2 hours to complete, it takes you just past the 2 hour game time limit for returns, and then ends - that seems like a little more than a coincidence to me, but it is mentioned in the description, so it's not like it's a shock when it ends and you are left upset that there isn't more. But that right there is the important part - I was left wanting more. 

I didn't give this game a thumbs down because it is a bad game, I gave it a thumbs down because it is currently rather over-priced. I hope that will change as development continues, and if it does, I will try to remember to update my review/recommendation.

UPDATE: Rather disappointed that after 4 months, there is still not a single update to this game. I stand by my review that this had the potential to be one of the greatest VR experiences out there, but instead the developer seems to have taken our money and disappeared. Such is the risk of investing in a game in the hopes that the money will go to improving it.

I also do not think it is a coincidence that every single negative review for this game is being downvoted to make them disappear from the ""most helpful reviews."" Go ahead and filter to see for yourself."
23213374,"Vanishing Realms is very engrossing and immersive, and while the gameplay isn't really balanced at all and there's a ton of missing features, I'll give it a weak recommendation because it's still one of the strongest VR titles available right now.

Good first:
*Environments are large, well-crafted, and immersive
*Sound design is good, although 3D positional audio is weak
*Gameplay has some good core mechanics 
*By far the best handling of ""out of bounds""; every other VR game lets you walk through walls and stick your head in solid objects, but Vanishing Realms fades out your view if you stick your head in an object and teleports you backward if you try to walk in a wall. Every game should work like this.

The bad:
(I like to complain so this is much larger than the ""Good"" section, but shouldn't be considered to outweigh the good)
*Gameplay isn't balanced. There isn't enough variety between the weapons - the two bows both do 5 damage, the medium sword and the hammer both do 6 damage, the hammer doesn't work any differently than the sword. Enemies have an aggro range of about 3 feet and you can skip entire battles by standing out of aggro range and blasting away with your ranged weapons. When you're actually in melee range, the enemies crowd you too much; one of those skeleton soldiers fills up your entire screen and makes you constantly want to back up.
*Combat is too simple when you're fighting only one enemy but completely overwhelming and unmanageable when you're fighting 3 enemies, partially because the enemies are so bulky you can only watch one at a time
*Not enough enemy attack animations. The skeleton soldier is the main enemy you encounter and only has two or three animations. After you get used to the timing of its main attack, you get a brief period of feeling badass and then combat starts to go stale.
*There are no consequences for death. You respawn 10 feet away with your inventory intact and the enemies still wounded. This is probably because the gameplay isn't balanced.
*Store assets - the same skeleton soldier also appears in Legend of Luca, which must mean it was bought from the Unity asset store or a third-party asset store. Not inherently bad, but gamers can grow sick of models if they start popping up in multiple games
*Inventory system is buggy, clunky, and impossible to use in combat. Once a fight starts, the only way you can switch weapons is to teleport far away from the fight, which feels like cheating
*Only 2 - 3 hours of gameplay depending on how much you rush and how much you get lost
*Save system is minimalistic - it saves your inventory and your position but not your progress. Enemies and obstacles respawn if you quit the game and load up your save again
*No way to return to the menu without quitting the game. C'mon, this isn't the NES era...
*The developer isn't active on the forum, which is bad form for an EA game. If you don't have a dialog with your customers, you're defeating the entire point of EA"
23213264,"This game is a blast to play. It's a bit short on content so hopefully we'll see some more interesting levels and mechanics in the near future. 
Also just be wary of nearby cameras otherwise your friends will make you e-famous recording you in your headsets swinging your wizard junk around."
23211207,"WOW, like the other positive reviews stated, THIS is the game I dreamed about as a kid.  Walking up to a 7-foot skelton and waiting for the perfect time to parry his attack and slay him with vivid in-game immersion and 1:1 controls.   It's not the perfect game , but the best taste of what room scale VR on the Vive is capable of. 

If Dark Souls and Zelda had a pocket-sized holo baby, this is it.   I'm looking forward to seeing these concepts even more fleshed out in VR

"
23207210,"The good:
It's amazing to walk thru a RPG dungeon  and slaying monsters with a sword while really dodging their attacks. It's a fun game with (well, were talking about VR here) nice graphics and some interesting ideas.
The bad: 
It clearly shows that teleporting (which works well in the lab for example) coulndt be the last word for locomotion in VR. Movin long distances is teleport-teleport-teleport-teleport-teleport-teleport and so on. For me it breaks the immersion and the presence. This kind of movement is also to easy to exploit against mobs. 

But overall its a good VR game and a step in the right direction. A little bit expensive maybe. But we've all paid more for less content in this new VR aera, I guess."
23205401,"Great game, if a little short.  The creatures are nice and querky.  A good combination of smashing things, searching and killing things.  The puzzles (if you can call them that) are simple, just look around somewhere near the door and you will find the key type of thing (although waving the torch around to give extra light often helps)."
23204471,"Just one word: AMAZING.

Eagerly waiting for more content."
23203743,"It is a real pleasure to play this game. Everything I like ;-)

Enigma, moving fights and nice environment. I definitively recommend as a good VR experience."
23203407,"Love it. One of my favorite gaming experiences -ever- occured simply by loading into the first temple scene and being blown away by the feeling of presence and the exhilaration of being fully immersed into VR. And then I found a sword :)

One of the first buys I made when I received my Vive...and probably my favorite experience thus far. I cant believe this is an Early Release title, too! Cant wait to see what else comes in future updates. Beautiful game."
23202833,"Throughout the gameplay, I find myself repeating very profound and eloquent phrases like ""Very awesome!"", ""Oh Wow!"" and even ""Coooool!"". The game has a very a consistent and polished look with really smooth and intuitive gameplay. I love that I can use my sheild to block a sword or arrow strike coming from one direction while I attack in another. I was surprised to have infinite arrows and durablility, but I like that too. The arena type waves get a little intense, I managed to fall onto my couch which my wife was sitting on at the time and then I smacked my cat in the face with the conroller (they are both ok :) Stop reading this and go play this game!"
23202030,"Vanishing Realms ist das erste ""richtige"" Spiel das ich auf der HTC Vive gespielt habe und man nicht als Demo bezeichnen kann. Und ich muss sagen, es hat mich wirklich sehr unterhalten! 

Gameplay:
Vanishing Realms funktionert einwandfrei in VR. Die Bewegungen werden fast immer perfekt ins Spiel übertragen und es ist einfach beeindruckend, wie man mit Schild und Schwert gegen virtuelle gegner antreten kann. Hierbei ist allerdings zu beachten, dass man ausreichend Platz im Zimmer hat. Meine Spielfläche ist ca. 2 x 1,5 meter groß und es kam mehr als einmal vor, dass ich den Controller gegen die Wand geschmettert habe. Neben Schwert und Schild gibt es unter anderem noch zwei Bogen, die für abwechslung sorgen.
Sehr positiv zu bewerten sind auch Dinge wie das abbauen von Erzen wie Gold und Diamand, sowie die Suche nach anderen ""Schätzen"". Es gibt auch ein kleines Gesundheitssystem, wobei man Tränke, Äpfel oder Orangen essen kann um sich zu erholen.

Story:
Hier gibt es eher wenig zu berichten. Eine wirkliche Geschichte wird einem nicht erzählt. Es gibt lediglich ein paar ""Schriftrollen"" zu studieren die zumeist Hinweise zum lösen eines Rätsels sind. 
Das Spiel baut eher auf dem Erkunderdrang und der VR Erfahrung, als auf einer Geschichte auf.

Grafik:
Die Grafik von Vanishing Realms ist natürlich weit entfernt von neuesten nicht VR Titeln, jedoch mit der Vive definitiv schön anzusehen. Es ist nicht nur einmal passiert, dass ich mir eine kurze auszeit vom Spielen nahm, um mir die Umgebung genauer anzusehen und der typische ""VR wow Effekt"" war selbst in einem Grafisch eher schlichten Titel wie diesem da. Alles ist sehr übersichtlich gestaltet, was der geringen Auflösung des VR headsets zu gute kommt. 
Als ich das erste mal vor einem der Skelett Gegner stand, hatte ich doch schon ziemlich schiss. Ich weiss das sich das lustig anhört, aber wer selbst mal die Erfahrung macht wird sehen was ich meine ;)

Fazit:
Vanishing Realms hat mich ohne Zweifel sehr gut Unterhalten und gezeigt, was zukünftige VR Spiele alles nutzen, bzw. besser machen können. Das einzige was mich zum Schluss dann doch gestört hat, war die Länge des Spiels. Ich hatte das Spiel in etwas mehr als 2 Stunden durchgespielt. Für 20€ hätte ich da schon etwas mehr erwartet. Allerdings kann ich das Spiel trotzdem weiterempfehlen, da es eben eines der bislang besten und einzigen Spielen für die HTC Vive ist.
"
23200816,戰鬥很有感覺
23200567,"Ein super Abenteuer. Wenn Ihr für die Vive ein tolles Game sucht, bitte kaufen. Ist echt zu empfehlen"
23195813,"Just, wow.  I havent had this much fun playing a video game in years.  Have a  bruise on my leg from dodging a virtual arrow into a real chair.  Gonna be sore in the morning.

10/10 Would bruise myself again.

For the record, I bought the Vive for myself for my 46th birthday."
23194336,"It's a little short, but one of the best experiences in VR right now. I really like the battle system. Hell you can catch arrows with your shield if you are good enough not to get hit! Also I hope future games use the way it has your stats and items right below, so you just have to look down to swap weapons or look at your health/mana"
23193195,"This... this is such an incredibly fun game!  The first moment you get your sword and swish it around then hold it up to admire the detail is unforgettable.  Now you just have to ask yourself... is it a sword and shield you want?  Perhaps two swords? Decisions... decisions... :)

Warning! I got a little bit too involved in the action and tossed my headphones across the room while demonstrating my exquisite swordplay.  Secure your gear!

Is it worth the price right now? Yes, support these guys so they make more chapters!"
23184217,"This is the game I've been waiting for since I played my first RPG in the 80s. You get to be the character in virtual space with realistic-ish weapon use, blocking, moving, and dodging. I only wish it were much much longer with a larger variety of areas and enemies, more story, and the availability of armor upgrades.

The immersion is wonderful, though I find myself wishing I had a warehouse sized VR area as my 3x3 meter space has me running into real world walls frequently during battles with multiple enemies. That and of course getting tangled up in the headset cord every few minutes. Nothing to do about that until someone can make a high powered, low latency wireless VR headset, which is likely another 5 or more years away."
23175405,"This is by far the best VR experience I have had yet. The trailer doesn't do it justice. It's very immersive, very entertaining, and has the ocasional moonlit vista to take your breath away. Yes, the AI could be better (monsters patiently wait until you get close enough to attack), but it's still great fun! Definitely a must-have addition to your VR library."
23174246,"I love this game. This is exactly the type of thing I was hoping for when it was announced a few years ago that VR was coming to the mass market. It isn't perfect, but it does a number of things very well.

First, the cons. 

What I didn't see in the description of the game is that it ""highly recommends"" a 2.0 x 2.0 meter space. I live in a small apartment, and my play space is only 2.0x1.6 meter. I can still play the game, but I have to be very careful because any time I stick my sword arm through the ""wall"" (my restricted space is couches, so I can reach well above them, I just can't walk into them) the game pauses, forces me to re-center in the space, and then unpause. Slightly annoying, but better than constantly walking into things. 

However, within about 30 minutes I learned how to not over-extend, but as a 6'0"" guy who has done steel sabre fencing and sword & board fighting in the SCA, it was hard to not try to execute lunges and molinets (wrist turns to get around an opponent's shield and hit them in the face) in that ""forbidden zone"". Treating it more like a video game and less like a fighting simulation did the trick.

The story is a little on the flimsy side. Don't expect anything too deep, you pretty much can get the gist of it from watching the intro video on the Steam page. It's not horrible or bad, it's just basic fantasy tropes.

The pros: 

The graphics are beautiful. To me, titles like this prove that we don't need photo-realism to be immersive in VR, especially when the game runs smoothly. 

Fighting monsters that are taller than I am is a lot of fun. I've always been a fan of games where projectiles persist in the environment, and fighting with an arrow sticking out of your shoulder is surprisingly satisfying. I mentioned the sword and shield mechanic struggles I had above, but it's still a lot of fun to use that weapon combo. The bow and arrow mechanics work fantastically and are a lot of fun, and you can't beat the destructive power of the magic wand.

Objects are easy to interact with and add a lot to the feel. The inventory system is pretty top-notch and intuitive: in need of a little health? Grab that apple out of the pocket you stuck it in and ""eat"" it by holding it up to your mouth. Did you find a key? Go find the lock that it goes to. 

Most of the text is super easy to read. Sometimes I struggle to see the health/mana meters because you have to look at your feet to see them, but the fact that they're out of the way when you're fighting is nice, and you can usually tell by the amount of blood you're looking through how your health is doing. :)

Overall, highly recommended. Don't let the minor flaws get in the way of a good time. If you're the type of person that enjoys adventure RPGs like Legend of Zelda or Fable, you'll probably love Vanishing Realms."
23174019,So after 2 years of nothing new. I feel it's safe to say the creator has taken the money and run.
23163357,"I have both the Vive and the Rift and have played a multitude of VR games on both. After I played the two available chapters in Vanishing Realms, it became my favorite VR experience so far. The scale of the first chapter is great and going around the cave and then the open world was great. 

What I really liked about Vanishing Realms was the combat and the way in which the inventory/UI is handled. The combat is crazy satisfying as you go against enemies looking for their attacks to block/parry but then you're also looking for their opennings that you can then strike. Every fight and every kill I got felt satisfying and deserved. 

As for the UI and inventory system, it is really simple and gets the job done. The UI is mostly minamalistic in that when you are looking out normally, you see no UI blocking your view. Everything UI is down below at your waist. When of your stats change (health, mana, or gold) they do pop up into your view but slowly lower back down to your waist. This system is perfect. Then for the gear and weapons you have, there's two 'backpacks', on on the left and right. This allows you to put things like keys, torches, food, potions, etc... in the backpack of the hand you will likely use. Torches and keys I would use in the left, but food and potions which I would need fast in combat were placed in my right pack so that my dominant hand could easily and quickly get to them. Between to two packs are your weapons devided into categories of one-handed melee, ranged-bow, and ranged-wand, and also the shield spot. Getting into fights and having to alternate between the weapons and gear was really simple and I never struggled to fight the way I wanted to in any engagement.

If you own a Vive, you need to play this first-person, Zelda style game.

5/5"
23163202,"Un peu cher pour son contenu actuel, mais ça reste l'un des jeux les plus immersif en VR d moment.
Le jeux ne brille pas forcément par sa réalisation technique, des bugs sont là et certaines mécaniques mériteraient à être peaufinée (mais n'oublions pas qu'il s'agit d'un jeu en accès anticipé et donc en cours de développement), mais clairement, par moment, on à vraiment l'impression d'être dans ce chateau perdu sur une ile.
Un grand espace est néanmoins requis pour ne pas heurté trop trouvent les bords de l'air de jeux, ce qui casse l'immersion (je conseillerais 2,5m x 2,5m minimum).

Impatient que la suite sorte, et que l'ergonomie soit amérliorée"
23158298,"Great ""mini"" RPG with Zelda elements with some fun exploration thrown in. I wish they would use the same parabolic teleport as The Lab uses, but this is still a great way to get around the world."
23156667,At first looks a little childish with the skeletons that u fight but after playing for a while the fighting is really fun only complaint is how short the game. Finished I'm 1 an half hours
23156147,deff one of my top 5 best vr games.
23155221,Great game cant wait for the next chapter
23152682,制作的还不错，但缺点是要用手柄跳跃移动，很影响融入感！
23149301,"This was the first experience I got completely lost in. Very cool, immersive and well done. For some reason my entire experience felt slightly tiled by a few degrees. The only gripe I had was the enemy AI being quite poor. You could essentially just crouch very close to any enemy with your shield up then take your sword and get it under their shield, just swinging it around for insta-kill... Kind of a cheap exploit. I think VR AI has to be a lot better than traditional AI, especially for Melee combat. Once I was finished, I was confused why I could no longer teleport in the real world :0"
23147926,First game I played on my VIVE. Played for 90 mins straight !! Definitely recommend

23142720,"Feels like you're playing an episode of Knightmare except you can see. Can't wait for chapter 3 and beyond. This is the kind of game I bought the Vive for, a truly immersive experience, especially when you realise can smash your sword against your shield and proceed to do so before every big fight. Brilliant."
23141540,"+ First encounter with skeleton warrior is scary
+ Atmosphere is spot on
+ Teleport movement works well
- UI / SFX feels like a cheap iOS game
- Sword combat isn't enjoyable
- Bow combat isn't as good as The Lab
- Music quickly gets reptitive
- Want movement options like ""Dash"" instead of Teleport
- Hard time limit on boss battle

The first hour of the game is very memorable. Standing face to face with a skeleton is shocking. Wandering around dark dungeons gives a distinct feeling, like you stepped inside a Zelda game. It's worth trying out because it's unique, literally can't get this anywhere else. However, there are many design decisions I don't like. The inventory system is barbaric, getting a particular item is always frustrating. The UI bounces up / down to always stay visible even if you don't want to look at it. Grabbing loot is followed by an annoying chime and stupid UI circles right in your face. The game tries really hard to remind you it's just a game, rather then just letting you be in the world. The final combat sequence is a series of enemies that must be defeated inside a short time limit. This is a bad decision, it encourages you to break the already flaky combat system, Actually  blocking swords and striking when you have an oportunity will cause you to fail since it's so time consuming.

Another developer will probably do this better relatively soon."
23141536,"Battles are engaging and the game mechanics are smooth. A good amount of weapons to choose from. Even though this game is short, it shows how VR RPG cames can be designed to be fun and immersive. I love to see more development of this game, it's definitely one for the better VR game out there right now."
23139445,"A great example of things to come. This may be an unpolished very short game but take your time with it and let yourself be immersed. Was left wanting more but need more room space then the bare minimum, hit my cupboard a bunch of times cause I was often forced to try swing my sword outside my play area. PS. Double welding is awesome!"
23138897,"10/10 Loved the game, I hope to see more mechanics where you duck to avoid being hit like from the big skeletal ogre that swings his flail. The wand is super over powered so I never used it and I think the game was a lot more enjoyable for that reason. I would love to play through it again with a hard mode unless I am a noob and didn't see a difficulty option in the menu"

i think im almost through the game and i played it for 4 hours?
So its short, compared to other games, but one of the longer VR games/demos out there.

23133868,"It really makes you feel like you are in a dungeon, slowly exploring it and I found that very enjoyable.
The game incites this sense of wonder, like you are really there. Makes it very easy to forget about your living room.
Also fighting a skeleton with a sword or deflecting arrows with your sword really gets your adrenaline pumping!"
23133070,"Note : Although this is mentionned the game require room scale, I play ""standing only"" perfectly fine. You can give it a try. /Note

After much debate i'm leaning toward a 'No'.

This game is a wonderfull experience. It truly embodies the incredible potential of vive VR. ACTUALLY hiding behind a tree to shoot an enemy with your bow is beyond cool, and so is wielding your sword at it.

But it is also extremelly ugly. Like last decade ugly. It's subjective but the 'cartoon' design is a complete failure for me. As much as i like wandering in a virtual word, I hate that it must look like it's been designed for a 9 year old.
Please keep in mind that the vive's total resolution is less than that of a WQHD screen which is becoming the standard for gaming. There is no reason for a 2016 game to be so ugly.

Also if you were to play it on a flat screen, you wouldn't even look twice at the game. It's a very ordinary dungeon crawler with nothing much to it (disclaimer : i'm not done with the game yet, i may still have a pleasant surprise).

Combine all this with the price tag for 2h worth of gaming, and you get a clear 'No' from me. 

The only real reason you want to buy it is to funnel money toward VR, and have people create ACTUAL games for the plateforms. Any real 2016 game made for the Vive would have blown my mind. This thing, not so much."
23131681,"I was giggling and laughing the whole time and didn't set it down until I finished it... the graphics suck but it didn't even matter. The monsters are gimmicky, the layout is basic, combat is basic...and my feet are as sore as the walls are bruised.

He also liked Batman v Superman, so he's not exactly the clock I'd set my watch to. It was only 20 bucks, and I figured it'd be worth a try. DUDE, like just DUDE. This game is sick!!!! It clocks in at only like 2 hours with exploration factored in, but I'd pay much more for this. The developer is working on more levels, and this purchase guarantees that you'll get them for free. None of that microtransaction crap. If you like Zelda, just get this game."
23126449,This game was great I am a goblin
23125260,"I have just started playing through Vanishing Realms for the second time, this time I am recording my adventure and thoughts as I go along https://youtu.be/hL1XfwmHstE

It is kind of true that the game is short, and I am still sort of confused as to how future content is going to be pushed through (ie as free updates or as new paid for episodes). However, since VR is new and has limited users its completely understandable why games such as this, which have a cost associated with them only last two to three hours. The developers have to price their games in a way that will bring them a return when sales will be lower than the general PC market. Got it.

That said, the couple of hourse of gameplay that are available with Vanishing Realms are a heck of a lot of fun. I often felt like I was playing the role Indiana Jones and the environments are absoluetly stunning in VR.

However, it is the room scale that really pushes the bar high. Being able to stroll around your own little space, lighting torches, peering over edges and looking through windows provides a gaming experience that I have simply never come close to having before. That isn't to say it is the best gaming I have ever had, it isn't; but it is so radically different to everything I have done before that comparing Vanishing Realms to any stadard monitor driven game would be like comparing apples and oranges. 

So, Vanishing Realms is short but awesomely entertaining.

The combat is also very done. I generally don't emjoy first person combat games. Call of Duty? No thanks, not for me. However, even though this is technically a first person RPG, I wouldn't have it any other way. If this is a taste of things to come, then I can safely say that the first person gaming was simply made for VR... it just started out a few years before the tech :) Having a skeleton stand right in front of you hammering his rusty blade in your face can be genuinely intimidating. However, being able to lift your own sword (not a mouse/keyboard but an actual physical object in your hand that is perfectly tracked) in order to parry those attacks and then being able to thrust it into it's head to deplete its health is incredibly satisfying.

Sadly, there is a slight negative because things turn a little bit less satisfying once you have equipped the bow and arrow. You see, the AI is not particularly good, and as long as you stay at a distance you can spam your arrows to kill the enemies and they won't even move towards you. They can strafe a little from time to time but as soon as I had the bow all the danger became almost completely inert and that was a real shame. In the end I just put the bow away and only used it when absolutely necessary, ie if enemies could not be reached via melee, but it seems like a silly thing to have to do to get the most enjoyment out of the game.

That said, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms to anybody who has a Vive. Feel free to watch my video (linked at the start of my review) for a general idea of what the game is about, but this won't even begin to give you a taster of the actual experience. The game is great, so I thank the developer for their efforts and I can't wait to see what will be coming next!

23125232,"One of the best, if not the best VR games I've ever played (including Oculus titles). The sense of immersion and feeling you get is leveled by none and the combat system is fantastic. If you like fantasy or RPGs this is a must. The combat starts very easy but by the end of the first section it's bloody hard. As with other RPGs you can choose your style but in this there's no class system - it's just down to you! I ended up dual wielding swords for maximum blocking & damage. The hit reg can be slightly off at times with the sword play but you can physically dodge most of the attacks which is fun! I can't recommend this game enough, though you must be careful with your controllers! (god I hit the wall so many times!)"
23125099,"This is the first ""Real Game"" for me in VR . The others are fun too but this is getting close to be a full fetched game experience. It´s so fucking immersive that you really feel like in the game. 

So far the best game experience in VR that i had- i hope very much for more to come ., I could play this game for hours. Get it now!!!!"
23124622,"Great game! The interface is not very polished and the visuals look like the 1st generation of WOW. 
However, fighting is really amazing. The NPCs respond slowly, particularly in the beginning and they do not really go after you. But that just makes it more enjoyable, as you have a chance to prepare yourself for the combat, choosing the right weapon and positioning yourself somewhat in the middle of the play area."
23123117,"10/10 The best gaming experience I have ever had, on any platform. Ever.

Let me start by saying, this is an early access game, which should make what I will say all the more impactful. Also, to set the context, I am in my mid 40's and remember playing Pong, getting an Atari 2600 in 1977 (coinciding with Star Wars, what a great year), owning Intellivision 1 and 2, Colecovision, NES, IBM PC jr, Commodore 64, XBOXes, PS's, you name it. I like games. I am an avid board gamer, I have designed games and was my groups Dungeon Master in D&D going back to 1980. In terms of VR, I backed DK1, bought a DK2, and own an Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive. I've played every TES game, All of the Ultimas (started with Ultima 2 when it came out.)

This is some next nevel shit....and by that I mean thanks to VR.  skipping some levels that should have somehow been in there in between. All credit to Palmer Lucky and other innovaters for what we are now able to experience. 

Now, some things to get out of the way about this game right now. Be warned, that unless you are someone who enjoys early access to games, this is not for you. I feel this warning should be READ before people buy these titles. It's right there in blue, but people seem to ignore it.

The game is too short at this time. The game does not have realistic monsters, or AAA title graphics. You MUST make sure to set up your Vive perfectly to get the most out of this, and by that I mean make sure your play area is well defined with a good amount of room. Mine is 2m x 2m and my gut tells me that is minimum to REALLY enjoy this game once you start swinging around your weapon. Make sure your hardware supports smooth frame rates with the Vive.

Once all of the finicky parts are set, you can launch into the game. I will say this again, but I don't like the look of the monsters- but I believe most younger gamers will prefer it. I like more ""serious"" looking monsters, just a preference. While you are walking around in the world and interacting with it, this won't matter at all. In the heat of combat, I found it almost startling how something that looks pretty standard on the monitor, can be intimidating once you are fitted into it's scaled den. I love the inventory system, where you only need to look down at your belt and pouches and grab what you need. Eat food to improve health, grab a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, or a staff, or a bow. The immersion factor is top notch. The weapons feel great. Ducking and side stepping ranged attacks feels phenomenal.

I will give you one example in the game to show you why this is the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.

Deep in the heart of a battle with 3 orcs and 2 floating magic users hurling magic fireballs at me, I hurried to a cluster of rocks. I crouched behind the rocks and watched as fireballs just missed me and singed the side of the rocks I was leaning against. I decided to try to pick off the high floating magic users first. I noted that each time I would attack the orcs, these damned MU's would heal them. I grabbed my trusty bow. I waited until a blast hurled past me. I leaned out just enough to see the enemies and focused on the one closest to me. I slowly drew back my arrow, and tried to aim just above the MU, keeping steady. I released the arrow and made a hit. I continued to pound him and when I got him low in HP, he began to heal himself. I knew I had to increase the rate of my hits. I found a better spot to attack him. A barrage of hits met their mark, and I took the first MU down. I used this tactic to take out the other MU, and had to sidestep his balls of fire while making my way to a tree that was good cover, but closer in range to him. Once I dispatched him, I put away my bow and healed up a bit as quickly as I could. I then drew my sword in my right hand, and my shield in the left. I rushed the orcs, and in a fit of slashes I dealt damage to them. I would use the shield to try to block attacks from one, while stabbing and slashing the others. I finally killed them all and took their treasure. I then made my way into a cave opening I spotted, stopping only to catch my breath.

Cons-
Short gameplay (at this point in early access)
Very small number of enemies
Combat can be a little easy (would be great if difficult levels could be added, increasing number, strength, and type of monsters)
Graphics -Not even so much the level of graphics, I prefer a more serious ""look"" to the monsters, similar to TES or old school D&D. However, I really don't care that much that it should detract from my rating. The environments look great.

Pros-
Immersive beyond anything else I have ever done
Pace is good
Just enough story to keep things moving (some more voice acting could be added but not a negative at all)
Inventory system
Weapons, while low in variety, feel great
Atmosphere, good visuals for VR and ambient sound

Summary - Even at this early stage, the greatest gaming experience I have ever had in terms of immersion and feeling as though I was IN a dungeon or ON a mountain etc. Once complete, with added length, variety and difficulty scaling, it will likely be the best entertainment experience (for me) in almost 40 years when I got into Star Wars."
23122981,"The controls and the weapons are truly amazing.
I think the teleport system this game uses is perfect for vive.
I love the inventory system.

I ejoyed this game so much and can't wait to see more contentet.

Please implement random dungeons, random loot and perhaps a skill tree with different classes xD and i would never leave my home again !"
23122568,"One of the best experiences I had so far in VR.
You literally feel like fighting monsters and beeing the hero. 
I am really impressed. Also the level design is very good.
From eating apples by holding it to your mouth to hacking gold out of a mine with a pickaxe.

Overall a great experience, I love every second of it.
A must buy for VR Fans!"
23120988,"I have played this game for an hour or two, and I am loving it so far!  More than any of the other Vive games I have tried, of which so many are single-use tech demos, I feel like this experience showed me the potential of room scale VR gaming.  If you love classic American fantasy RPGs, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.  Allow yourself to suspend disbelief and be transported to another world."
23120883,"Loved this game, the combat works good, you can wield weapons as you wish.  Sword/wand, sword/shield dual wield sword. Only part is the enemies might be a little easy to kill, but an great game!"
23120235,"When I purchased an HTC Vive, my intent was to play flight sims and space sims and the like. I assumed, wrongly, that full body VR would be poorly implemented, and that a game like Vanishing Realms would be dull and uninteresting. I'm not going to mislead anyone here and say the story is particularly original, but if you have a VR setup, you CAN NOT AFFORD NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!
Vanishing Realms absolutely pulled me into a fantasy realm, and made me forget I was a grown man, flailing his arms around with a big buggy looking mask on his face. For a time, I was an adventurer, slowly moving through a dark hall, torch held over my head in one hand, longsword shaking in the other. 
The current chapter of the game will run you two hours of playtime if you take the time to search for treasure and enjoy the story. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment. 
Last thought: if you're not sure whether this game is for you, think back to when you were a kid, swinging a ruler around at imaginary monsters; deep down, you're still that kid, and this game perfectly places you into your younger selfs imaginary battle."
23112364,"Very short, as most VR titles are at the moment, and it's early access.

Not as immersive as other titles, mainly due to the loads of teleporting you will have to do to move, but also other things such as being able to swing your arm all the way through even though your sword is blocked - which simply cant be avoided, but breaks the immersion.

Bow control was quite bad in my opinion.

Not a bad game, but not great either."
23110463,"10/10 would smash barrels again. Great game for VR! Played it on the Vive and beat it. I can't wait for any additional content. It's definitely one of the best games on VR right now. Please release more soon, devs!"
23109323,This is the best VR game I have played so far.  The environment is awesome and fighting is top notch.  I wish I would have bought this sooner.
23108106,"The game is a crude dungeon crawler, just as it promises. Age-old actions like smashing crates, picking up every little coin, and solving simple puzzles are surprisingly compelling when you're in VR. I recommend it. If you've already bought a Vive, then $20 is not bad for the only game that can currently provide hours of full-body VR content and that is very solid compared to the other VR games available to day.

The motion and navigation controls are good. I could play over an hour without motion sickness. I really like that the game prevents you from sticking your head through walls or warping to distant locations...it genuinely feels like you're walking through a dungeon.

It is unfortunate that sword fighting feels like a Wii game instead of real sword fighting, but that's not the developer's fault--swinging a motion control just doesn't have the inertia to inspire realistic motions and you end up just waggling the sword.

The interface for changing weapons and for accessing the inventory needs a bit more design. When you're crouched, you can't access your inventory (I think it goes under the ground due to 3D clipping), and you have to remember to grab the bow with your off hand instead of the one that you'll shoot with. It would be better if weapons were mounted at different points on your body, so that you could really draw a sword or unsling the bow from your back instead of pushing buttons to have them magically appear."
23107479,"Ja, so stelle ich mir VR vor, in der Welt rumlaufen und alles anschauen
bringt fun. Schön wären aber auch deutsche Texte."
23106852,"It's really only one level of a probably much longer game, but what a level! Really impressive and the videos really don't impress the sense of scale. Those skeles are Huge! This looks like the game I've always wanted!"
23106041,"Wow, This is simply an excellent first 3D dungeon expierence game to play with the vive htc system. Lots of fun in a simple  cartoonish game but also makes you feel almost as if your there. Also great exercise for a person who doesn't even want to know they are working out."
23102211,First VR game worth reccomending. Was VERY good. This is the game I will be showing my friends and telling them to try to show off the VIVE gear.
23099449,"The 1st Dungeon , vaguely Zelda-eque VR game.  It was surprisingly longer than I thought it would since it is still the infancy of VR.  There were only a couple of issues like Items on the ground were occassionally lower than my actual floor but overall it was a fun and unique adventure game and it will get even better since the creator is making updates!  A definite buy for Vive owners"
23099283,"An excellant example of what VR can do. I wanted Morrowind in VR and at the moment this is as close as it gets.

Edit: played for an hour non stop with no issues, only stopped to wipe the sweat off my head!"
23098823,"This is great! A very fun experience, the inventory system is intuitive, the combat is great, and the environments are immersive. Very cool. My favorite action game so far, my friends were mind-boggled when they tried it as one of their first VR experiences, also. Can't wait for more content/chapters."
23097279,"Absolutely awesome. Most time so far I've spent in VR. Stressful, scary, exciting and beyond any normal RPG game. if you like stuff like elder scrolls blah blah, you really need to try this."
23095836,"Love this game!

You can pick up a torch and light candles, swing a sword, block with a shield, use bow and arrow, break stuff and loot, kill skeleton warriors, mages, archers and more. The experiance is immersive and fun, would recommend to any HTC Vive owner."
23092850,"This game is, as of today (20.5.2016) in my opinion the best VR-game. Ducking ,taking cover ,avoiding massive fireballs , this game really takes advantage of all aspekts of VR. Additionally ranged and close quarters weapons are avaible."
23092786,各方面都还不错的游戏，画面很精致，挺有代入感的。有剑盾弓法杖等武器，物理攻击是需要自己配合躲闪的，所以空间要求要稍大一些，不然容易挥到家具。故事模式稍微短了一些，但可以作为一个VR的入门游戏介绍给朋友一定可以给他们留下深刻印象。第二幕是类似闯关游戏，游戏性比较单一了，但是这个游戏绝对值这个价钱 :)
23087827,"I'm not through Vanishing Realms yet, but what an exciting experience until now! I can't wait till these kind of games get a Skyrim-like treatment."
23079891,"should say this. This VR game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m + plus sword swing area. ""your ganna hit someone playing this game btw"" il be waiting for more content :P"
23077940,"I played the whole game through with a 2m by 1.5m i hit the wall once you just have to be careful, maybe i have the right amount of open space in swinging distance"
23076293,"A M A Z I N G !

Seriously this is why I bought VR. I had a grin from ear to ear the entire time I was playing this game. If you play this game the way it was meant to be played you will have an absolute blast!. You can of course try to cheat (saw a few videos of people exploiting) but if that's what you are going to do.. why did you buy VR?

I love the combat and with a couple wrist weights on my arm it turned into a realistic workout. I hope more content comes out and a few more monsters. I love what is in the game right now, I was ducking and weaving, the more space you can give this game the better it will play. That being said I was playing just under the 2m X 2m space but I was able to make due just fine, I just wish I had a bit more space.

If you are running room scale VR and always wanted to battle the undead with swords and shields or a bow and arrow then buy this game, seriously, do not hesitate. It may be a bit cartoony but it gets the job done. This is a dungeon crawl that seriously made me glad I bought the Vive over the competition.

Why are you still reading this? Adventures await! This game is worth it at double the price!

Edit - 

I have now used the Oculus Rift and room scale with this game as well as the HTC Vive. I would like to comment on how the game handles with the Rift. The Rift plays quite well with 3 sensor room scale. I did not have any issues at all. I was able to set up the Rift sensors to get good tracking even when on the ground, at times I felt I had better control on the ground with the Rift vs Vive. At no time did I feel any disconnect in the hour I played. I was quite pleased! I then attempted to use the game with only 2 sensors. I would highly not recommend this. This game requires full 360 tracking and 2 sensors will not give you 100%, I was able to get it to a playable level but I did run into disconnect issues with the controllers and it breaks the flow of the game.

If you have 3 sensor room scale for the Oculus Rift this game is a must have!!!!!"
23075789,"This game is really (really really) fun. A little buggy?.., just a little, hardly even noticable. Some very cool VR control interactions that (along with a couple other well done early releasers) are really pretty darn game changing (pun intended). I deem each chapter worth 4.5 hours of content if you are one like I am to triple check every area, look at everything twice, and are driven to ensure not a single coin is overlooked. - Understand Dev is looking to optimize for lower end cards - It would also be nice to hear that there are future plans to optimize for the higher end cards for the highest quality visuals possible."
23075698,"Classic-style dungeon-crawler done VR-style.  Destroy all who stand before you and take their valuables.  Block the skeleton's attacks and counter while their guard is down, dodge the skele-archer's arrows while you close into melee range, or, in the alternative, take cover and pop in/out while peppering them with arrows.  And if you value your life, GTFO of the way of the big skeleton bosses' downward strikes.

AI could use an aggression boost, and the puzzles are a bit simple. Nevertheless, its quite an enjoyable title, and should be fun for the whole family."
23061787,"This is a long time wet dream of mine. This is what I've always wanted from VR. To be the hero. Be in the fantasy world. Swing the sword at monsters, and parry their blows. 

Sure, the game is far from perfect. It's developed by a single person, and while it's amazing what he's achieved, I see that as a con. That's because the game can never be as deep or polished as if if came from a big studio with loads of programming resources. This isn't Skyrim VR, and it probably never will be. 

But, IMHO, the #1 reason why every Vive owner should buy this game is to send a message to those big studios. When Bethesda & co look at Steam sales reports, they should see clear evidence that there is a huge craving for this sort of game."
23056129,"First off, I wanted to say Thank You to the dev/s of this game! You gave this game some love and it shows!
In simple terms; this game is fun!  It's a bit short, but I'm hoping for more content in the future.
It's the little things that stand out for me in this game. They make you feel as if you are actually holding a shield and a sword (or bow and arrow, etc). It really stands out when you compare it to some others like it; yes, you can just wave your sword around, but you can also actually use it!  On the last level, I was getting really good at going around their shields (or under or over) to kill in very few strokes.  The map accuracy for the bows and arrows were surprisingly accurate, allowing for hiding behind cover, aiming without looking (stretch the arms around the corner), dodging incoming arrows, and, for the slow, looking down at the arrows sticking out of you!  LOL, AND they move faithfully when you do, persisting long enough to be disconcerting!
I have now been spoiled; games that don't allow me to clash my sword on my shield really suck!  
The maps were also imaginative and fun, keeping you thinking and on your toes!  
I LOVED the inventory management in this one!  I had a bit of a problem with losing items in between saves, but nothing that mattered (which is probably why they disappeared).  Seriously, the inventory system is worth experiencing all by itself!

I definitely recommend this one and hope for more!"
23051645,游戏很不错，就是没有中文，游戏进度很慢  ，很多地方要自己慢慢摸索，希望出中文的
23051277,holy cow if you had told five year old me that one day i'd be playing a game like this i probably would have invented a time machine.  Really shows off the potential for gaming/fantasy rpg in the vive.  left me wanting more and more.  I made a 2 minute review of the game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LdXF_aV22c&index=13&list=PLW1QIXVDNQYki47m3O9KAxdhnK59xGR7x
23051127,好玩是好玩，就是太短了。。。
23049868,The dungeon crawl i've been waiting for :)
23048446,VR绝对不能错过的一款游戏
23047780,Great game. Give me more!
23044947,"Quel plaisir de découvrir ce jeu, les graphismes sont bons, les controlleurs vous plongent au coeur de l'action. On regrette juste la durée de cet épisode qui se termine en à peine 3 heures, vivement les prochains épisodes.
Avec Vanishing Realms, on entrevoit vraiment les possibilités de la VR, et on imagine déjà les futurs jeux.
C'est pour moi l'une des meilleures expériences VR que j'ai pu tester. Et je la conseil à tous les heureux possésseurs de Vive."
23042666,"Exactly what i was looking for in VR.
Keep up the good work!"
23042248,"OMG!  This game is amazing.  If you love dungeon crawlers, spend the cash and get this game.  My fovorite of everything I have played thus far for the Vive.

When I got my first sword and was able to turn it around and look at it, it was an expericence I have never had before.   WOW!!

My first battle with a skeloton was exhilirating!  

Great Game.

Long live the Vive!"
23039583,"Really immersive and awesome experience. It's kind of like of a unpolished diamond. The ending wasn't as satisfying as I expected and some things could have been done a bit differently, but overall a great game. Best experience on the Vive so far.

Punched the backwall of my shelf and broke it in the clash of fighting two huge monsters. Loved it.

4.5 / 5 | Would recommend."
23037242,I have been playing this game for abought two and a half hours. Its one of the best V.R. games thats out the room needed is a little much and i keep hiting walls. But some of the most fun i have had yet.
23032943,"This game isnt bad but like many VR experiences on the store there isn't much meat on its bones. With vanishing realms we are given a very short taste of what a virtual first person RPG could be like. You will explore, collect loot, unlock doors and fight monsters and that's pretty much it. I completed all the content available in about 100 minutes and by the end of it I would say that yes I had a good time. If you are desperate to play something on your new VR headset you can do worse than this game but be warned this title has more in common with an amusement park ride than an epic RPG. Chances are if you had enough money to buy a VR headset then the 19.99 asking price isnt outside your realm of affordability just don't go in expecting allot of bang for your buck."
23031818,"Well, damn. This is way better than I was expecting, particularly for Early Access. Solid engagement, interesting mechanics, and some fun surprises. AI is a bit derpy, but feasible. Plays ok as a lefty."
23031761,"This is one of my favorite VR games so far. I really hope we see more games like this in the future! 

Pros:
-I am a big fan of the item belt and really didn't have any issues with inventory management. I used the simple tactic of putting useful items like the pick and torch in my left pouch and put food and potions in the right pouch and it works like a charm.
-Love the feel and atmosphere of the game world, I spent a few minutes in each area just looking around. You really feel like you are in a dank dungeon or mine. 
-Combat is fun and a little channenging at times (especially against two or more foes). The hit detection could use a little work, but I imagine that its hard to get a virtual sword with 1:1 motion controls to work and feel right. After all the sword and the skelleton you are swinging at are not really there. Over all I was impressed with how fun the combat is. 
-The puzzles, while not hard, required some thought.
-Felt very much immersed in the game. This is one of those games you say ""Oh, Ill boot that up and play for 15 min."" and then end up pulling the headset off an hour later saying ""Wow! that was fun!""
-Felt like I was getting just a taster of what games will be like in a few years time. After my first hour in the game, I put it down and though ""I really hope we see a major AAA game in this style."" 
- Enemies feel intimidating and do protect themsevles well. They attempt to block or dodge arrows, and will cover up or step back if they are taking a beating. Also, watching my wife dancing across the room in an all out  fencing duel with thin air is always fun.
- Mini bosses and bosses were very fun and, I think, a great addition to the game. There are 6 types of enemies and each feel different and have different fighting styles/tactics. I found that killing them in the order of [spoiler] Healer -> Ranged -> melee [/spoiler] helped a lot, and was required in some fights. 

Cons:
- While satisfied with the game at the $20 asking price, I want more! I had a lot of fun playing this, and cant wait for the devs to make a sequel or similar. (beat the game in about 2 hours) 
- Sometimes when looking down at the inventory belt the HMD will slide up your face a tiny bit and make what you are trying to see blur. Not a huge problem and may not be an issue for people who can get their Vive securely glued to thier face. But with my giant head, I found myself reaching up and holding the Vive in place so I could see a few times.
- Because you are swinging the controllers around and moving quite a bit to dodge fireballs and arrows the game tries to keep you in the center of the play area so you dont hit something. This causes the game to pause with a screen that tells you to return to the center of the room and press pause to resume. While a fantastic idea so I dont break things, it does cut into the immersion a bit, sometimes popping up in the middle of a fight. a larger play area would probably help this a lot. (my play area is 2.2x2.1m)"
23031334,"What a wonderful game and experience. 

As a fan of RPG's (and I've played ALOT) this is a great pioneer in the realm of VR. This is NO DOUBT a peak into the future of video games and what is to come.  

This game (along with a Vive) gives you the chance to experience playing an RPG like never before. In real life you can dodge arrows, spells, or the swing of an enemy sword. Use your shield or just step to the side in real life within your play area. Being able to duck and dodge by real body movements provides an amazing immersion experience. But do yourself a favor and be sure to use headphones and not speakers, helps a TON with the immersion. 

I highly recommend this game if you have a Vive, worth every penny."
23031118,"You are thrown into a dark, yet charming world to explore that is very well crafted and highly immersive. There are secrets to be found, and enemies to be slain. My only complaint is the cover art for the game. It doesn't jive with the feel of the game, but man is this a good game!"
23029890,"The definitive RPG for the Vive - this game is fun and functional and yet manages to not feel overly linear. The biggest negative is the clunky, inaccurate and slow AI. The melee combat is awesome, but once you get the bow of your choice the game really becomes fun. I can't recommend this enough!"

Pros:
- Incredibly immersive, like a fun D&D game brought to life
- Challenging combat, but not artificially inflated difficulty
- Perfect showcase for room scale VR
- Delivers powerful sense of presence

Cons:
- Unpolished visuals
- Clunky inventory

Final Score: 8/10 - GREAT"
23028748,"Must have game for any RPG fan! This gives a glimpse into the possibilities of VR and offers one of the most fun and engaging Vive experiences at launch.

Game runs absolutely fine on my GTX 780, no noticable frame drops or any issues."
23028449,"Amazing game. Only 1 down side. I WANT MORE. 

Make a new game plus. Restart with all your weapons etc....

"
23027461,"Very good but very short, I got about 2 hours of gameplay out of it and showed a couple of friends.
I'd definitely like to see some DLC, I'd pay 10 dollars for a couple more chapters as I believe would most people who played the game.
Second chapter is too short (20/25 mins), I'd stop calling it a chapter. First chapter was absolutley amazing! MOOORREE"
23027095,"The game is short. My run took about 100 minutes. But it is nicely wrapped up in a package that feels complete story-wise (not that there is much of story).

But if you have a Vive, this title is well worth it as there is nothing else like it.

It is quite fun to beat up skeletons in swordfights. One thing that could have made it better would be if the AI was a bit better. Right now the enemies just stand there even if you are fighting one of their buddies literally 2 m away. It would be ok if they would pull from a larger radius so you would get a couple more fights where you face more than one at a time.
Also, the bow. The bow right now is sort of overpowered due to infinite arrows, and enemies at a distance will most of the time just stand there while you shoot at them over and over until they die - even if there is a fairly obvious path to you, and even if it's a ""boss"". Perhaps making arrows a limited resource would help. E.g. you could loot some arrows from the arrow-filled skeletons you find, and the bowmen you kill. On the other hand that means there should be some other way to kill bowmen on unreachable ledges (orberhaps you will be forced to just dodge them)."
23025279,"This game is awesome, first game to take you truely into another world. (if you let it)
When playing this game don't blink around, stand your ground in a fight and you'll have a blast.
USE YOUR PLAYSPACE TO FIGHT. (but carefull, I forgot there were walls in reallife XD)

It's short but true, I tried most of the other vive games, but for now this is still the one for me.
(even if it currently is short on game play, it's a work in progress)

I recommend this game to all who own a vive or expecting one, and let yourself be taken in by the awesome experience.

Can't wait for more content, keep up the good work Dev.
"
23024365,This is my favorite game for the vive by far. You really feel like your fighting for your life in a dungeon. I couldn't help but swear at the enemies I fought. Super intense and a pretty good workout. I'm sure there is a way to cheese the game and not move like your in a real sword battle but that would ruin this intense combat. Well priced for a short experience. The game hints that there will be more content. I will buy immediately.
23022949,"This was one of my first Vr games i Bought and i have to say i am glad i started out with this game! when you play this game with a room scale play area the experince is insain It honestly feels like you are really there! i would give this game a 10\10.  i would highly recomend this game as one of your first games to buy! and if you want to see someone demo the game for you you can watch my play though to see if this game is right for you!

https://youtu.be/zA7PxbM8_Vk"
23020722,"Perhaps the best VR experience I've eve had.  It's an embodiment of what VR can do for gaming, and needs to be expanded upon."
23019442,Very cool game! I can't play scary games but this has a good balance of cute and scary. The combat is very physical and fun and the enviroments are great.
23016567,"Je chope ma première épée. Je reviens sur mes pas, tiens un levier. Je l'abaisse, rien. Je me retourne mais j'entends un bruit dans mon dos. WTF un squelette de même taille que moi ! Par Elvis, il m'a enlevé la moitié de ma vie ! Heureusement, je prends la pomme dans mon inventaire et je la porte (littéralement) à ma bouche. 
Sérieux, le jeu est facile et court mais quand on pense qu'on à affaire au 1er rpg VR..."
23013321,This is a taste of what RPG games will be like in VR.
23013145,My favorite VR experience so far. Very immersive and well made.
23012289,vr游戏的经典 制作  绝对值得一玩！
23012073,"This is a fantastic VR experience and the developer deserves as much support as possible to continue building on Vanishing realms.

Some of the systems need a bit of tweaking but overall the Combat and enemy AI feel really great. Also the recent improvements to the inventory system are excellent.

Really recommended if having the feeling of being inside a World of Warcraft dungeon appeals to you. Awesome title and cannot wait for more."
23011266,"Overall, Vanishing Realms is an OK step toward VR RPGs but feels unfinished and overpriced at $20. What it gets right: Inventory system is innovative and works. Movement mechanics and graphics are good enough. What it fails at: Level design leaves a lot to be desired (some areas are outright confusing and not thought-out leaving you moving in circles or stuck). Fighting mechanics feels unfinished (hits don't register half the time). Story is superficial at best."
23010192,"Incredible. It is visually well done, the game play is fun and convincing. There is quite a bit to explore, although it is a little short it is definitly one of my favorite titles out right now. Anyone that likes adventure and a few puzzles mixed in this is the game for you."
23008222,"I remember as a kid, back in 1982 when The Warlock of Firetop Mountain book (Steve Jackson, Ian Livingstone - legends) came out.
Armed with pencil and paper and my trusty 2D6 (thats 2 six sided dice for the uninitiated), I was instantly transported into a dungeon which was populated with monsters, traps and puzzles.
It was mind blowing.
It was groundbreaking.
Vanishing Realms is the WOFTM of the VR age.
In five years time, we'll look back in fondness for this game as we play Skyrim VR.
-- if I had a gripe, it would be about not having enough traps :)
That's why you keep a halfling on the end of a 10 feet pole (old D&D joke).

"
23006803,"This game was by far the most immersive experience I've had on my Vive so far. Absolutely loved the UI and overall feel of the game. Can't wait for more content to come, I feel this game is damn good already but just needs a lot more levels and puzzles as well as more combat arena levels. I'd love to see a level editor so we can make our own maps too!

I highly recommend this game, you will love it I promise!

Some suggestions for future development: 
~ Shield Bashing 
~ Hammers do damage through armor but reduced
~ Fire arrows
~ Another, larger shield
~ More destruction of stuff (really fun)
~ Grappling hook
~ run down the list of Zelda items haha"
23005586,Archi-périmé.
23002726,"I loved the game so much! 
If you ever played a Fantasy Pen&Paper and woundered what it felt like to fight giant Skelettons with Sword, Shield, Bow or Magic, this is the Game for you!
Very immersive Dungeon Crawler with hidden Secrets, Traps and Riddles.
Can´t wait for more Levels

23002562,"Is a very nice game but too short. I mean, SHORT. Two hours later i finished the game. Is a lot of money for a few hours. But, still, if you want to see the next way of videogames you should play this game, very short game."
23001461,"Cool proof of concept. Boring game. Essentially non-existent AI. Terrible Graphics. 

Generally good use of VR mechanics and innovation from among the first batch of early stage developers. But still a lot of room for growth.

If you are an early adopter, buy it. It's a nice experience given the current playing field of games. 

If you are buying a Vive in a few months after this review is out, I hope there are substantially better games on the market for you to consider.
"
23001053,"Short game, but it was expected. However it was really hard to stop playing! Jabbing, stabbing, slashing and just going nuts was epic. This is how VR games should evolve, if diablo/skyrim/fallout etc, had been anything this, it would have been so epic that you would have have to spend months exporing and just getting things done. Very good game, one of the best so far!

Sure there are bugs, but you get past it, so who cares."
23000986,"I've tried quite a few VR-Games for my vive over last few weeks (close to 20) I'd say this is the one that feels the most like an actual finished Game. And boy it is good! the sword fights are the best VR-Interaction I've had so far, definetly buy this it's worth the money. 

Only thing I would like more: if you could do ""artificial walking"" instead of teleporting. I know a lot of people get motion sick from that but if it was added as an option for the ones whos stomaches have adopted to VR enough I think it would increase the immersion a lot."
23000578,"So for my first review: Vanishing Realms is absolutely amazing. When i purchased it i thought the graphics won't allow me to feel like i will believe being in the game myself with the vive, but boy was i wrong. When the first fight came up i actually strated to dodge, which let to one of the pictures on the wall being damaged >.<, but that's my fault. I really enjoyed playing the game, tho it's not very long(yet?). I really hope that we get some more content, because i am absolutely sold. Keep up the great work and if you think about buying it or a vive, this should be the first game you get."
22998113,One of the best VR games available now. It's very short and pricey but the experience shouldn't be missed.

22996017,"[H1]Vorab Information[/H1]

Fast ein Jahr ist vergangen seitdem ich mein Review hier geschrieben habe. Jetzt möchte ich es auffrischen:

Vanishing Realms ist sicherlich ein sehr gutes VR RPG (wobei die allgemeine Liste der VR RPGs recht klein ist) aber dennoch hat dass Spiel auch ein paar Macken, später mehr dazu.

Ich brauchte knapp 2.5 Stunden um das gesamte Spiel durch zu spielen (dabei habe ich sehr langsam gespielt und mir jede Ecke des Games genauer angeschaut). Das SPIEL (keine Erfahrung!) ist im allgemeinen das Geld wert aber nachdem die Storykomponente einmal beendet wurde gibt es keinen Wiederspielwert denn alle Items wurden bereits erbeutet und ich logge mich nicht nochmal ein nur weil ich einen Erfolg haben möchte, den ich bekomme wenn ich 50 Kerzen angezündet habe.



[H1]Negativ[/H1]

- Kein Wiederspieltwert! Du wirst das Spiel vermutlich nicht nochmal starten nachdem du die Story abgeschlossen hast. Es wäre sehr schön gewesen wenn sich der Developer ein System hätte einfallen lassen, dass den Spieler auch nach Beendigung der Story weiterhin beschäftigt.

- Es gibt lediglich eine einzige Möglichkeit sich Fortzubewegen (Teleport). Gerade in Kampfsituation hätte ich mir gewünscht nicht erst nach einem Platz zum teleportieren suchen zu müssen.

- Das ständige Bücken (wenn man so wie ich jedes Goldstück aufheben will) ist wirklich nicht sehr freundlich. Der Loot sollte immer in Spielerhöhe leicht zu greifen sein.

- Das Userinterface ist so lala, es funktioniert zwar, wird aber zum Ende des Spieles unglaublich unübersichtlich und überfüllt sich. So greift man schließlich anstatt zum Schwert dann doch zum Bogen oder Zauberstab.

- Monster droppen nur Gold/Mana. Ich hätte mir sehr gewünscht das Monster (gerade die Stärkeren) auch Ausrüstung droppen (so wäre eine wirklich Klassische RPG Komponente abgedeckt).

- Kein Aufleveln.

- Die Story wird nur auf Englisch (kein leicht verständliches Englisch) und über In-Game Texte erzählt.

- Gelegentliche Bildfehler beim Teleportieren (vor allem wenn man sich draußen Aufhält).

- Relativ niedrig aufgelöste Texturen (Der Stil ist trotzdem stimmig aber es könnte deutlich besser sein). Ich vermute das an sehr vielen Stellen Assets gekauft und benutzt wurden (völlig i.O und verständlich).



[H1]Positiv[/H1]

- Die Story lässt sich ganz gut spielen aber geht definitiv unter wegen dem herausragendem Kampfsystem

- Die allgemeine Stimmung im Spiel wird sehr gut umgesetzt. Man hat immer das Gefühl von einer ""höheren Macht"" beobachtet zu werden.

- Stimmige Soundeffekte mit Hall etc.

- Man kann mit sehr vielen Objekten interagieren, so lassen sich zum Beispiel Fässer zerstören und Heuhaufen und Banner in Brand setzen.

- Überall sind kleine Pokale versteckt die man sich erbeuten kann. Im Grunde wird man für alles was man in Brand setzt oder zerstört belohnt.



[H1]Fazit[/H1]

Ich empfehle jedem Spieler der sich für RPGs interessiert Vanishing Realms auszuprobieren. Das Geld ist das Spiel defintiv wert und vor kurzem gab der Developer bekannt, dass er nun an der dritten Erweiterung arbeitet. Wer dauerhaften Spaß sucht sollte erst noch abwarten um zu sehen ob der Entwickler daran arbeitet einen Wiederspielwert in das Spiel einzubauen.

Alles in allem gibt es von mir eine Kaufempfehlung und eine Bewertung mit 7/10 Sternen.


Für die, die Vanishing Realms schon durch gespielt haben und jetzt auf neuen Content warte, hier meine Spieletipp: Trickster VR (ähnlich zu Vanishing Realms aber mehr Fokus auf Kampf und Waffen).


Viel Spaß"
22987086,"Absolutely amazing game. Even though it's Early Access, the game is mostly complete as-is. The only thing I want in this is more to the story, and more of the game. The bow and arrow mechanic is a wee bit fiddly (not quite as easy to use as The Lab's), the ending puzzle was a bit hard to grasp at first, and the quantized positioning for access to your bags and such was a little annoying at times, but overall, excellent game, and fits exactly with the Vive's mission."
22986816,"Best VR game for now! very well done! Maybe only the fights could be more fast

I don't understand how finish the game, I'm at the end o the game (I think) In a dark room with an open book but I don't know what I should do
"
22982896,Best game on the Vive! (May 2016)
22981884,"Very nice use of room scale in VR, your in a role playing game and shoot the arrows and use swords and magic. Still a short but I enjoyed every minute playing."
22979972,"This is my favorite VR game to date.  Love the feel of it.  The opponents do change how they react to you based on how you attack them.  Certainly had several ""moments"" throughout playing they game where I just started laughing because it was so much fun.  Looking forward to the next chapters when they are released.  If you loved old dungeon crawlers, then this is a must for anyone who has VR."
22978798,This is a great way of doing RPG.  It fun and the interface isnt in your way.  Great job guys!
22976053,希望能有中文
22970514,"This is the first single player Vive game I've played for hours (and I've tried quite a few after almost two weeks).  The weapons feel great, the puzzles are fun, the combat is challenging, the atmosphere is great, and the artistic style is quite cool.

The only negatives about it:
1.  The teleportation is a bit too easy and it can make you feel slightly odd.  
2.  This is definitely made for bigger spaces.  2m x 2m might be pushing it (I'm playing less than recommended at 1.8 x 2.8).  You might just bust a hole through your wall- though, the game does have a good way of preventing you from doing this by pausing automatically when you get too close.
"
22969594,"Looking at the preview video, I thought this looked a little cheesy. The graphics seemed dated and cartoonish. As soon as I launched the game I forgot all of that. I felt fairly immersed in the game (the only real immersion killer for me was my earbuds-great sound but they have a long cord that kept getting tangled with the headset cord and pulling out of my ears).  I felt like a total boss facing 3 Skeles at once, blocking thrusting, parrying, and ducking the big skeletons morning star and counter attacking is a truly epic feeling. The enemy AI could use some tweaking, as they tend to stand around until you get close. I do like that after a couple arrows to the face they start ducking and blocking.  One improvement my be a knockback for the bosses. I found that if I got really close there attacks didnt land. I look forward to seeing more chapters"
22969394,"I just cannot get over how neat this game is.  I'm not terribly far in but just fighting dudes, smashing pots, looking for gold, collecting, loot, holy crap this is super neat.  

I'm only a few hours in but I am having a blast.

Edit:  So I finished the game.  Keep in mind, it's really really short.  I am still giving this a positive review but just know that when you finish you'll have a ""wait, that's it?"" reaction.  It only feels like you finished the first chapter.  There is plenty that still needs to be fixed and added to this game.  Namely the AI on the monsters.  They're just dumb.  Still, it's fun playing but once the VR magic wears off you'll start to see some issues in the game.

Regardless, I want more.  Please give me more.  I am worried that the next ""chapter"" in this game will also be $20.  $20 for about 2 hours of content is a bit much.

Regardless, VERY VERY VERY AWESOME STUFF!"
22966417,"Best buy since i recive my VIVE. Absolutly worth it, but to short. I am addicted and want more :)"
22964697,Un rêve de gosse devient réalité avec ce jeu.
22963820,"I just completed the two chapters and wish there was more. The game is solid, though rather like being sucked, Tron like, into a Nintendo GameCube fantasy adventure, which is no bad thing!

So far the most enjoyable VR game I have played in as much as it has felt like an immersive adventure, as well as a VR 'experience'.

Slow moving at times, which may put some people off, and a couple of the puzzle activations can be a little obscure (for my tiny mind anyway).

I really hope it does well enough to warrant further expansions - it certainly deserves it, credit to the dev.
"
22963539,"Wow! What an experience! After you've done all the free VR demos and their novelty has worn off, this is the game to try next. It's a proper VR game, properly made for the Vive. Even though it's Early Access it feels very polished and the content is well made. The combat is fantastically well done! It's RPG come to life!"
22962855,"That is how RPG's should be played. There is no abstraction of the gameplay. No click this or that. No button smashing. Just do what you want. Grab the sword, block the attacks. Take the torch and reach to the candles on the wall to light them. Look under the table or bend over to look inside the chest and grab the coins and treasures.

Parrying and hitting with the sword is satisfying, although the incoming attacks of the enemies are very predictable after some time. The levels are very nice and i like the inventory system. 

In future i would like to have a more grown up theme/design for this kind of games and interesting dialogs. And of course it is too short as always."
22962076,"This game is absolutely amazing and epitomizes everything I had hoped VR could deliver. Other developers would do well to study this game very closely.

The interactions with the world are so well implemented that this provides the deepest sense of presence that I've felt in a VR game. I was giddy and had a ridiculous grin on my face the first time I found a pickaxe and started wailing on ore deposits. Just holding a torch is a simple joy and illustrates what a massive difference a simple little thing like holding a light source in your hand and moving it around to move things in and out of shadow can have on immersion.

The visuals are cartoony but still impressive and a pleasure to look at. I'd love to see a more realistic rendering of this world in VR, but I am by no means complaining. The world is lovely.

The combat is great too. The mix of ranged and melee combat gives you a nice variety. There's nothing quite like standing up against multiple opponents with your sword and shield in hand, trying to deflect and counter their rain of blows. Hiding behind cover and peeking your head out to shoot of an arrow is a lot of fun too."
22956153,"A real good game. Play it 30 minutes, and you'll forget who you are and where you really are ! Good immersion, and it is pleasant to have a real game, not any short experience. 1 chapter (1h30) and 1 arena (20 min) for the moment, can't wait to have more. 

For those who like First person Role/action games (no craft, no experience, no perks thow)."
22955534,"One of the longer and more entertaining VR games so far. Melee combat could be better, but spells and and archery work great. Overall, a decent adventure game. I wish it was longer."
22952125,還不錯，就是劇情有點短和英文詩看不懂
22947206,Best first person game on VR to date!
22934539,"I have not yet finished it, but Vanishing Realms is my favorite VR game in my library.  Before I experienced full room VR, this is the type of game that I had hoped to play.   It has exceeed my already high expectations."
22932795,"Great VR game. Part I is a dungeon explorer with you exploring and looting.  Monster fights are a lot of fun and easy to get carried away, I nearly broke my window hacking a monster.
Wasn't overly keen on part II which is just a series of arena battles. I hope future parts go back to the dungeon explorer format.

Cons. Pretty expensive for such a short playtime experience. But considering it's a single developer it is an amazing achievement, and I am happy to fund future content,"
22932496,"This game was a fun exp, it is short but the time i soent playing was exciting.  Some of the larger mobs have graphic and range issues. 

I dont think any game to this point is worth over $20 they are all just to short, and they are not clear about how expantions will work, but in my opinion on of the best out at this time."
22927459,"Very good Gameplay, got to say one of the best VR experiance's yet.

Combat is great fun and then there's the magic and treasure, awesome what more could you want.

Highly recommend."
22923446,"I'm changing my review from ""Recommended"" to ""Not Recommended"". 

I know this game is great !!, but it's just so short for 19.99 $, and there hasnt been any impressive update to this game since it was released..."
22922474,"This game was fantastic, one of the first games ive found that tries to be something more than a gussied-up tech demo. It felt like I was inside one of my other favorite games, Torchlight 2. Immersion was so intense I slammed my controllers into the wall during combat more than once!

This is absolutely one of the best VR titles right now, and im left wanting more content. Do yourself a favor and buy this game."
22921947,"I did not enjoy the combat at all. The bow felt super inferior to the bow in The Lab, which is free. The swordplay is weird because the best strategy is to teleport as close as you can and wiggle your sword. The monsters instantly back away when they're low health after you've parried their attack and go to stab them for messing up. That is super dumb and doesn't drive me to actually hit them, it drives me to just want the fight to be over because the AI can just back up out of range instantly. 
The physics on objects are weird. With unity and unreal having VR plugins that a ton of people are using, and both of them being free, that's not really excuseable anymore."
22920508,"Just the other day I had a look at this game and thought, ""Ugh, looks overpriced and pretty gimmicky - even for a VR game."" I decided to take the plunge, as much for lack of other content as anything.

This has been the single best experience I've ever had in gaming - by a wide margin. Not just VR, everything.

Tips to super-enjoying this:

1. Let yourself be immersed. Try and BE the character you're playing. I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there.
2. Move around frequently in your play-space. Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often. So just make sure you shift around a lot. Be free.
3. If you do 1. right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they're going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit. It'll put the hairs up on the back of your neck.

Legit criticisms:

1. AI is pretty crap in this. Enemies aren't smart and just sit there staring at you even though you're only 2 meters away.
2. AI fights incredibly slowly. This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing.
3. AI doesn't really adapt to your fight style - I'm sure this will be fixed in other games given time. But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land.
4. Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn't matter too much since you get lost in the moment.
5. MOAR CONTENT! Left me desperate for more.

Conclusion:

This is the single best entertainment experience I've ever had. This game is amazing. It's a cliche, but seriously: this game is a must-have.

If you don't have a Vive. Get a Vive. Get this game. No joke."
22920410,"Very enjoyable game, and immursive. I'd love to see the abiliy to control my character by walking instead of teleporting. Perhaps an option to do this? Also, if more levels will be added, I'm hoping that they will be at a competitive price

Pros:
- Very immersive
- Simple but interesting graphics and lighting
- Controls are great and feel solid

Cons:
- Too Short. For $20 I would hope for a few more chapters
- Monsters dont feel very threatening because the AI is limited and attacks are very repetitive"
22920224,When that first skeleton pops out and you sword to sword combat it ! lol dreams do come true
22917822,"This game is just unreal. What a world. My favorite game on the Vive, because it's an adventure, with an atmosphere. The graphics and sounds are immersive, it is quiet a slap in the face ! Don't hesitate, get it !"
22917110,The best Game i've seen so far for the vive. Stunning!
22913822,"Interesting little game. Normally this kind of game is the opposite of what I play but I found myself hooked and finished it all ...

1) Graphics : could be better, I dont think they are using the whole resolution of HTC Vive/Oculus headsets.
2) Control : very well done, teleport works well, fighting is well made. Also, when the fight is taking you off your gameplay limits, the game automatically pauses, shows you where to walk to come back in the middle of your gameplay area, and then resumes. This is a fantastic idea I have not seen anywhere else.
3) Gameplay : great. I dont understand how such a young game style can be so appealing ... The puzzle are very well thought.

Bottom line : this game is an early access, but I think this is because the story is not completed yet, not because of the game features (which are stables and well made).
"
22913611,"This is the first ever review I have written for a game on Steam.  I was motivated to write it because, out of all the VR games I own, this has been the most fun and awe-inspiring experience on the HTC Vive to date.  It's basically a Zelda-like game where you are actually inside the dungeon.  I own many other VR games and in my opinion this is way better than Job Simulator and the Lab, which feel more like VR tech demos.  Vanishing Realms is a very short game.  I was able to complete the available content in a little less than 3 hours or so.  It does have a lot of interesting mechanics and once you get used to the movement and combat, it is one of those games that make you salivate about what the future of VR has in store.  I am not going to describe the game itself, as you can get that from the Store page.  I will describe the experience though.  

The initial chapter of the game sees your character locked inside a dungeon that you must try to escape by finding keys, following hints in riddles or defeating various types of enemies.  It is very immersive, and you really feel as if you are inside this world, to the point that I often found myself swinging my ""sword"" outside the playable area and bashing my furniture (make sure you have enough room to play as the game suggests a larger playing area than most other games).  Fighting multiple enemies is fun and sometimes challenging, as enemies will change their attack patterns after a bit and dodge your arrows and magic attacks.  The weapons right now are limited to three different swords and a hammer for melee, two different bows and a fire magic wand for ranged attacks.  Enemies vary based on their abilities and you will find yourself fighting skeleton warriors, archers, mages (as well as healers) and a few bigger baddies and bosses.  Once you complete the initial dungeon, you are teleported to an arena-style area where you have to defeat all the enemies within a time limit in order to complete the game.  The game has various checkpoints whereby you can save your progress by walking over them.

I own several other VR games such as Holopoint, VR Minilands Golf, Job Sim, the Lab, The Blue, etc (just check my game list).  Vanishing Realms doesn't have a high replayability index, but is a way better experience for the price than many other VR games available now.  The only downsides to this game are its brevity, the lack of guidance at certain points (although it's not that hard to figure out) and the semi-ambiguous ending, although it does seem like the developer is working on more content.  I have to say that at this point, this is the only VR game I own that I have been motivated to play all the way through.

Again, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who owns the Vive and wants to get a good idea of what VR can potentially offer in a gaming experience.  I really felt like I was inside this world and I would be completely immersed in the fights and the game mechanics.  Some things could still use a bit of polish but I definitely think this is an experiencee worth checking out if you are into VR."
22905996,"It's rudimentary gameplay and simple storyline attest to the infancy of consumer virtual reality, but don't let that fool you.  Vanishing Realms is to SteamVR what Super Mario Brothers was to the NES - an outstanding introduction to a burgeoning new realm of possibilities.  This SHOULD BE the first game every new VR owner should play."
22904901,"Vanishing Realms is the single most polished RPG experience in the Vive's launch line up. The game is extremely fun in the current state and I hope we'll see quite a bit more content added by the time the game is out of Early Access. The hand to hand combat is fun, the ranged combat with the bow is great as well. The game scratches my itch for exploration in all the right places. I am eagerly awaiting more chapters."
22903077,"Very awesome game. It is like being inside Legend of Zelda. Of course early access means it needs to be fleshed out and needs more saves. It has a couple areas where performance takes a hit. It's nice that the dev added some time trial combats after what must be the first level is complete, so even though you finish the currently available campaign you can keep playing through timed combat. If the final is at least 10-20 times longer then I'll be happy that I got in early."
22901226,"I honestly did not know what to expect when purchasing this game but to my surprise it turns out to be a wonderfully immersive world that ranks right up there with The Gallery. It is a early access game that is quite polished. Anyone looking for a VR dungeon RPG, this is your game."
22900226,"Just incredible!

That is, how RPG's need to be for room-scale VR!"
22897809,"This is the kind of game I was hoping for with VR games in general. My first moments in the game I just stood there awe-struck because it was so fantastic. I love getting to feel like I'm holding a sword and shield and actually having to manuver around enemies' shields to strike them. 

While you still can't actually walk throught the world, the teleport system is pretty good and doesn't take you out of immersion. In fact sometimes it immerses me even more if I didn't pay attention to how close to an edge I went and look down and suddenly see a drop down. I'm actually afraid I'm going to fall!

I very much look forward to the release of more content for this game and hope to see others similar to it in the near future."
22895710,"Great game, hoping to see more soon. Played through in a relatively short time but did enjoy it thoroughly. The weapons are easy to use and enjoyable, the game play mechanics are easy to pick up and exploring is fun. Don't know if it's going to be a separate purchase per episode, really hoping it's a package deal. Would pay for a second episode it is as least twice as long and as engrossing or more. One of the best experiences I have had with the Vive."
22892733,Awesome game.
22892425,Einfach nur ein geiles Gefühl ... Zwei Daumen hoch !!
22891974,"After playing dungeon crawling games like Diablo and Zelda in your younger days, have you ever wave an invisible sword and shield around pretending that you are the hero bashing and killing monsters around you? I know I have. And Vanishing Realm made my dreams come true.

Made by an ex-Valve dev (yes, singular), Vanishing Realm puts players into, quite literally, the boots of a lone adventurer, armed only with his/her wits and thirst for adventure. The cartoony nature of the game may seem like a mood breaker for some, but trust me when I say all these will go away once you hold the sword in your hand for the first time, or when you that huge skeleton swung its flail right above your head as you franctically ducked instinctively.

The battle was fluid and engaging, requiring players to parry, dodge and attack with good timing and precision. However, once you get used to the mechanics, it can get a little too easy, even in boss fights. The variety of weapons is also quite limited at this time as the game is still in early access. 

However, the potential of this game is huge and it could very well revolutionise dungeon crawling adventure games as Ocarina of Time did at the time of its release. Definately recommend this game if you fancy this genre!"
22890299,"Well worth the purchase. I was disappointed when the game ended, but only because I wanted to play more. I felt like I was inside of Ocarina of Time, but with better graphics. Can't wait for the next chapters."
22889008,"The first enemy scared the hell out of me when he appeard and swung his weapon down on me. Admittedly, I made a not-sexy noise, but this visceral fear caused me to raise my sword to protect my head from the attack as if I was in real danger. There was no tutorial or guide on how to block attacks. No button to press. Just reflex.

After about an hour in this game my legs ached from walking/ducking/dodging, my arms were tired from fighting monsters, and my character’s health was low so I took a break by sitting on my bedroom floor under a beautiful tree. Leaves fell all around me. Birds were chirping. The wind was blowing. Particles swam in a sunbeam. I reached into my virtual satchel, pulled out an apple, brought it to my mouth, and slowly “ate” it as it replenished my health. Sitting there regaining my virtual and real-life stamina was the most peaceful, beautiful, and interconnected experience I have ever had with technology. Half-man, half-machine. Nirvana through escapism. By the way, I opened my mouth to eat the apple and hit my teeth with the controller. I've also tried to set my controllers on tables that don't exist multiple times.

If you are reading this review a couple of years after the Vive's release I am sure there will be better games to spend your money on. But as a launch title this is among the best available. I highly recommend it."
22887494,"Love this VR dungeon crawler!!  Health bar, gold, weapons, inventory by your waist?  Sign me up!"
22882778,Bon jeu d'aventure en VR.
22880955,Wow. Just wow. This really shows what VR is capable of. Enjoyed this very much.
22880361,"I just had a sword fight with an 8ft skeleton, mined gold and solved puzzles in VR. 

This is the future of gaming!"
22878551,"Great game, SO worth the price... I hope other developers catch on to the style and immersion Vanishing Realms offers. More More Moar!"
22877236,"经典的RPG玩法，配合HTCVIVE感受真实打怪（而且武器多样化），真的给人很好的体验，目前游戏部分虽然比较完整，但是感觉还没过瘾就结束啦（2个小时左右……），期待开发商的后期内容~
PS：游戏的UI互动设计真的太棒了，不是其他游戏那种按键式的，而是在视角下方触摸式
"
22877094,"This game is super immersive, and there's nothing else really like it in the store (legend of luca I have not played, but seems to be taking a different path).

For being early access, there's a decent amount of content, and the game is relatively polished. I'm looking forwared to seeing more of this (and I haven't finished it quite yet)."
22875408,"This is a great demonstration of what's possible for VR RPG's. Well worth the $20 price tag, escpecially if they release more content as DLC."
22875175,Amazing. Enjoying this game so much. I'm stumped at the moment to get past the trials at one point.  But this is fantastic. What I'd hoped vr would be.
22875086,"Absolutely excellent! If you love games like Skyrim or old school role-playing you'll love the action-adventure game here.

Can't wait to see future additions."
22874783,"This is the first game I review and first vr game I review. Now most vr games out seem like demos even hover Junkers feels like it's missing something although it great fun. But this game is something else from the movement to the fighting , at one point I smashed a coffin and out game a skeleton demon thing and walked back scarred shitless. No game has had me so involved that I really felt like I was their.  If you have a vibe get this game now."
22873304,"This game is excellent. Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!

One thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times. I play in a 8ft by 10.5ft play area. Many of the other games I've played will utilize the location of the monitor/computer in the room and set the default facing direction as away from the monitor.

The game takes about 2 hours to finish. That said I wouldn't consider the game worth its current price with its currently limited amount of content. To justify the price I believe the final product (after early access ends) should have have at least two or three times as much gameplay as what we can currently enjoy in the first two chapters. I mean paying $10 per hour for first play-through content is a little rediculous. 

I also felt that some of the game's design elements were created to keep the early access beyond Steam's 2 hour refund period. For example time-consuming use of a mining-pick to obtain gold (which is neccessary to proceed), as well as the cryptic hints on how to proceed to the end of each chapter or how to pass through certain doorways."
22872096,"This is it. Of all the VR games I've played so far, this is, by far, the most immersive. I found myself trying to walk out of my play space a dozen times because you *feel* like you're really in the dungeon. Skeletons look like they have mass. They are huge and imposing and you'll block because of your survival instinct.  Don't forget to use your teleport in combat. Dodge those arrows and fireballs. :)"
22871935,Absolutely amazing. I played the whole thing through. Very immersive and for an early access title its polished extremely well. I recommend this game to anyone with a vive. I'm dying for the next chapter to come out. Bravo to the developer.
22871432,"The first VR game to grab me for sure. It has mostly everything you want in this type of game. Though the combat is a bit clunky and could easily be improved with artificial locomotion.

My main complaint, and why I can't recommend this one, is that it's been out for almost a year now, and there really isn't much added content or anything new to do. The content and patches are super slow to release, and for the price tag it's just not worth it. I purchased this expecting the next chapters and now I read that it will be another purchase for the rest of the content. Pass.

6/10 - only buy if you're into very short experiences with not much replay value."
22871258,"Very fun - this is a must pick up game for Vive owners. 
I can see myself replaying the gauntlet for a workout.

Suggestions: 
I would like to see more of an zelda-like dungeon where you need to solve puzzles and get a new weapon to unlock new areas in that dungeon, etc.
I would like to see enemies that only expose a vulnerability to hit after dodging/parying/blocking.
I would like to see enemies where different attacks are needed than thrusting."
22865427,"I don't want to repeat to much here, I agree with all the positives here. I LOVED my experience in this game. Its the first VR game i have played that I had to keep playing until I could not physically play any longer. I'm 50 and not in the best shape, playing this game gave me a work out lol! But in a very satisfying and addicting way.  

My only gripe is that my play space is too small, and im going to fix that asap! Goodbye couch that never gets used, your taking up valuable VR real estate! 

I cant wait for more like this! My advice to the Dev! MORE PLEASE!!!!"
22864300,"Want to feel like you're really in a fantasy or D&D environment? Looking around for that damn archer, then peering round shelter to shoot back? Fighting skeletons and having to actually use swordplay to bypass their shield? This game is for you. Yes it's only a couple of hours long, yes it's what some consider expensive, BUT consider a movie visit. By the time you've gone there, paid for your seat and drinks/food, and sat for a couple of hours, this is no more expensive. The best bit is, YOU are playing the hero, not someone on a screen. Being in the thick of the action, or creeping round the rocks and trees to sudenly get hit by an arrow from an unseen assailant feels so much more real. Looking around you in VR means you can imagine you are really there. 

For me the whole experience was bug free, no slowdowns, judders, or glitches in the scenery. I WILL be buying the next episodes, and hope there are many more to come."
22864015,AMAAAAZING
22861131,"This is currently my favorite game for the Vive. While still a little unpolished here and there (which is completely fair because it's an early-access game) its still a great experience. Recent additions like player profiles also shows that the devs are listening to their customers and working hard to make everything better.

There is currently no game on the Vive that utilizes the technology better.

When the team is finished, I hope you approach Bioware and ask them for permission to make a Mass Effect themed game with the same engine and mechanics. That would be beyond awesome!

This game is a must-have for any Vive owner!"
22857806,Vanishing Realms is the first VR experience that started to feel like a full game. It's a nice glimpse into what adventure games might be like moving forward. It finally pays off those Nintendo Wii promises of weilding a sword and shield. The combat is tense at first but you quickly learn the patterns of when to block and when to get your hits in. It does feel a bit sparse at the moment. The main level took about an hour to get through and the Challenge Mode was about 30 min. Still really good start to a new way to play adventure games.
22856734,"Absolutely superb. While I love my Vive, I was dismayed at the lack of deep gaming experiences - most games are fun arcade games that you get bored of pretty quickly. This game however is exactly the sort of game I could get lost in for hours upon end. It's very immersive, the controls are pretty intuitive, and the fighting is truly awesome. This really shows off the promise of room-scale VR and the medium as a whole like no other game I've played, and is way ahead of its time. If I had to buy one vive VR game, this is the one to purchase. You can fight skeletons with swords and shoot them with a bow and arrow. You search through dungeons gathering loot and solving puzzles. Need I say anymore?"
22855868,Absoultely one of the best games in VR. This game is so immersive. You have done an excellent job. Great game. You have thought of everything in this game and the battles are great.
22855774,This was amazing!
22855663,"I was skeptical at first, but this game was better than I imagined."
22855325,"That was so fun. This was a great first game for me and my Vive. Simple, but polished, and the littlest things, like lighting a candle or blocking the sword stroke of a skeleton were incredibly exciting. If this game were on a flat screen it wouldn't have anything wrong with it but would be totally derivative an not worth mentioning. In VR: One of the most fun games I have ever played."
22854645,"Superb - Best VIVE game out of the 30 or so I have so far.  And I normally do not like RPG's.  REALLY kept my interest. Solutions were not to difficult. At times I thought I'd save and ask for help online, but I thought ""what if... "" and solved them each time.  I've played an hour?  lost track fo time. I'm up on the rocks where the jewled alter is when about 4 archers and some spook that's shooting fireballs. After two deaths - I figured I'd call it a night.   I HAVE SMALL AREA IN THE KICTEN NOOK - about 6ftx 8ft and could still play fine. Though I did SLASH AND HACK the cubboards a few times (The wife said you probably should move all that downstairs. = (
One of top three games for VIVE. Also Xenon (in the Lab) and  A-10 is also a favorite."
22854207,Excellent game. It's a good thing it will autopause if you walk too far from the center because the immersion has me forgetting I'm in a room.
22853217,"Game isn't bad, but they really overused the Bitgem assets.
Combat is not bad, fairly entertaining overall.
Girlfriend hates the game though, already ended up smacking her in the head with a controller 3 times while fighting skeletons."
22851741,"Amazing game in VR, beautiful environments and easy to get lost in. The more real world space you have the better although the teleportation mechanism works well :). Highly recommended!"
22851046,Feels like a VR version of Zelda. Combat is great. Definitely worth the buy.
22850776,"The combat is great fun, the environments are excellent, the whole package for me has been my highlight of VR so far.  It is short, I completed both chapters in 1 hour and 45 minutes worth of play.  However I will play it again and this will be one of the first games I will show anyone new to VR, just because it clearly demonstrates the huge potential for an RPG using VR.

First game where I almost broke something, knocked over a lamp, was surrounded by skeletons.  

Loved this game, I hope the developer produces more."
22849493,"Most amazing experience I've ever had. It's what I've dreamed since I was a kid back on my 486 with a voodoo 3000. I've let a few friends and family members play this and they were blown away.

I hope the dev's continue to add on to the game. I loved it but it was far too short."
22847978,3小时通关，绝对好评，目前最好的VR游戏没有之一，唯一能让你停下虚拟回到现实的原因就是手柄没电，最后看着一帮骷髅军团单膝跪地对我这个被遗忘的贵国王俯首时，我感觉离刀剑神域的世界又近了。不过第二次通关就已经感觉不到任何难度了，2把1000金的剑双刀流虐怪真的太轻松。68元买3小时的失落国度穿越，值！
22844749,"So far the best game I have played on my vive, has more to it that others, (a lot seem like demo's, or very simplistic). I played with slightly smaller area than minimum and is just about doable, but can be annoying/tricky occasionally."
22843861,"做工不错，也不算贵，我给好评。
但我对瞬移机制实在是不感冒，这个游戏再次印证了这一点，所以玩了半小时就
不打算再试，如果你也不喜欢瞬移的话，就不用入了。
"
22840732,Wow.  This is the 1st game that incited me to write a review.  It is very immersive.  I've moved more in the 2 hours that I have played than in the week before I started playing.  I recommend that anyone getting into VR get this game.
22840465,"I beat the first two chapters of this game, and it was an incredible two hours. I had a blast fighting all the creatures, and using the different items. However, the asking price is a bit steep for just two hours of content, I don't think I missed any secrets either. The difficulty is also very easy, I only died once, and that was due to the Inventory system not being great for speed, however, it's a great system none the less."
22838232,"Completed the game in about 3 hours. I must say, this is one of the best, immersive games i've ever played on HTC vive. The melee combat is where the game excels, with sword and shield in both hands.  Ranged attacks (bow/wand) are also very realistic and smooth. The inventory system is organized and unique. I experienced no bugs or glitches during my playthrough. There are 2 chapters, supposedly the 3rd is in development.  I cannot wait for an MMORPG in this sort of gameplay style, as the possibilites would be endless. As for now, this is the developer to watch."
22837414,"Although I haven't completed it yet, I really enjoyed this game. There hasn't been a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or disoriented in the time I have played.

The combat is a little slow paced but I suppose it is for the better after trying other games that had fast paced combat which can make you feel uncomfortable and outright dangerous if designed wrong especially when fights get so intense that you forget about your chaperone bounds.

The cable you are tethered to also hampers your movement so I can't move quickly comfortably because I am always worried about tripping over the wire or smacking into a wall despite the chaperone warning which is often neglected in really heated moments. So I find it good that this game took a slower paced approach.

But the combat was far from snail paced, It was quite entertaining dueling with archers and sword skeletons, trading steel and arrows, dodging and blocking, and taking cover.

The AI though not the smartest in the world somehow seemed to react to my actions, sword fighters sometimes try to pull a fient on you dodging your attacks and swiftly counterattacking for instance. If you try to cheese the game with a bow from a distance eventually your foes start to dodge them.

The foes seem to have a set distance at which they will engage you, the fights are a little slower paced which I don't mind since you have time to plan your next move and don't run out of space as easily.

I found the level design to be nice and clever but far from flawless, there were some places where I felt a disconnect. For instance trying to telport from a ledge to an archer that has been harassing me but it would only allow me to teleport to this one specific little spot on the ground without any visual cues so I was sitting there for ages figuring out how to get there.

I found the inventory system to be quite intuitive, though sometimes it sticks out like a sore thumb when interacting with objects beneath you.

The art style was beautiful despite the simple cartoony looking graphics. Looks pretty good in VR, I loved the god rays coming out of the windows early on in the game. The skyboxes can use some work though.

The puzzles I've encountered so far are nice, but very short and simple.

It is good that the developer added some measures against cheesing the game, like abusing your available space to access areas you should not be able to otherwise.

All in all, I would really recommend this game, it is worth a try even if you don't happen to like RPGs."
22837176,"Wow....what a game! I love it.  If you have a Vive get ready to get a little workout swinging sword, switching to different weapons as fast as possible and enjoy the fun! If you have a Oculus (if this even works with it) then you will just sit on your bum and gain some weight.  The use of the Vive is sweet! this is worth every penny although the graphics aren't superb but good enough.  If you create a good gameplay then graphics are not as important (As the Wii showed us).  Good job!"
22836795,"This was way more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  I was totally sucked into this world, and find myself really looking around and taking everything in.  I also wasn't expecting the skeletons to be so big!  Fighting them is really intimidating.  If this is the future of RPG's in VR, sign me up."
22836127,"I'm having a hard time coming deciding what to say about this game. It's basically Zelda-light in VR. It has so many elements that are really good, but not perfect, though the combination of them in one game is great. 

Swordplay feels fantastic, parrying with a sword is just as fun as you could imagine, and blocking with a shield only to then stab the skeleton in between the armor and the shield like in 300 is crazy fun. 

The loot system where you actually destroy things and then grab the loot is great, the new inventory system (essentially a belt) works pretty well, and is decently unobtrusive. 

The other weapons that I won't spoil are OK, but could be better. The puzzles work pretty well, though the traps, while cool looking, didn't really seem to work for me with teleporting. 

Overall, this is a game with a lot of very cool elements. It makes me more excited for VR's potential than probably any other game I've played. As I said before, nothing is quite perfect... but everything is pretty good. The only real criticism is, of course, the length of the game. My play-time is inflated because 2 people have played it. It is somewhere shy of 2 hours long. It is an early access game, and the dev apparently is planning on adding another chapter. There is no doubt that this is a very cool game, and I don't regret getting it, but it would not be my first purchase."
22836090,"This game is just amazing - don't know where to start. It shows the potential of VR in a very good way without beeing just a ""demo"". You will have fun for several hours and in my opinion it is worth the money."
22836016,"Even though it's in early access, i'm loving this game.
Its the first VR game i've paid for so far, and i'm glad i did.
I'm excited to see what they do in future updates.
Be warned, you are going to sweat... Dont play this if you plan on passing the headset around.."
22831447,"Thoroughly enjoyed this - more Vive games like this would make me very happy. Played through the whole thing in one evening with only a couple of short breaks, so it's a bit short perhaps, but worth the money for sure.

But then a tracking laser broke in one of my base-stations (after just 27 days). I had to argue with an online rep for more than an hour before they agreed to fix it under warranty. And now I've been waiting 9+ days for HTC to arrange a courier to come and pick up the faulty item. Once they've done that, it will apparently be another 10 days before I get it back.

The Vive experience is great. 

HTC support is abysmal - they are slow, unhelpful, and they lie about when things will happen. Think twice before buying early."
22826363,"Wonderful, visceral, and a whole lot of fun. The core concepts are there, and I am excited to see how this genre evolves. If you own a Vive, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
22823772,"Das beste VR-Spiel zur Zeit.

Trotz Early-Access wirkt das Spiel fertiger als viele andere Spiele. Die Steuerung ist einfach nur genial, da können sich manch andere Spiele eine Scheibe von abschneiden.

Mit Schild und Schwert oder Bogen und Pfeil wird der Mann wieder ein Kind. Die Welt ist atmosphärisch animiert und die Physik funktioniert tadellos. 

Was dem Spiel noch fehlt ist Early-Access typisch noch eine vernünftige Storyline. Das Spiel hat das potenzial zum ersten VR-Blockbuster für die HTC-Vive."
22823440,"Vanishing Realms ist das erste 'echte' Roomscale-Spiel dass ich probiert habe.

Man bewegt sich im Dungeon bzw. in der zugehörigen Umgebung, und insbesondere die Innenräume vermitteln den Eindruck von Räumen in denen man sich befindet. Es erinnert an die alten Eye-of-the-Beholder, in denen man sich jetzt mittendrin befindet. Oder ein wenig ein 3d-mittendrin-Zelda.

Die Welt ist nicht riesig, und es geht relativ linear vorwärts . Aber das fällt während dem Spiel nicht weiter auf.
RPG-Teil gibt es quasi keinen, VR ist eher ein Dungeon-Crawler.

Auch wenn es etliche Punkte für 'hier geht noch was' gibt, ist VR eine runde Sache. Durch den Blick auf alte  PC-Titel liegt evtl. die Messlatte auch zu hoch für eine 'neutrale' Betrachtung. Alles in allem ist VR für Freunde von Dungeon-Spielen allemal einen Blick wert, wenn nicht sogar ein MUST-HAVE.

Soweit das 'ursprüngliche' Spiel, Chapter 1.

Das hinzugekommene Chapter 2 besteht leider nur aus einer grafisch netten, aber 'passiven' Burg und einem Kampfstrang, bestehend aus 9 zeitbegrenzten Einzelteilen.

Die Kämpfe und deren Mechanik sind super implementiert, und man geht ganz im Geschehen auf. Die präzise Mechanik im Nahkampf demonstriert eindrucksvoll den Gewinn an Spielqualität mit getrackten Controllern.

Ich hatte allerdings dabei das Problem, dass mein Spielbereich mit 2.5x2.5m zu klein für die Schwertkämpfe ist und ich regelmässig Wände und Einrichtung getroffen habe, trotz dauerhafter Bodenmarkierung und Rücken an der Grenze. Und mit Gegnern von hinten geht selbst das nicht.

Mein Tip: mit weniger als 3m Platz eignet man sich besser von vornherein einen Kampfstiel mit einem Bewegungsradius von Essbesteck an. In Eifer des Gefechts im Ausfallschritt mit gestrecktem Arm den Controller in eine Wand oder teures Mobiliar zu hämmern geht verdammt schnell. Die vielgerühmte Immersion mit Roomscale tut hier perfekt ihren Dienst.

Insgesamt ist das zweite Kapitel nett für einen Durchgang und , aber ich hätte lieber mehr von Art des ersten Kapitels gehabt.

22816514,"One of the best Vive Games at the moment.
Fighting with two swords against skeletons, what could possibly be better in VR? :D

I had absolutely no VR-sickness while playing it.

The last patch fixed a few minor annoyances, so the developer seems to take feedback to heart which is great.
"
22815810,"This is the best VR game I've played so far.  It is unbelievably immerisve.

I was walking across a bridge and actively trying to balance myself so I wouldn't fall off.  I went to eat an apple and starting opening and closing my mouth trying to actually eat.

The game play is great.  I was worried that the point and click move style would ruin it for me, but it totally works.  Combat is a blast, I was actually tired after a sword fight with a skeleton.

I'm blown away by this game, absolute must have for the Vive."
22815780,"Absolutly top game, I love it. Can´t wait for next chapter. Thanks to the devs for this perfect game.

22805514,I can't recommend this game enough.  Really starts to show you what VR can do for a game and how amazingly fluid and flexible the motion controllers can make a game.  If you have a Vive buy this now!
22804742,"This is my first VR game and I bought it based on reviews.  I have to say that it was fun.  Combat was pretty simple, probably too much so.  In further expansions I hope that ranged combat is similar to the AI or atleast more ranged options (spell casting).  Look forward to additional chapters and game play."
22804290,"HOLY. SH!T. That's all I'm going to say. YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS GAME. DO NOT read the negative reviews, VR is in its baby steps. SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS. It's worth EVERY PENNY."
22804157,"Amazing VR experience. The best I had, really. For me, this is what a AAA game should aim for. Exploring dungeons, fighting creatures, and trust me, using you sword and blocking with your shiled is a ton of fun! This game is awesome, can wait to see the final game!"
22802320,"Blocked an arrow from behind, deflected a sword hit, jumped up and stabbed a skeleton in the neck like MF Brad Pitt in Troy.

22802178,This was my first intro to VR game.  I stood in the entry room just looking up/around for a few very amazing moments.  The developers did such a fantastic job.    You can easily get lost in the world they created.    I just finished the second level and I have to say this really was a lot of fun.  I do hope to see more content.  I really enjoyed playing through it.
22801184,"My favourite experience on the Vive, so far. This game takes VR to the next level. I've owned the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2, and just got the Vive today. I was totally unprepared for how immersive this game would be. 

There are different weapons to purchase, loot hidden all over the place, real physical combat including dodging, blocking, and landing blows. All of this is handled via the motion controllers, and it's implemented very well. 

The environments are beautiful, the enemies have personality and artistic beauty, the sound is good. It's a really REALLY good VR experience.

If you're a Vive owner, you'll be doing yourself a favour with this game."
22798271,"just got my vive and THIS IS THE GAME TO PLAY... 
For staters the way you move around the map is brilliant a combination of room scale and warp jumping as a result my family and I have never suffered from vr-sickness.
The fighting in the game is realy good and has a naturel feel to it so even my wife can do it (she hates games) and gets the adrenalin pumping very fast.The enemies are a chalange to kill but could use a bit more AI power.
This game also looks amazing with good map layouts and puzzles of which i hope get harder to do/work out and the only thing missing is a small minimap to help show were you have been.

the only negetive we have is the health and inventory when we looked down were a little blurry to read sometimes  (that could be down to the fit of the vive) and that the bags dissapered when we were crouching on the floor to pick food up.

We cannot wait for more levels to be added and for the game to get a liilte bit more polished."
22798071,Hands down the best vr game ive played thus far. Combat is insanely fun and the entire game has me smiling. This is a world i could get lost in.
22796763,"Vanishing Realms is fantastic; even moreso after their recent update. 

The refined combat, addition of multiple saves, and inventory changes takes this game from a 7/10 to a 9/10. 

Own a Vive? This game is a must-have."
22795156,"Fantastic game which really shows off the Vive at its finest.

Apart from the fact that its short (about 2 hours worth of content at the moment), it is very hard to fault. In fact I would rate this as one of my two favourite Vive games (the other is Holopoint) and dont ask me to pick between them because I wont."
22794272,Very good game to start with the VR fun to play and really good ramp up in difficulty
22793164,"My favorite Vive game so far. 
Very visceral and engaging combat. Great riddles too. 
I can't wait for additional chapters!"
22791511,Sehr schönes spiel. Bitte mehr davon ^^ Great game Thanks
22784901,"Game length is a bit short, completeled it in about 2 hours, but had a lot of fun playing it!"
22782742,"I just finished playing it now. This is my BEST VR gaming experience yet. I absolutely LOVED it! To think that only ONE guy made it is incredible. Now it IS kind of short, but well worth it. Buy this game. You won't regret it.

10/10. I'd happily sword fight three skeletons simultaneously again."
22781671,One of the good ones! Just buy it! :)
22778118,"Eine Art Offline-WOW aus der Ich-Perspektive. Die Schwertkämpfe wirken noch ein wenig unausgefeilt, aber das Spiel ist trotz der Comicgrafik richtig schön umgesetzt & sehr immersiv!"
22772746,"I love Vanishing Realms, except for th- [AUTO PAUSE ENABLED.  STAND IN THE CENTER OF THE PLAY AREA AND THEN HIT RESUME].  That, I can't stand how frequen- [AUTO PAUSE ENABLED.  STAND IN THE CENTER OF THE PLAY AREA AND THEN HIT RESUME].  ARRRGH!  Talk about taking you STRAIGHT out of the ex-[AUTO PAUSE ENABLED.  STAND IN THE CENTER OF THE PLAY AREA AND THEN HIT RESUME]"
22770453,"Best VR Game i played so far!!!

Bestes VR Game was ich bis jetzt gespielt hab!!!"
22763376,"i have never left reviews on steam before i only got my htc vive last thursday only played a few minutes so far but i will be putting alot more time into this game this week one thing i would like to see added to the game is when you go up to the scrolls and read the scrolls or books it would be cool if there was some voice acting like some one starts reading the scrolls to you when you aproach the scrolls 

will add more to this later after i have put more time into the game so far i think it is a really good game for early access if you have a vive i would recommend you buy this game  :)"
22761372,"solid peek into dungen crawling VR potential. not a flawless game, glitches here and there, but they make up for it easily! also the update is solid! im glad to see more being added, and i cant wait to play more. this feels like part 1 of a much deeper game!"
22759877,Vous avez un casque de réalité virtuelle ? Ce jeu est un must have ! Même s'il est encore accès anticipé c'est une tuerie ! Vivement les prochains chapitres !
22755581,"I cowered with a shield protecting my body, then I jumped and landed a killing blow."
22753258,"Ok, so I thought I'd try it just to check it & do a real playthrough later.
1.3 hours after that, my heels hurt, forget bedtime, I only stopped because one of my controllers gave up..."
22752627,Makes me feel like a little kid again. The immersion is spot on and will have you checking every corner. A must have VR title!
22750959,"Pretty awesome VR game, the combat could use a bit of work (feels a bit Wii-like), could use some more RPG elements and it's definitely pretty short (I've already beaten it), but overall it's great and impressive one guy made this."
22749646,"Oh wow. This is by far my favourite VR game of the 10 I have tried so far. Really immersive, and lots of fun.

Really plays to the strength of the platform, with the game paced and arranged sensibly to match what works well with VR. Its amazing how terrifying a cartooney monster can be when its life sized standing in front of you swinging its sword at you!

One nice thing which I hope other developers pick up on is when you are teleporting around it doesnt ever change which way you are facing, it only moves you. This is FAR better and makes it a lot less disorientating, less sickening, and doesn't break the immersion so much.
"
22749551,"Il est très difficile de noter un jeu de ce type, mon avis est mitigé, mais le résultat est sans appel : c'est la première fois que je demande à me faire rembourser un jeu sur Steam.
Alors oui l'univers est assez bien modélisé, c'eet sympa de vraiment taper avec une épée comme on le ferait en vrai, mais le jeu a pour moi deux défauts majeurs : 
- la téléportation
- l'absence de scénario

Pour la téléportation beaucoup diront que c'est le choix majoritairement retenu par les développeurs. Alors oui dans un Budget Cuts ou un The Lab ça fonctionne sans soucis c'est vrai. Mais Budget Cuts étant un jeu d'infiltration on ne peut pas abuser de ce déplacement et TheLab... ça n'est pas vraiment un jeu. Ici on se retrouve à ,pouvoir traverser toute la map en restant debout sans même faire un pas, en passant au milieu de tous les pièges en parcourant des kilomètres en quelques secondes !! Du grand n'importe quoi. AU minimum aurait-il fallu mettre en place un système de stamina pour éviter de pouvoir cliquer à gogo, pouvoir fuire les combats (les ennemis n'essaynt mlême pas de vous poursuivre) sans craintes. Ce style de jeu doit trouver une autres mécanique que celle-là.

Pour le scénario (alors bon je ne suis pas bilingue et des détails m'ont échapper à la lecture des parchemins en ""intro"") il est quasi inexistant :( pour un RPG c'est vraiment dommage quand même. Il y a un embryon de scénario mais rien de convainquant.

Alors oui, le jeu est hyper immersif, c'est jouissif (les premières minutes) de se balader dans cet univers en marchant, mais franchement c'est plus une démo technique qu'un vrai jeu et en plus je ne suis pas convaincu.

Le jeu a du potentiel mais doit fortement évoluer pour avoir un pouce en l'air."
22748311,"Wow. Have only played 20 minutes on this game, but this is what I was always looking for in VR. Think Zelda in style, going around collecting gems and loot with a flame torch in one hand and a sword in the other

The teleport system that is being used with VR seems solid... but with games like this, that looks so convincing in VR, I just want to walk and walk and walk. It would be cool to see some kind of game design that employs Unseen Diplomacy’s technique of room control. Anyway, that is more a criticism of how unbelievably convincing VR is, and how much of a shame it is when you see the Chaperone Boundaries come up.
If you are new to the Vive, buy this now. Best game I have played on it yet, and actually feels like a game rather than a tech demo.

EDIT:

Chapter 2 is dreadful... it really left a sour taste in my mouth to the entire experience. Gone is the wonderful RPG exploration with puzzles, in is a battle area with time limit. It feels like the poorest excuse of level padding and it really wasn't fun. When it gets to the end, I wasn't even sure it was the end and wasted lots of time trying to find out what I have to do next. I really want to see the dev change this, otherwise this review will turn to negative once the game leaves EA.

EDIT 2 (in Progress

The update has made the combat much much harder and much more fun. Unfortuatly you can beat the game by crouching (the AI can't cope with it). Vast improvement in smashable objects and little puzzles (such as throwing rocks to knock down goblets etc). This update puts me back in positive mind set about the Developer, although I am not looking forward to ""chapter 2""... hopefully it has also been updated in a good direction.

If you have already played this game before the update, get stuck back in right now!"
22748209,Best VR game sor far.
22746475,"Fantastic game, everything you want in a VR title. The dungeoneering is spectacular, making it feel like you are really there. A couple of times I almost ran into a wall instead of moving with the pad I was so immersed. The combat was exactly what I had hoped for, blocking attacks with your shield, curving a blade around a skeletons armor, and diving sideways to evade arrows. There was a point when I was surrounded by skeletons catching minor movements out of the corner of my eye only to block a strike that might have killed me. 

This game was far too enjoyable to put into words, the only way to convey the greatness of Vanishing Realms is to play it yourself."
22743517,"Love the game so far!  Great immersion, artwork and game mechanics.  Can't wait to see where the game goes as it progresses."
22742093,"So far, the best game I have played on Vive. Uses the device to the full, and emerses you effortlessly in the world it presents.

I definitely want to see more games like this, and can't wait to see how such things evolve over time. Highly recommended.

Update: I've seen a lot of (to be honest, expected) recent reviews complain about the DLC being paid. I can understand this complaint, as the original game was Early Access and was also pretty short for the cost of the game. I don't think that the developer is being ""greedy"" as some suggest, but I do think it is a major mistake to charge for what is essentially the remainder of the base game.

A somewhat foolish PR mistake for sure - but it doesn't change the fact that this is still one of my favourite VR experiences to date. It is also true, though, that Karnage Chronicles might be a better alternative if you don't already have the base Vanishing Realms.

Seems to me a Steam sale at 50% plus the DLC for free for the first few weeks would have done a better job at onboading new players (and raising more cash), without unduly annoying original supporters of this game.

All of that said, I still recommend this game, as it is a lot of fun and a great introduction to the potential of VR."
22740501,"VR ARPG的尝试之作，剧情流程不长，但可以初步体验在VR里亲手砍怪的感觉。
也许是为了照顾玩家都是初入VR，怪物的AI不高，大多数怪不会主动追击，让玩家可以慢慢练习砍怪。后面出现会追击玩家的怪物后，难度就突然提升了。"
22737618,"Man. This game is so immersive it had me grinning like a kid. I don't know how long the game is but I played for 3 hours straight tonight. I love being able to block an incoming swing or arrow with a shied. You can even block with your sword too! I like being able to peek around the corner and let loose with my arrow.
And sometime I just have to stop and take in the world around me. So very fun."
22736176,"This game is excellent. Play it.
I haven't played the latest update, which sounds like it addressed all of the minor issues I had:
1. Teleportation, one of the better implementations, but still awkardly found myself at the front of my room too much.
2. AI doesn't come at you, so you can game it pretty easily. 
3. Sword physics, you can just wobble and poke at the enemy for best effect.

Play this game."
22734709,"This is simply the best game out there period.
No other game puts you right into the world and makes you feel part of it. 
If you ever wanted to truly feel like you are playing inside a game world, Vanishing Realms sets the gold standard. 
The inventory system is pure genius and so intuitive. 
I cant wait for the next installment."
22734636,"Very cool RPG, though (as others have said) a little short. It took me about 2 hours to complete the first time. It will be great once more content is added.
Apparently several new features were added just before I bought it. I can't compare to what is was before, but the combat is pretty good, the inventory was very well managed, and the teleportation movement did not give me virtigo."
22734544,"Really cool start to what I'm sure will become a big genre in VR. Closest thing to a Zelda type game currently.

That said, only buy if you are willing to invest in a shorter experience. It's good, but has as much enemy variety as I have fingers on my hand."
22731206,Took me just over an hour and a half to beat. Can't wait for more!
22728797,"Oh my god. I think there is no way to describe this experience with words.
The single most amazing and immersing game experience ever.
Fighting a 2 meter skeleton...oh boy that's intense!
You can actually duck and take cover from arrows, shoot around corners etc.
Keep going developing such games to evolve VR!

Only thing I am missing is a level system (experience). So far I could only collect gold.
"
22727894,"An enjoyable title with a good sense of presense and a keen graphical polish but with a questionable price versus time ratio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eEvUlq4Bd4"
22727252,The best VR experience for the HTC Vive at this moment. Pretty incredible what this developer managed to pull off on his own. Very entertaining!
22724906,"Fantastic and immersive game! Especially the ending O.o

Looking forward to continuing the story :D"
22723654,"遊戲畫面很精緻,開始的教學關卡也設計得不錯,讓玩家容易上手
遊戲中很多互動的細節也做得很好,操作很便利
因為遊戲中常需要到處撿拾道具 需要稍大些的空間會比較好進行
才不會因為牆壁常出現而被暫停遊戲
"
22723502,"Quick version: best experience in VR so far, a must buy. Would bust my ceiling lamp again 11/10

However it's not perfect. Way too short, and because of that it's too expensive. Also, it's way too easy (because of poor AI). That being said, if you own a VIVE and want to get a taste for a what a great game could and will be, this is the game to own at the moment.

"
22721576,"Awesome, now make an mmo :-)"
22718754,"I'm not writing much reviews here on Steam. But this game is worth it's price. More than that. It's really, really good. And by far the best game for VR right now. Well done Mr. Kelly Bailey - this game is immersive. You can be proud and you've done a good job."
22718261,"Wow. All I can say is wow. Best. Experience. On Vive. If you like games like Legend of Zelda, Skyrim, or any high fantasy type property, you simply must own this game. You actually get to fight with sword and shield! It is incredibly fun to actually FIGHT, rather than ""press a button to swing your sword. Press another button to raise your shield. Yay."" kind of abstract gameplay that has been the best any computer or console could do up until now. Carefully swinging your sword and maneuvering it through your enemy's armor to get a hit to the vulnerable vitals within never, ever gets old, and the satisfaction of actually being the victor in combat is greater here than any game I've ever played in my life.

The best complement I can pay it is that I would LOVE for the game to be as big as Skyrim, and take me hundreds of hours to beat. I would never, ever get tired of it! Own a Vive? You MUST own this game.

And to the dev, hurry up! I wanna play more! XD
(Oh, and you ROCK.)

Ben"
22717508,"OK...hands down, if you want the tl;dr-- ""This is one of THE games to buy for the Vive. It is a must-play. It is not even finished and it is already completely amazing, worth the price it is charging and definitely a go-to demo for the true power of VR as a medium for storytelling and compelling gameplay. Get off the fence, come down here and buy this.""

This is no tech demo and you can't even get a slight idea of what its like from the pictures and teaser video... this is meat on the bone single-player mystery/puzzle/action RPG. Its duration is short at the moment compared to AAA titles, but it is early access and still well worth the price. This game has the perfect all-around mix of mechanics, story, artistic flare and mystery to bring you fully into another world. The words to describe the experience would be things like, stupendous, rewarding, enthralling, memorable, thought-provoking. 

I've played games like this before...and from an abstracted point of view, everything in Vanishing Realms has been done before, but you've NEVER done what you do in Vanishing Realms. If you played Spell Fighter-- that was a taste, but this is the whole bite. It has the hallmarks of a good RPG game but this time YOU do it for real. Every sword swing is your own. You can cast magic and its not some autotargeting system..if you don't point your wand correctly your spell will fly off and sputter doing nothing. When you pull the bowstring on your bow and let it go...you better aim true. 

You'll find yourself crouching or sitting down after a battle, panting while you put virtual food to your face to gain health and mana. 
You'll be dueling mortal combat with larger-than-life monsters, trading blows, parrying and ducking around your playspace to dodge. 
You'll curse and swear and fight with all your strength as you realize monsters don't play fair, or wait in line to kill you.
You'll hide behind a virtual rock for cover as a wizard casts wicked magic your way.
You'll parry arrow shots inches from your body with expert timing using just your sword. 
You'll search every nook and cranny for secrets, hidden loot, questionable keys and forgotten treasures. 

You'll be completely blown away by this game."
22717209,"This is a really fun hack 'n slash dungeon crawler -- made for VR. Absolutely worth the cost for what you get. To the people reading this review, please support this developer -- we need more levels/content. Imagine this in multi-player? 

To the developer -- I found that the hovering enemy health bars kind of detracted from the immersion, I wonder if there is a better way to represent enemies health?"
22716453,"这效果不要太棒，简直停不下来啊。看我砍砍砍……
目前只有第一章，期待日后的表现

可惜没有中文，VR里面又没有方便地查单词的方法。"
22709160,很有趣 只是房間真的不能太小
22708319,"It uses a lot of premade assets and the world does feel somewhat static, but everything is very well put together and the artstyle even with the assets feels cohesive. Also this is probably the first VR game where you can actually explore a dungeon, with treasures and monsters!"
22703255,"Awesome experience.

Wondeful swordplay.

Though I would have liked some extra challenge modes, with some kind of procedural level generation for longevity."
22700545,"Wow ... is all I can say. Vanishing Realms is the reason I'm hyped for VR and the future of gaming. I bought the Vive and tried out games like Space Pirate Trainer and Audioshield and was very impressed. Then I bought Vanishing Realms and was completely blown away. 

It really does remind me of my early days of dungeon crawling in Elder Scrolls: Arena. I take it back that far because I know this is the beginning of VR gaming and Arena introduced me to dungeon crawling / RPGs along with Betrayal at Krondor and the like. 

Vanishing Realms is an awesome, colorful, immersive and totally amazing game and I really hope we continue to see more out of not only this game, but others like it that build on this style of VR play. I know Oculus Touch is coming, but being able to experience this game in room-scale VR on the Vive confirmed my choice of headset so much so that I canceled my Rift order."
22699355,"While my review was initially very positive it has just recently passed two years of development with just about no healthy updates outside of bug fixes, locomotion changes, etc.

I understand taking time to flesh out a game ensuring polish and quality along the way, but this game was supposed to get several acts added over the years and so far the best we have seen really was an arena and quality of life updates.

Looking at January's update, the latest update as of this review, we can see:
- Steam Achievements
- Faster Glide speed
- No joystick click for oculus touch
- Smarter oculus touch sensing
- New language support

And now keep in mind this was the first update since September of 2017, the 2nd latest update was in September of 2016 with a roadmap.

The 2017 update, the only one in 2017, stated DLC to come. Sure it's in EA and he's already talking about paid DLC, apparently, but I understand it's an expensive process to make a game so whatever. Now it has been a while since then and still no news outside of the January update. No new content, no notifications on what he's doing, etc.

If the game were taken of Early Access I think I would be fine and accept it for what it is. But knowing I bought the game with so many promises up in the air and having two years pass since then has me kind of disappointed at best.

The game itself is very polished and fun, but I think we have reached the point were we have many options of games to play in VR so maybe look elsewhere first before coming here."
22699352,"Vanishing Realms isn't finished, but what's there right now is tons of fun. The motion controls fail every now and then, resulting in your sword just whiffing through an enemy, but the rest of the time when they do work it's loads of fun parrying attacks and deflecting arrows by doing more than just the waggling we've long associated ""motion control sword fighting"" with. It's not perfect - the bow and arrow, while functional, isn't really as fun to use as the ones in The Lab or Spellfighter because the arrow is automatically straighened instead of angling as you move your hand, and the inventory belt can be hard to use to grab a potion in the middle of a fight because it seems to rotate based on where you're positioned, but Vanishing Realms is still a lot of fun and one of my favorite VR games."
22691217,"Très bon jeux en accès anticipé, vivement la suite !!! 
Les graphismes rende bien, le niveau de présence est vraiment bon, quelque petite énigme ou action sympa 
Les contrôles le roomscale est les déplacements pas téléportation sont très agréables, les combats sont excellent beaucoup de fun la monté en puissance de l'équipement apporte un vrai plus, le plaisir de la découverte est forte, tellement que le jeux est frustrant a l'heure actuelle car beaucoup trop court, à essayé absolument pour tout fan de zelda et autres rpg, immersion garantie !!!"
22684994,"Vanishing Realms ist mein erstes Spiel, welches ich mir für die Vive dazu gekauft habe. Bei der allgemeinen Preisbalance wo die VR Spiele liegen, hab ich lange hin und her überlegt. Mein alltime Fav. Game ist Dark Souls. Also wollte ich etwas zum erkunden, sowie ein brauchbares Kampfsystem. Vanishing Realms bietet sowas im kleinen. Das Kampfsystem KANN ordentlich genutzt werden, aber auch ein rumgefuchtel wie bei Wii-Titel führt zum Erfolgt und erledigten Gegner. Ich rate für die Immersion trotzdem ordentlich zu spielen, was den Spielspaß erhöht. Das Erkunden ist beim erstmal richtig richtig klasse, flacht aber beim erneuten Spielen schneller ab. Da nichts random platziert wird. Aber das ist okay, würde man jedem anderen Single-Playertitel auch nicht ankreiden. Jedoch wirkt ein erneuter Durchlauf, weniger spannend. Daher sei dies angemerkt.
Der WoW-Look ist gut gewählt bei der momentanen Performance situation. Es verbreitet Stimmung, aber keine Panik beim erkunden der Gemäuer. Ein kleiner Jumpscare zum Anfang. Der aber wirklich nicht der rede wert ist ist auch dabei. Ich liebe Horrorfilme sowie Spiele, und das genannte Dark Souls hat natürlich auch viele solcher verstörenden Elemente. Jedoch wirkt in VR so etwas immer noch eine Ecke krasser und Intensiver. Daher bin ich froh, dass dieses Game nie zu dunkel oder zu furchteinflössend daher kommt. Es macht Spaß, sich eine Fackel zu greifen und hier und da ein bisschen Indiana Jones art die Gänge zu beleuchten, auch wenn dies nie notwendig ist. Da alles hell genug bleibt. Man macht es trotzdem und man fühlt sich wieder ein paar Jahre jünger und baut sich ein Spiel im Spiel damit. 

Ich habe zu diesem Zeitpunkt den ersten Akt in gut einer Stunde durchgespielt. Was auch wirklich mein persönliches Limit war. 
- Das Erkunden (soweit möglich von meinem Wohnzimmer), funktioniert mit RoomSkaling und blinking bzw. teleportieren zu neuen Abschnitten kombiniert wirklich gut. Auch rückwärts, um sich platz zu schaffen, wenn Gegner vor einem stehen. Macht man dies zuu schnell verspürt man gerade gegen Ende ein wenig Übelkeit. Aber alles im Rahmen und verglichen mit dem, was ich mit dem Dev-Kit1 der OR damals durchgemacht habe. Ein Kinderspiel. Man ertappt sich dabei, wie man hier und dort unter Möbeln schaut und jede Ecke untersuchen möchte. Ob nicht doch noch irgendwo etwas versteckt ist.
- Das Kämpfen funktioniert wie schon gesagt gut, kann aber auch in fuchtellei ausatmen. Gerade wenn man seine persönliche Pause machen will, bzw. einfach nur noch den Akt beenden will, weil man erschöpft ist. Die KI ist wirklich nicht der rede Wert, die Skelette fuchteln ein wenig, schreien dich an (perfekter Zeitpunkt um ins Auge zu stechen) und schwingen ihr Schwert aus 2 Richtungen. Ansonsten bleiben sie hinter ihren Schild und warten eher das man auf sie zu kommt. Was gut ist. Denn in VR wird vieles schnell hektisch: ""Wo bin ich gerade im RL? Hoffentlich ist vor mir nicht der Fernsehr, kurz umschalten zur Kamera. Neu Positionieren. Kabel richten. Okay weiter gehts!"" Solche Momente wird man hier alle 2 min erleben, gerade wenn man nur etwa 3x2 Meter platz hat. Ich habe fast meine Freundin aufm Sofa einmal getroffen. Gerade wenn man voll dabei ist. Oder nur ein paar Münzen sammeln will. Daher ist es gut, dass die Gegner eher passiv agieren und dem Spieler sehr viele Chancen bieten. Ich denke das ist ein guter Kompromiss, zwischen Spielspaß und Sicherheit.
- Die Technik dahinter. Ich mag mich täuschen, aber ich glaube vieles ist Asset, was im Unitystore angeboten wird. Aber das macht mir nichts. Man muss den WoWartigen Look aber mögen. Dafür bleibt die Performance auch meist Stabil. Bei zu vielen Lichtquellen hatte ich hier und da ein zucken gesehen. Was aber auch an meiner 770 GTX (4gb vram) liegen kann. Die Eingaben funktionieren tadellos und man merkt, dass sich viele Gedanken gemacht wurden. Einzig das man nicht runterfallen kann, wenn man sich auf Kisten portet finde ich etwas schade. Aber eine Kleinigkeit. Was mich mehr stört ist das Speichersystem, was eher Checkpointartig funktioniert. Ich hatte mal einen Soundausfall und wollte Steam neu starten und stand wieder vor New Game. Tut nicht not. 


Unterm Strich möchte ich Jedem Vanishing Realms empfehlen, der einmal als Ritter Dungeons erkunden möchte. Die Spielzeit mag (momentan) kurz wirken und der Wiederspielwert gen Null. Jedoch muss man sich vor Augen führen, dass VR nach einer Stunde schon anstrengend ist. Ich denke Sessions werden niemals 4-6 Stunden in Angriff nehmen. Zumindest wenn man so aktiv agiert wie hier. Und auch wenn man nach einem mal Spielen alles gesehen hat, denke ich schaut man vielleicht hin und wieder noch mal rein, um ein paar Monster zu metzeln. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. Ich bin gespannt ob und was noch alles nachgeliefert wird. Aber es fühlt sich jetzt schon wie ein richtiges Spiel an, was das wichtigste erfüllt. Es macht Spaß!"
22681233,"I think this may be my first review (just saw I also reviewed Orion Prelude....ha).  There's so many things I want to say about this game.  For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game.  I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer’s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything.

When I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game.  When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game.  Heck, when I read books...I wanted them to be this game.  This game is not Morrowind or Diablo.  It's not any of those things.  This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic. 

It has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game.  Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization.  This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG.  But it doesn't matter.  We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one.  This is as close as you can get right now.

My only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short.

Remember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote?  Remember when you bought a Playstation move and for a few hours thought it was awesome until you realized that, meh, not that great?  Remember when you wanted to be playing this game?  Well, lucky for you, this is that game.

Buy it, support it, and get on the Dev's nerves about making it better and better.  I love this game.

22669805,One of the best VR games I have tried on the Vive.
22668267,"To the developer: Please add respawning mobs.  Like add a slider somewhere that lets you determine how fast mobs respawn.  Teleporting around a level looking for stuff will get people motion sick if it's not broken up with some combat here and there.  What would be EVEN BETTER, would be something like a marathon mode where you fight mobs back to back without having to worry about plot.  Maybe have a linear progression so you're not constantly moving up and down platforms.  The platforms make for a better story-mode, but you can get VR sick if you're spending 3+ hours going up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down."
22667897,"I really enjoyed it, altho the dark settings and cartoony graphics sometimes acdentuated the current shortcomings of the vr headset(s).
I hope we will get a bit more difficult puzzels in the future as the same monsters over and over can get repetitive.
All in all had fun, and totaly worth the price."
22667282,"Macht super viel Spaß, obwohl sehr einfach aussieht. Die Gegner KI ist vielleicht manchmal etwas seltsam. Aber dadurch auch nicht unfair"
22665367,"After watching a few friends try this ( before me!) on my new Vive, I eventually played it through from start to finish over a couple of hours today.

It is the best VR experience I've had so far! It is amazing and will leave you in awe after the the first corridor. This game is absolutely worth the price and it shows what can be done with VR. The potential to play with friends in an online dungeon crawl with these mechanics would be amazing.

Although the fighting mechanics are a little basic, it is exciting and engaging. Wait until you try the wand..omg. There were a few times when I actually raised my sword to the sky after the end of stages etc :)

Oh..I also wanted to add that I pulled out the headphones a couple of times and got tangled with the cable. Not an issue with the game, moreso the Vive. Wireless headphones have got to be the next thing on my list ;)"
22661949,"The enviroments are beautiful but the actual combat and movement feels really bad. This one's kind of a letdown, honestly. Only lasts about two hours too.

ONE YEAR LATER EDIT:
The combat barely feels better but is still pretty shit.
There's been basically no actual content updates besides a hard mode that just gives the enemies more damage and health but otherwise changes nothing.
It's also still entirely based on teleporting.

Yeah no. Still bad."
22659141,"I haven't played much, but I can already say that it's easily worth the $20 for a fully featured dungeon crawler. The combat is simple enough to get a hang of but not without some strategy. Using different strikes with your sword and choosing between dual-wielding or sword and shield are among the multiples choices you'll have to make. Sword play is satisfying. Bow shooting is fun. Dragon wand is your win button.

I'm working with a 2m x 2m play space, and while the combat can get a bit claustrophobic, the teleport feature can be used to great effect. Get too close in a fight? Point the controller behind you and teleport backwards! 

Visually it's a really charming toon art style a la Torchlight or WoW. The story doesn't stray too far from classic dungeon lore, but that's a good thing. This game gets dungeone crawled and VR right. I can't wait for future updates, and if the developer ever figures out a multiplayer implementation (maybe a PvE arena setting??), this will be the RPG to beat for years."
22657656,"Edit: Developer is listening to customer feedback. With the release of the current patch, the clunky inventory and melee weapon abuse has been fixed!

One of the best games I've played in VR. This does not feel like just a tech demo. On the get go you are totally immersed in the world and get right into exploring.

There are problems with it however (Clunky inventory system, Ability to abuse teleport/flailing weapons, no true story), but there is definet potential here for something truly amazing."
22657560,"It's better than it looks in the screenshots. There are more enemy types than what is shown in the screenshots & video, and you also have ranged combat options in addition to sword and board. Travel beyond your chaperone area is done via short range ""blink"" type teleportation that works fine. There are occasional elements that leverage room-scale quite well, at one point I actually got on my hands and knees to get past a certain hazard & grab some treasure. The combat is a bit sloppy, but it's satisfying. At this point the inventory system isn't great, but the dev has posted indication that he has an improvement pending in the next patch. 

I recommend putting on some soft, 1 to 5 pound wrist weights to improve the feeling you get when playing."
22657495,"Early Access Watcher Reviews Vanishing Realms: Rite of Steel for HTC Vive

Update Version: Initial Release

Disclosure: The game copy was bought by the reviewer.

Before going into this review, it might be a good idea to hold a disclaimer over the rest of the talking points. I tested this game sitting down in a office desk chair and had to use my upper body to move. This game thankfully allows movement using the controller, teleporting you from one spot on the floor to another. You will need to have the HTC Vive in Room scaling mode to play this game and it was a bit of a challenge to play sitting down, but I will assure all the talking points will cover the universal approach and in no way will my reliability of a chair affect the opinion. That said, let us get to the main question. Is this RPG the grand attraction suited to introduce the functionality of the HTC Vive or is it another newcomer that might have gone on stage prematurely?

The dungeon and graveyard look astounding with a style similar to one of the latter Zelda games. Little cracks cover the walls and the wood bearings show off wear and tare. Skeletons are detailed beautifully with shields riddled with arrows and bruised dents in their armour. It really stood out the entire time I was playing it and I found myself more than once stopping to enjoy the atmosphere. It works very well to establish the mood, even if the actual inhabitants look more cartoonish than frightening. The music was a side note, painfully masked by the louder ambient noises of box hits, enemy strikes and arrow flings. I tried finding a way to change the volume, but I might have missed it. 

The tutorial is a welcome feature and covers the basics such as moving and picking up items. The rest of the features are rather self explanatory except for maybe the wand usage which as of now can be annoying when you attempt to put it away only to blast yourself with it. Items range from health potions, torches, a pick axe, food and puzzle items. Gold, jewels, mana stones, ore (from mining) and chalices add to the currency system used to buy weapons and potions. There are also ruby chalices hidden throughout the dungeon to collect for an achievement, but it also provides gold and mana. It is simple enough to pick up items and the only issues with it are being close enough to reach, but with the teleport movement style I have not had an issue reaching anything. UI consists of slots that appear around your waist and include categories for weapons, potions, wand, bow and items. The item slot is a bit annoying when trying to grab certain items (have to go through each item until you get the one you need) and you cannot drop items. There is a limit to how many items you can carry so unless you stockpiled on fruits before grabbing the pick axe, you should be fine.

Combat is a typical hack and slash standoff against skeletons and ghosts. As long as the enemy can see you and are in range, they will attempt to hit you as a group (space must be available to accommodate multiple melee so bottlenecking into a short gap is usually recommended). Weapons and a shield are either bought or found and weapons range from swords, bows (use off hand to pull back arrow), hammer or a wand (uses mana and you point, hold trigger and release). Dual wielding is possible as well as parrying to deal with melee hits, but the shield is crucial against arrows and moving is the only way to avoid fireballs. It is very simplistic in nature with the majority just being massive flailing of the controller, but it is recommended to time attacks and use movement to gain a upper hand. It can get very tiring during the fights later on. Death is not to harsh on the player at least. 

The look and feel of the game cannot overcome the barren amount of content though. Going through the first level can take about 30-45 minutes if you are going slow and the arena style matches can keep that stretched to about an hour and fifteen. There is a total of 11 ruby chalices to collect and 33 ore spots to harvest for achievements, but all of this can be done in one pass if you look half-effort. It can be hard for some to make it the whole way in one play through with the forty plus monsters you so thankfully their is checkpoint saving, but if someone wants to play, they either start where you left off or erase the entire save and start from the beginning. Outside of this, there were some random moments I experienced missing frames and was kicked out of the game to the Vive menu (it started were I left off when I entered the app again). 

During my second play through, the game starting feeling like an endurance test over anything else. The simple wonder of discovering what was behind the next corner really helped keep the magic alive during the first play through. I still enjoyed the scenery, but when I already knew what to expect it just felt boring. With only about an hour of gameplay and little replay value, it is hard to recommend when other products have so much more meat on their bones. I am eager to see what happens next, but for now it would be better to wait until a few more chapters at least justify the entry price.

Pros

- Beautiful aesthetic
- Fluid controls and combat feedback

Cons

- Very little content 
- Frame issues
- Couple of UI issues (item sorting/selection, miss fires with wand)"
22655921,"This game is totally awesome.  I always dreamed of exploring a dungeon and fighting mythical monsters, and this game delivers.  I truely hope this game sets the bar for other famtasy and Sci-fi RPG's - it's just a ton of fun to play."
22655908,"This is an incredible first attempt at an action RPG on the VIVE.  The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat. 

The melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion. 

The game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.  

8/10 for now.  With more chapters and sword vibrations this could easily become a 9 or even 10/10.  

(seriously drinking potions? So badass.)"
22653798,"Das Spiel macht richtig Laune.

22637667,"The idea was interesting. But that's it. 
30min to finish the chapter 1, without even one challenging moment.

22629950,"VR done well, This game introduces players to a world that while a bit static, feels good and has character.
I like the combat, both sword fighting, bow shooting, and the magic.

I think the enemies are a bit simple and again, most things are static, but when something does shift of move its a wonderful treat.

Its long enough to make it worth the purchase price, and the game is very polished, the UI for inventory is well thought out and there is NO motion sickness at any point.

I am looking forward to the next release, I hope they make more particle effects, swaying trees, a day and night cycle, and mobs that are a little more reactive and intellegent, but for now this has been one of the best VR games i have played."
22627084,"Leute, was für eine Erfahrung ... Ich war ja schon immer ein RPG Fan, aber welche Art von RPGs möglich sind in VR hat mich echt weggeblasen. 
Die ganzen VR Komponenten finde ich hier einfach super durchdacht: Ich habe einen virtuellen Gürtel um die Taille, der alle Waffen, Tränke, Zauber und sonstigen Gegenstände aufbewahrt, daher kann ich auch ein relativ komplexes Inventar recht schnell verwalten - Das Winzige, was ich mir wünschen würde, wäre eine Art Oberfläche, in der ich meinen gesamten Gürtelinhalt verwalten könnte - wobei ich auch sehe, dass das Immersion kosten könnte. Auch verhält sich der Gürtel manchmal etwas komisch, irgendwie scheint er manchmal die Taille entlang zu rutschen, aber das könnte auch daran liegen, dass ich meine 2 Sensorboxen noch nicht fest verankert und ausgerichtet habe.

Das Laufen über die Teleportierfunktion ist auch sehr gut gelößt: Ich kann mich nicht einfach auf den nächsten Berg oder an einem Gegner vorbei teleportieren - leider kann ich aber einem Gegner entfliehen damit, da die Teleportation einfach viel schneller als jeder Gegner ist. Auch habe ich einen begrenzten Teleportastionsradius, der so ein bisschen die übliche ""Schrittlänge"" wiederspiegelt - man denke hier an Old-School Dungeonm Crawler wie Legend of Grimrock. Eine recht immersive Lösung, die Motion Sickness entgegenkommt. Wobei ich persönlich lieber eine Motion-Sickness gefährliche Lösung wie das ""dashen"" hätte, da ich in dem Punkt sehr unempfindlich bin und das meine Immersion steigern würde, aber nun gut - man kann auch nicht Alles haben und man will das Spiel ja auch verkaufen.

Und natürlich ist der Kampf einfach toll. Ob mit 2 Schwertern, mit Schild und Schwert oder mit Bogen: Das - wie sich jeder vorstellen kann - ist schlichtweg genial.

Alles in Allem ein absolutes Must-Have für Vive Besitzer. Schade zwar, dass es ein recht kurzes Vergnügen ist und im Early Access nur die Technik verbesser wird und nicht weitere Inhalte dazu kommen, aber es zeigt, wohin die Reise gehen kann.

Outside of those small random things, this title completely transported me into a fantasy world. So much that I smashed one of my monitors outside my chaperone bounds, that's how into combat one can get. Both the skeleton and my screen died. R.I.P.

Looking forward to more content being added to this, and a mattress in front of my screen(s)."

22613416,"So this is how it begins... blocky and comic-like architecture of dungeons and enemies, but hey - this is how it begins. Doom looked also kinda rough in the beginning. I liked the approach to the genre. Many good ideas, like the belt, the walking, and the fighting.

I guess things will become better and better in the next months. I don't regret paying for these first steps towards real VR RPGs.

22589998,"This game does a great job at showing how fun an action / adventure game can be in VR. I wasn't sure how the melee combat would work out, but it felt pretty great to block attacks with the shield and then hit them with a sword. I can't wait for more."
22589552,"Finally got some time to play the game, at least the first chapter.

So far it's pretty great, it's immersive and shooting fireballs at a group is very satisfying. The combat could do with a tweak as shield and sword pretty much kill all the mobs on Chapter 1 so let's see how the rest go.

Overall it's great and feels like you're in a fantasy setting."
22588336,"I've been testing out loads of games with my Vive and once I loads up Vanishing Realms I figured I would play for 5 minutes then move on to the next game.  an hour and a half later I relized that his might be the best game out for VR.  my only issue was that i kept getting taggled up in the wires.  Also becareful if you have a small area to play in,"
22587634,"After 2.9 hours of gameplay, I absolutely recommend this. I totally forgot this is an early access thing, and if more content arrives, awesome! The shield and sword play is just something out of this real world... now, if you want for fun have something heavy handy and attach it to your controller when equipping a sword ;) The other of course, is you sure wish that when enemies hit you they would smack your shield...

One minor suggestion for the devs: reconsider allowing teleport while fighting... great that you prevent teleporting behind them but even side/side... force you say to disengage by stepping a bit back?  Also, was the ""flash"" (fade) effect when teleporting intentional? It caused me zero issues, but was wondering if there were other ways... was ""zooming over"" reported to give people issues?
"
22586177,"Short but satisfying.
For an early access game, I'm looking forward for better interface to operate with item pack.
I'm prefered a moving method with directional pad, not just point-click then telepot to the point."
22581644,"This might be my favorite VR game so far. It's a straightforward homage to classic dungeon-crawlers, except that you actually get to feel what it's like to crawl said dungeon. The enemies are intimidating, combat is satisfying, and the environments are great.

There are a lot of rough edges, to be fair. The bow is somehow simultaneously unsatisfying and OP. The inventory could use some work. Enemies don't have a ton of variety and the big bosses are ""bullet sponges"". But I don't care. I got to fight a skeleton in a dungeon with a sword."
22579655,"Best game I have played on the Vive yet, truly what I was looking for and hoping for with virtual reality.  A bit short but a fantastic accomplishment for a single developer in such a short period of time."

22575267,"Qu'elle expérience, qu'elle immersion! C’est ce qu’on appelle  la présence et difficile de se passer de VR après ça.  Bonne nouvelle les contrôleurs Vive sont plus solides que les murs qui s'en souviennent encore. A noter qu'étant sensible à la cinétose, 2 heures de jeux de suite et aucun mal de tête. Il y a quand même du potentiel d'amélioration niveau gameplay mais c'est le premier jeu VR qui m'a fait ressentir une telle immersion avec des combats épée, hache, arc, magie justes énormes. A conseiller donc, en attendant avec impatience les prochains chapitres."
22574953,"I am a long time Zelda fan (still have both games on my N64). That being said, this game is amazing. If you ever wanted to feel like you have been thrown into a Zelda game(literally), this is the game for you. Yes it is in early access and yes there are some minor issues like inventory management. But the came had way too many pros for such minor details to stop me. I played all of the Early Access content in one sitting, probably not a good idea, but I was addicted. It was one of the most immersive games in VR I have played so far. I didn't want to leave! Anyways here are some of the Pros and Cons I experienced, it may not be the same for everybody.

Pros++++++
-Immersive gameplay
- You get to hack and slash your enemies( or disintegrate them with fire!)
- Different weapons to suit your gamestyle(Archer, Knight, and Mage all mixed into one person)
- Fun exploration and beautiful artwork/surroundings
- A little bit of puzzle solving but nothing difficult
- You feel like you are actually wielding whatever weapon you choose!
- Some fun trap elements
- Addicting( I don't know if this is a pro or con)
- Some fun mini-boss and boss battles

Cons- - - - - (take lightly, it is still early access)
- Inventory system can be annoying. I wanted to navigate back to my torch but since I picked up practically everything I saw I had to spam my inventory until the correct item appeared.
- You need an ample amount of space of at least 2m x 2m.( not a problem for me, but could be for those with small areas)
- Not much else when it comes to cons.

Personal recommendation:  I wish some of the puzzles were a little more difficult to really add a challenge! (Again, still early access)

Well all things aside I do recommend this game for those that love the dungeon crawling and puzzle solving games. Or in other words, if you liked Zelda, you will like this game. It is only a few hours of content, but this is a game I want to support. I cannot wait for the full release of this game!"
22572511,"This is an amazing title that, if anything highlights how well an RPG can run in an environment like VR. However, I'll say that the game does have a shortcoming in that it also highlights the VR locomotion issue. Moving around via teleporting can be.. annoying. Especially if you don't have a lot of room. That's not to say it's the fault of the developer but this game more than most really shows that someone needs to work out a novel way to move around in VR."
22572266,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFDcGulzXY

Aqui os traigo lo que yo llamo el ANALISIS D.I.T.

DIVERSION:

El juego es increhiblemente divertido, realmente te sientes como un heroe, especialmente cuando te cargas al primer esqueleto usando la espada.

INMERSION: 

La inmersion es total. Realmente he recorrido esas mazmorras, y me he sentido parte de esa fantasia.  Al principio pensaba que el teletransporte iba a sacarme de la inmersion, pero en cuanto empiezas a preocuparte por que bicho te va a salir, se te olvida por completo los controles.
De hecho cuando estaba ahi dentro, yo en mi mano tenia una espada y un escudo, no tenia los controles.

TENSION: 

Digamos que tiene una tension media alta al principio del juego, en el que no sabes que monstruo te va a salir ni cuando.  Despues esa tension baja, y en realidad estas deseando que halla mas monstruos para luchar contra ellos. En cualquier caso, luchar contra un esqueleto guerrero cansa.

RECOMENDACION: SI, SI SI...  Jugarlo en cuanto podais. Yo me he sentido como un verdadero heroe exporando unas mazmorras. El coger la esapda en tu mano, y el sentir que puedes derrotar a estos monstruos con ella, es brutal y cuando tienes el arco en las manos te siente legolas total.

22555377,"This game is somewhat short and the monster AI was a little weak, but overall I really enjoyed the experience.  The world is beautiful and is a pleasure to travel through.  The teleport system was extremely comfortable. I appreciated the consistency with direction, so teleporting while facing north will place you in the new location still facing north.  Some other VR games with Teleport will actually change your hero's orientation when you teleport which is, as you can imagine, very disorienting.  In this game I was never lost, I felt like I could keep track of where I was, where I had been, etc so it was a very enjoyable adventure through a nice fantasy world."

This game is awesome, the VR immersion is just unbelievable. 
The way an RPG or Hack and Slash needs to be played.

There are some minor graphical glitches in the game, but it is Early access. 
Nothing that takes away from the game play though."
22528259,This has deceptively good reviews
22528158,"One of the best experiences for the Vive available right now, but some of the squandered potential makes you craving more. 

The combat system is a bit clunky. I wish there was a greater feeling of weight to swinging the sword. Obviously design choices were made, but I'd rather not see virtual objects ever 'go through' other virtual objects even if it means disassociating the held object with your actual hand. In Job Simulator for instance, if you hold a mug and put your hand through a table the mug is stopped by the table and your hand continues through. Not only should your sword be physically blocked by an enemy shield but there should be a momentum calculation as well. One of the primary differences of the Vive from the Wii is that the controllers are tracked 1:1, real momentum calculations are possible; otherwise the combat will just feel gimmicky.

Another criticism would be the dreadful inventory system which the developer has already said he is going address. 

The environments look great and feel great in VR. There is so much here you won't find in any other VR game currently available. The developer has nailed a few core elements that make it fun and satisfying. 

It's worth picking up."
22523186,"I have played up to part 4 so far. This game is a dream come true for many reasons. It is not perfect, but it hits a lot of important parts.

Good:
- Nice visuals
- Intense combat
- The feeling of exploration is wonderful
- Simple RPG elements

Bad:
- The skeletons get to close during combat making it awkard to see
- Enemies ignore you till a certain distance (Not really bad in some cases)
- Short playtime (I haven't finished but know it is on the shorter side)

The game overall is very good. The enemies getting in your face so close you're almost looking through them is the biggest gripe. Otherwise it feels epic and looks great. Definitely a good first attempt at a fantasy RPG in VR. Can't wait to see more from this dev. I highly recommend this game. It maybe be short but it is a lasting impact."
22521404,"Short review: AMAZING!
Long review:
Played around two hours and I think I had a bug which meant I couldn't progress and had to restart once. For a game which is Early Access that's pretty good in my book.

The combat is really fun. 
- The Bow + Arrow combo is well balanced but could be much better if Van. R. adapts the system from Valve's The Lab instead of the one they are using. 
- Hammer and Sword are cool but they could feel a bit more ""round"". Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.
- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there's vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It's just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the shit out of his strikes.
- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.

General movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that's not so bad and can be turned off.

Some minor quirks with how far monsters ""back off"" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that's still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way.

22516363,"I'm reviewing this as an early access game.  So yes I want it to be longer, and the inventory system needs work.  (I couldn't figure out how to drop something unless I put it in my inventory, so every time I would want my pick axe or torch I had to keep going through cheese and a bunch of apples I picked up to look at)  
However, the core of this game is really fun and I really like the art style, world design, and lore that has started to be developed.  I was sad when I finished this because I wanted more. 

If people are complaining that they can just teleport almost inside, and the waggle the sword around then I feel like that is one them for now.  Hopefully the enemies will be pushed back in the future.  For now, you can just teleport in front of them and then trade blows, blocks, and dodges the way it was intended to be played.  At one point near the end when it gets kind of hectic, I accidentally grabbed my old sword instead of my shield.  I didn't have enough time to switch back so I was duel wielding swords for awhile, and that was a lot of fun trying to move around and strike twice every time I saw an opening.

The auto pause was a little annoying at first.  Now, after playing some other VR games, I really like it.  It would be very hard to be in the middle of a fight and have to worry being up against the edge of your play space.  I am looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future."
22513463,"The first skeleton I fought, turned me into the wimpiest, littlest, most scared pile of wobbly jelly that ever existed.

So intimidating!

Awesome!"
22512078,"Nice game, feels solid in VR, but overall is just okayish. It still need some improvement on the mechanics, variety of enemies, and a more polished assets to become a great game."
22510642,"This game is extremely immersive.  The first time I ran into a skeleton warrior, I felt it's towering presence, and I felt my adrenaline kick in getting ready to fight.  The battle mechanics are fun -- you get to parry attacks, counter attack, and block enemy attacks with a shield.  It's a lot of fun and I'm excited for the ongoing development of this game"
22501017,Pretty good game for Early VR.
22499636,"As other reviewers have said, congratulations to the developer who did such an impressive solo project in about 8 months! 
* Positives:
It is one of the longest and most fun games for the Vive at launch.
* Negatives:
I did not understand the ending though: probably there is a bug at the end of Chanpter 2. I ended up with only one enemy left in the time-constraint tournaments, the Tyrant but he woukd not ""wake up"" and no weapon, nor magic, could affect its health of 150. I did what seemd to be the last action in the game (turning on the last fire after finishing all the timed battles), but there was clearly something missing to indicate the end of the second chapter.
Also, even though the graphics is overall lovely, the flat textures break the feeling of immersion."
22497175,"One of my favourite games for the vive so far. I will never forget the first time lean around a corner (or tree), shooting with a bow then going back to cover. And doing this not fast enough ends in having an arrow in my chest is an unforgettable experience."
22495366,One of the best VR games.  It was much too soon to end. Works necessarily continue it
22494931,"Vanishing Realms is among one of the most immersive VR games I have played to date. If you've ever wanted to be the hero in a tale able to strike down enemies with your sword, dodge and block incoming attacks, or even return fire with your bow; then buy this right now. There's about 2 hours of incredibly fun and immersive content, all while in early access. Totally worth it, especially since this game will be expanded even more in the future. If you want a something different than the endless VR shooters (not to be taking negatively, they are great for different purposes), Vanishing Realms offers a unique and immersive RPG experience not available anywhere else at the moment."
22491174,"This game shows off the potential for first person action RPGs with the HTC Vive. It's amazing for being the product of a single developer. I had a lot of fun with it, and I'm stoked for the rest of the game.

Not everything is perfect here. The inventory system felt clunky and I hated not being able to drop items.  You might have to click through all your misc items 20 times to find that torch you stashed after you've put 19 pieces of food there. Getting stuck inside an enemy is odd and the weight of the Vive makes constantly looking down at your bags a literal pain in the neck.

However, the complaints are insignificant when compared to the amount of fun this title delivers. A must for any Vive owner and part of my Top 5."
22485821,Incredible.
22475046,"This has great promise so i will recommend on this basis. I had heaps of fun on the first mission and even found myself lying on the floor to avoid the swinging axes!!!
I had a few problems though -
> Mission 1 i was able to pull a lever to release a monster before i even got a weapon! Please dont allow this because it is confusing for first time players.
> Then i died, respawned the other side of the monster. ran to another door to unlock it and then the door opened to level 2 and i fell through the floor and then the auto pause came up but i had to quit cos i was underneath the play space!
Once these things are ironed out it will be good!"
22473549,"In its current state, the game while a credit to the developer and looks great, needs a lot of work. The locomotion and lackluster combat really let the game down in comparison to other 'cheaper' titles."
22473092,Awesome game. One of the better VR examples so far.
22466428,"Completely immersive, beautiful graphics, and intense gameplay.  As a long time D&D fan this was like a dream come true.  I can’t wait for the next chapter of this game!  I can just imagine someday playing a game like this in cooperative mode with friends.  :)"
22462774,"If you want to try what Skyrim or first-person Diablo is like in VR, this is the game you want to buy. It's an action RPG with gear, loot and a few puzzle elements, but where it truly shines is in the combat.

You will physically hit monsters and parry their blows. You will be immersed as never before, as you are using your whole body to fight enemies right in front of you. You also get to shot a bow, do magic, do mining and explore, but the meelee fights are what sets this game apart.

If you have a Vive, you don't want to miss this game."
22461040,A short (<3hrs) game with only mild replay value but it is the most compelling Vive combat game I have played.  Quite immersive and gives a strong sense of presence.  Only thing I wish about this game is it to make my room bigger.  :-) Definitely worth the price if you want a combat/RPG experience.
22460808,"Very entertaining VR RPG. Still has a ways to go, however what is there now is very well done. My only gripe is the inventory system, I would have preferred something more akin to Call of the Starseed. However beyond that I loved every minute of it."
22456532,"Really impressive early VR title! Loved it and didn't want it to end. A solid few hours of adventure, well worth the cost. Combat, puzzles, meaningful choices, a few instances of good writing. Can't wait to see how it develops."
22455844,"Do not think about it, Do not wait, Buy this dam game. The moment you fight your first enemy with blocking, parry and movement its such good combat and crazy fun its a shame it ended after only a few hours of play :)
"
22450120,"I've just finished playing a couple of hours of Vanishing Realms, which is a typical indie RPG. Honestly, if it wasn't in VR, you wouldn't think much of it. But it IS in VR...and it's all kinds of AWESOME. This hints at what VR could offer downstream, and it's my new favourite of the HTC Vive launch titles. Highly recommended for Fantasty RPG fans.

NOTE: Be careful not to get too carried away with the sword fighting, or you could easily put your controller through a window or a something...like I almost did to my TV.  :)"
22449108,"I want more, asap. The combat could be improved but I stilll loved it!."
22443053,real good
22439890,"This dungeon crawler is a polished, immersive romp in a well designed fantasy world. It features classic elements such as weapon upgrades, magic, and lots of monsters to fight. This is one of those full featured games that stands apart from the sea of flashy tech demos without real substance. This game is easily in my top 5 list."
22433433,Great game.  Blink movement worked well.  Combat is fun.
22428026,Mon jeu préferé en realité virtuelle pour l instant. Le room scale avec le chaperone desactivé donne une excellente immersion dans le jeu.
22420053,"I am really enjoying this game, that's what VR is meant for."
22409181,"One of the more full experiences available on the Vive right now, you get to physically wield the shield and sword, and block and parry to your hearts content.

There's a bit of fuzziness when it comes to combat mechanics since you can practically do whatever you want and teleport wherever you want, but if you try not to completely break the game, you'll have a lot of fun fighting challenging enemies, solving interesting puzzles.

I highly recommend picking this up, even if it is a tad on the pricey side, it's a good 2-3 hour experience you won't regret."
22408871,"Bisher nichtmal zwei Stunden gespielt und ich muss sagen: Ganz im Gegensatz zu den mit der Vive mitgelieferten Programmen und diversen kostenlosen Angeboten ist Vanisching Realms das erste, wo ich mich wirklich voll drin verlor beim spielen.

Als jemand der realen Schwertkampf betreibt ist dieses Spiel hochzufriedenstellend. Natürlich hat man Keinen Gegendruck wenn man zuschlägt oder pariert, aber die Trefferprüfung ist beeindruckend präzise und damit werden Geschwindigkeit und Geschick hochgradig belohnt zumal die meisten Gegner ziemlich kleine verwundbare Trefferzonen haben.

Während fließende Bewegungen, die man nicht selbst vollführt, schnell zu Übelkeit führen können, scheint das Gehirn mit spontaner Teleportation überhaupt keine Probleme zu haben und schon nach kurzer Zeit ist die Fortbewegung ganz natürlich.

Die Grafik ist nicht auf der Höhe der Zeit, aber sehr stimmig und wird auch Leuten ohne High-End System erlauben das hier flüssig in VR zu spielen.

Schlussendich fallen mir keine echten Nachteile ein. Die ganze bisherige Spielzeit war ein 'Das haben die aber clever gelöst' nach dem anderen. Es hilft auch dass das Leveldesign wirklich gut ist und an alte Dungeoncrawl RPGs erinnert.

ich bin sicher noch das eine oder andere Manko zu finden wenn ich es viel weiter spiele aber soweit gebe ich meine uneingeschränkte Empfehlung."
22406917,Pretty good fighting and puzzles.  I've encountered a few bugs but nothing game breaking.  Totally forgivable since this is early access still.  Really looking forward to seeing how this whole game progresses.
22405872,"A fantastic demonstration of what presence VR can deliver. Would recommend turning on chaparone floor bounds though as you will get turned around and can flail wildy in combat. Completed both chapters with the controllers still intact. 

Would like to see a little bit more telegraphing mobs moving behind you though especially in chapter 2."
22400683,I'm going on an adventure!
22394155,"One of the most polished, complete and fun VR experiences out at the moment. The teleport movement works great, you'll be using it without looking or thinking during fighting. Inventory management could use some optimizations (like easier swapping of weapons, you currently have to put them back first) but is workable.

10/10 would smash controller at wall again while crouched on the floor battling skeleton boss."
22391535,"I totally loved playing this and it is one of the few VR experiences that I have been compelled to play for an extended period of time in a single session.

By far one of the best VR games right now and I am really looking forward to the next chapters, for now I have some time to wipe the blood from my knuckles off my walls ...phew...intense!"
22391143,Fun and well designed.  It is short but these are the early days of VR.  If more people buy it and the developer adds more it will be a must have.
22387974,Absolutely amazing game! This is a MUST HAVE!! Had so much fun playing this.
22386739,Great game.
22383076,"The first swordfight with a skeleton in VR that I've ever had, parry; strike, parry, strike!"
22374220,10/10 would get disorientated teleporting quickly again
22370457,"One of my favorites for room scale VR! This game is a great example of getting you into the action, where you are dodging, swinging, shooting arrows, you just naturally figure out what to do."
22365273,"What a great VR game! Good game design, interesting gameplay, good VR design, plenty of safety mechanisms to prevent you from hurting yourself in VR, and on top of that is incredibly visually impressive.

About an hour and a half of gameplay, but I'm not sure how much replay value there is, or if there's any additional levels or DLC planned, so whether this is worth the full $20 is up to you. For me, it's definitely worth $20, even if I wish there was more content."
22364807,"It is with a heavy heart that i give this game a negative review. The reason? NO SAVEGAME. WTF!?!? SERIOUSLY!?!? How do you release a game that can exhaust you physically without some savegame system? The gameplay itself is awesome. Swordfighting with a skeleton is one of the best experiences in VR, but without a way to save the damn game i dont want to even boot it up again."
22362997,"I enjoyed my time with Vanishing Realms. It's a basic action RPG, but the VIVE really adds never before experienced elements. I wish it were longer!

Some issues I have are:

- Not an intuitive way to cycle through inventory, unless I am missing something. I'd be great to see a visual list and choose exactly what I want
- Combat feedback consistency. I share the comments of someone else. It was hard to know sometimes if I was engaging in combat effectively. Hits that would register once would then be blocked. Or blocks that worked once would fail.
- It's easy to move around a lot during a battle, and its a little to easy to get out of the games tracking focus. Would be great if it could be a little more forgiving with room scale movement

Other than that, I think this game sells the Vive better than anything out there currently. It is a gamer's game. It is fully baked. And it's pure joy being able to explore a new world. I want WoW or Elder Scrolls level of world and detail next! (easy, right?)"
22360320,"i dont lickt
"
22358808,very nice game
22352998,Just awesome. Most fun I've had in a game - couldn't stop until the end. Graphics on the demo video don't do it justice. Just buy it.
22352705,"I played through this game a couple days ago and during those few hours had some of the best gaming moments in my 20+ years of gaming.  True the A.I. could get an update and combat could be a touch more dramatic but overall this game is just mind-blowingly awesome.  When I was trying to take out the first caster mobs I was hooked.  It's just the right balance of creepy fear and feeling like a true action hero and adventurer.  It's also one of the only games so far on the Vive to use a RPG/D&D loot system where you can gain money to buy loot.  

The bones are here in this game to be one of the best games on the Vive.  I just wish there were more to play!"
22350782,"Vanishing Realms offers an immersive dungeon crawling experience, where you literally have to pick up your loot and where you literally have to swing at enemies to defeat them. Its brilliant and its fun.

There are two core problems with this game though. 
[list]
[*] Its early access, and it shows. The game length is about an hour with no reason to replay it other than to relive the experience.
[*] It's advertised as an RPG, however when I hear 'RPG' i think choices. There are no choices in this game, other than 'Should i spend my money on this item.' and 'How do I attack this skeleton.'. A leveling system, some sort of upgrade system, or even a few forks in the dungeon could go a long way in Vanishing Realms.
[/list]

I'm recommending this game because its still great, and it has tons of potential, but if you have a limited amount of cash to spend on VR games, hold off on this one until its had more time to grow."
22349551,"I've just requested my refund 30 minutes into Vanishing Realms.  I doubt it gets much better.  After playing the ""Budget Cuts"" demo, it was very evident that not as much love went into this game.  

In Vanishing Realms, I can stand in place and teleport everywhere.  Budget Cuts had me walking around, taking cover, and peeking around corners *in addition to*** the teleport system.  

The combat is awful.  The first skeleton was a bit creepy, but after that I just teleported into their faces and waved my sword around until they died.  Again, to compare, there was one instance in Budget Cuts in which I unexpectedly had a robot creep up on me, instinctively dodged both of the bullets, grabbed a knife, and took it down.  Now **that** was a true rush! 

Some here will tell you that Vanishing Realms is indeed good, and I encourage you to try it for yourself, given Steam's lenient refund policy.  I'd advise keeping your expectations low.
"
22349213,"This game is a lot of fun. I've yet to complete it, but already I'm enamored with it. It might not seem like it with it's toonish portrayal of a skeleton, but Vanishing Realms is incredibly immersive. I found myself taunting the enemies, demanding they ""bring it"" but sadly found myself unable to actually slam my sword against my shield (when they themselves were able.) I laughed at a bowman, unable to hit me with my shield protecting me, only to shown with a volley immediately afterward.

If you like RPGs, this game is worth the purchase, if only for the novelty of ""bringing down the hammer"" upon many a Skeleton's head."
22347998,I don't want it to end :(
22347686,"Very well polished VR experience.  This is a HUGE step in the direction of what a AAA VR game should be.  The combat mechanics are very cool.  Its very impressive that they were able to get a game this well developed ready for day one.  

You have to block, dodge, teleport, and strike at just the right time and in the right location.  You have to learn your enemy's behavior to take them down.  So very cool and immersive.  I don't know if I can ever go back to an XBox controller again."
22342282,"This game is exactly what I wanted from VR. I was really hoping for a Zelda like experience when I bought the Vive and this game delivered. I strongly recommend this game to anyone interested in an Action RPG Zelda style game. The combat is relaly fun and there is a really good sense of scale in this game.

One comment for the Dev though. I would REALLY love to get haptic feedback on the controller when I block with the shield or hit with the sword. It takes me out of the experience a bit when I don't feel the impact of it."
22332651,"Makes you feel like you're inside Legend of Zelda. Graphics are cartoonish but you still 'believe' them inside VR. The inventory system leaves a lot to be desired. 

What you can and cannot interact with is not always clear.

Short right now, but, a lot of fun."
22332175,"Well, today I bought the Gallery Episode 1 and Vanishing Realms because I heard people were raving about these games.  About 25 minutes into Gallery, I had to stop and request a refund....it feels bored to me walking around exploring looking at things solving puzzles are not my thing I guess. Maybe I don't like adventure games.  Then I play Vanishing Realms, holy shyt...this game put me in a beautiful place where I actually really feel I am walking in that world.  It reminds me of Zelda except that you're actually there and not looking at the 2d screen. The teleportation is perfect....it's easy and quick and intuitive.  I didn't like the one in Gallery's...I know there is an option to change it but i didn't bother.  Vanishing Realm's teleportation should be used as a default for EVERY VR game!! It is that good along with Budget's Cut.  I love the magic, text, words, voices of Vanishing Realm, they're engaging. When i picked up the sword, it brought a smile to my face...i am ACTUALLY holding a freaking sword!  I am now ready to beat someone up.  And when i picked up the shield....I feel more than ready for combat.  I begin to search and the first battle with the skeleton was mesmerizing...holy shyt, it's huge.  I feel overwelmed but safe because I have my sword and shield. This is no gimmick folks. Your skills in battle is based on your skills in real life lol.  It was intense and I was so into it that I even hit the wall.  I'm losing my mind. I have 15x15 space and it feels so good to get that bit of space.  I imagine people that have less space might feel frustrated because even I wish I have more space.  So those are the positives i have about the game.  I don't have negatives.

I do wish they have a saving system though,  I don't how you save the game?  You can pause the game but there is no option to save and I don't know if i lose the progress or not.  

Another thing i wish improvement is object collision.  I wish every objects in the world I hit with the sword make that collision sound.  It just feel satisfying to hit things with your sword.  If i drag the sword on the concrete, it should give me that feeling of how sword behaves in real life....with perhaps spark flying.  Anyway, these are just suggestions.  This game is bar-none, a top VR game I ever played so far on VIVE and I played many of them."
22331752,Fun game! Looking forward to more chapters.
22329314,"This game is so much fun. Playing this with the Vive versus looking at screenshots just does not do it justice. I was enjoying it so much I was unable to stop playing this until the game told me I was done, it's that good. It's definitely my favorite Vive game I've played so far.

What I loved:
- Great sense of immersion
- Great style
- Writing (on pieces of paper throughout the game) was pretty entertaining to think about the meanings of and well written
- Little touches - things like drawing the bow string back and getting a haptic tension feeling in the controller

Things that I think could improve or at least considered by the devs:
- Combat
I didn't dislike the swordplay and shield stuff, but I felt like I was flailing a bit more than I would have liked to or felt immersive. I couldn't quite learn what was working against the enemies other than sheer flailing. I could get a cut around the head on the base skeleton warrior guys, but it was hard to replicate it time after time. Sometime I would get blocked. Using the bow and arrow was awesome and, when I was in a bind, would usually be a reliable strategy. Still I would love to be able to feel like I was a master of the swordplay.

I was also wondering what sort of assumptions were made in the way the skeleton characters block that would be advantageous or disadvantageous to either a left or right handed player. I'm not sure if it makes sense, but maybe have skeletons that are left or right handed so there's a chance to even that playing field a tad.

- User interface
It would be great if there's an option to choose a left-handed inventory ""belt"" layout. As a lefty I was picking things up frequently with my left hand, but having to reach across my body to the end slot to put an item away. I'm a pretty skinny person, but sometimes reaching and looking would cause the ""belt"" UI to shift over to the right on me, making it a bit more tedious to put the item away than it already was. It would be great as a lefty to just be able to put things away without having to stare too much at the slot.

- Multiple item ""belt"" user interface
If a slot on the belt contains more than one item, maybe experiment with implementing a mechanic where the user can twist the controller once they've activated a slot and then twisting would cycle backwards or forwards through the items in that slot. Another option might be to show the items in some sort of list that pops out once you've activated that slot and moving the controller up or down moves through the items (only a few around the current one are shown)

All of those things said, I have to say this is the highlight game for me thus far on the Vive. Great job and great start!"
22329179,"Vanishing Realms is the kind of game you dream of as a child. You get actually, physically fight monsters, the game is an absolute blast. The game isn’t without issue however.

The current implementation of teleportation is not as good as it could be. Adding an indication of where you are in your play space, similar to how The Lab handles it would be a great improvement. This wouldn’t change where you are and aren’t allowed to go; it just reduces the mental acrobats you need to go through in order to get where you want to go if you need to interact with an object. Not being able to drop objects is jarring. Yes, you need almost every item you are carrying, but sometimes I don’t want five apples on me when I’m looking for a torch or my pickaxe. The grip buttons aren’t used for anything currently, there’s your use. If the player drops a key object, maybe make the object flash, or give some other indication showing that they may need it. Overall the inventory could use some work, I don’t like having to cycle through my swords, just to get to the one I want.

Combat is extremely entertaining, but as my friend discovered, you can win your fights by “Skyward Sword-ing” your way through them. Near the end of the game, he was just waggling his sword back and forth in the enemies’ hitbox, effectively stunlocking them and turning the fights into a joke. That said, if you fight how you would expect to handle a sword and shield, the combat feels awesome. The choice of giving the play a sword first instead of a shield feels odd. From what I’ve seen, the average player doesn’t try to parry until they are told they can, and that makes the first few fights very panicked. Possibly introducing the shield first, and having the players defend against arrows before being given a weapon would introduce the combat better. I’d love to be able to shield bash my enemies, maybe not doing much (if any) damage, but being able to stagger them would be nice. The magic staff, while useful for massive damage and an AOE attack, just doesn’t feel good to use, it shoots it’s fireball in a disappointingly short arc, and doesn’t have much sensation on use.

The AI isn’t the most advanced in the world but it does try to prevent you from performing the same combinations against it. After a few similar moves, the enemies will dodge your attacks or try to block them, and forces you to try a different attack angle or method. The giant skeleton enemies downward attack also seems like it might not be working as intended, where if the player is within range to be able to hit the giant, the monster’s attack never seems to connect, since the end of the flail lands so far behind the player. All of that said, Vanishing Realms is an absolute delight to play, the environments are varied enough that you know generally where you are in the world. Although the first map is actually quite small if you are racing through it and the second is just the same arena nine times.

Since the game is in early access at the time of writing (April 9, 2016) I expect that the game will grow more over time, and the majority of its issues to get dealt with."
22327571,"I...
went to another world, got in fights with skeletons, got lewt, punched a real life wall (on accident), and now have tennis elbow.  Would do again... can't wait for chapter 3."
22325646,"Unbelievably immersive. After you first come up against a big skeleton and you start blocking it's sword swings you'll never forget it. Love the aesthetic of the game. I personally don't like the autopause mechanic but you can turn it off immediatly so there's no issues there. Just be really careful to obey your chaparone as this game definitely makes you forget you're not actually dungeon crawling and that walls do exist in your house.

EDIT: Almost 9 months after my initial review I've come back after a few updates and things have gotten even better. This is easily one of the best experiences in VR. If you want to go on an adventure, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
22324628,"For some reason it didnt log my hours played correctly on steam. Beaten the content currently present.

This game out of the ones i have purchased is the one that sold the vive for my as a gaming experience.  this is the one that made me feel like i was in a game and not a tech demo.   if you want that feeling and have not had it yet, pick it up.  or if you want to be in a zelda game pick it up."
22322883,"Really cool game! I had a blast playing through it. Exploring was nice, and once you achieve some of the objectives it gives a nice and satisfying feeling.

Also make sure to respect and know your chaperone bounds, especially early on in the game when you're not used to the combat yet. Only stab when you're sure you have enough room :D. I didn't have any accidents, but there were a few close calls where I nearly punched a chaperone wall.

I'd like to see some more refinement on the combat, though. It's great for a first iteration, but I feel that there's some room for improvement. Larger enemies are immersion breaking for me since you need to get close to them to whack them, but then you have non-existant collision and clipping. And their attacks also make no sense then. Also, in general, blocking works well, but attacking feels off. You don't need finesse for some enemies, just randomly flail around and you're guaranteed to get some hits in.

Oh and I love the AI sometimes. When using a bow and arrow, they eventually start dodging your arrows, and at one point they just put their guard up so it's hard to get an arrow in. A great way to deal with cheese. Speaking of archery, right now aiming is done purely with the bow hand. I'd love to see a combination of both bow hand and arrow hand, so it's more difficult to hit near the same spot over and over.

I'd love to see more content! So far it's one of my favourite Vive games"
22319858,"10/10 found a gem, Literally! This game came out of nowhere and crushed every expectation I had for a game of this nature. The only gripe I have with the game is that the weapons really need haptic feedback on hits and bow draws. Also Please add more content! I beat the game in a little over an hour and a half in one go. I couldnt put this game down! Highly recommend for any fan of RPG's."
22319502,"This one was the first game I bought for my vive (except the free bundle) by following recommendations of other players...
and I can say that it worth it. This is really impressive and immersive...it made me jump back when a blade was almost
cutting me ....luckily, this is just a game, it does not hurt, but you really not want to be hit ;)
The playabity of the game is very good and the game is really enjoyable...you almost forget that you are in VR (beware of your room walls :) )
Highly recommended!"
22314976,I have the same feeling in this game as I did when Zelda went from 2D top down view to 3D. It is a really well done VR game and really makes you feel as if you are in large rooms. The weapon and tool mechanics are awesome. While a bit on the shorter side it is a must for any Zelda fan.
22313939,"I wished for a VR RPG and here it is.  The game is short, but sweet.  If you are a completionist, then this game also has acheivments that increases the replay value.   Here's a small tip:  ditch the shield and dual wield swords.  If you look hard enough, you'll earn enough gold to purchase 2 bronze swords right from the beginning.  Then slash both swords from left to right.  There are some mechanics I would like to see improved but overall I'd definitely recommend this game.  I also trust the developer to continuously refine his creation."
22313174,"Very fun and immersive game. Really feels like you're there. From the very beginning I was pretty blown away. My only complaint is that the teleportation system needs to be more like The Gallery's: we should be able to rotate ourselves as we teleport, so that we don't have to constantly turn."
22312460,"Vanishing Realms is amazing! It was my first purchase for VR and I do not regret it. You will lose yourself in combat, fantasy, and magic. I know it's cliche but this game is really awesome! The system itself is very intuitive, as we all know how to swing a sword and use a bow, and in vr it needs no tutorial. It's kind of DnD meets Zelda although in a very simple and satisfying way. If I had one complaint is that it's too short but of course it's still in early access and I can't wait for the full game to come out!

"
22311679,There's just someting awesome about standing in front of a skeleton thats your size and wailing on it with either a sword or a hammer and then collecting the loot.  Looking forward to this game adding more content!
22311560,"Incredibly fun, this game really shows what's possible for VR RPGs. I dream of the day when someone makes a full VRMMORPG in the exact style of this game.
The only thing I dislike about this game is that it ends so soon (It took me 100 minutes for one full playthrough including achievements, though it will likely take most people a bit longer)"
22309732,"Finished this last night.

Probably one of the best early access games I have played. Nice foundation, fulfills dreams first planted by the wii to actually wack shit with a virtual sword.

Looking forward to see where this goes!"
22308328,"I was so immersed, that when I hit an indestructible chest with my sword, I first thought I hit the wall with my controller.

10/10
This feeling of presence is priceless."
22307599,It's fun! it makes me wish I had a bigger room - I've punched the wall a few times.
22306579,"Simply amazing! I have always wanted a game with combat like this, it is so unique! Cant wait to finish this game to the end! In my opinion a MUST BUY!"
22305502,Grabbed a sword. Went back to face this giant skeleton orc thing. It swung its sword at me and I blocked it with mine. Then I stabbed him in the head. Absolutely amazing.
22304884,"This is super good. Swordplay includes blocking enemy attacks; archery, magic wands, hidden treasure. Worth it. Keep 'em coming, dev."
22298881,"As of right now, I'd say Vanishing Realms is the best game for VR that I've played (and I've played quite a few from the vive launch window).  It gave me the most ""wow's"" and ""holy shit"" moments of anything so far, the only rival being Budget Cuts demo (and that's about 10 minutes long once you're good).  The fact that an experience this nice was released on launch day gives me very high hopes for the future.  The devs have a ways to go to turn this into a fully fledged game (the sort of thing you expect to pay 50 bucks for), but the pieces are here for something awesome.

Know this: it's short.  Probably about 2 hours of play time.  But it's worth it.  It's a complete proof of concept for a fantasy game where you are sword fighting, killing enemies, looting and exploring.  The controls and teleportation movement are just about perfect.  I'd love to see other games employ this exact form of teleportation movement."
22298745,"This game is super fun. Moving trough the world by teleporting feels natural really fast. And it feels for now the largest world I feel like I have explored so far.

Even though the game is actually a corridor rpg, it feels like a open world just cause it's super immersive.
Manually fighting versus skeletons is a blast. Dodging arrows behind pillars, peeking around corners. It's all so cool!"
22297742,"Probably my favorite VR experience to date - game is a full on old school dungeon crawler with riddles, puzzles, swordfighting, bowfighting, and magic - but with the awesome modern twist of VR.

When I am holding the sword and shield, blocking a swing with my shield and stabbing the enemy between his shield and helmet, I feel like I'm an actual knight using actual tactics and skills, it's extremely rewarding. Using the sword to parry strikes feels even more awesome.

As soon as you get used to the sword and shield, you are given a bow, and it is equally fun learning to use. Firing it vertially and horizontally, you quickly learn to use it according to your playstyle.

The game lasts right around 2 hours to finish, so it's pretty pricey at a full $20, but I'd say it was worth every penny."
22295744,"Very awesome.  Swordplay really shines in defense, but you can cheese offense a bit.  Just avoid the temptation.  Teleport movement system works well and you explore some huge areas.  I'm through the first section and it was already worth my money."
22295104,"This game is so awesome!  It is hard to express how awesome it feels to be in a RPG like this.  The sword play is fast and feels right.  Double wielding swords is a lot of fun, as is sword/shield play.  The archery is amazing as well.  I totally recommend this to anyone with a Vive."
22295072,"This game is what I hoped VR would be. Search dungeon rooms for loot like you're really there; lean over to look inside barrels or behind statues for hidden treasure. Then use your sword and shield to parry opponents' attacks and then wait to swing while they're off guard, or dart forward to jab a vulnerable spot and leap back before they can hit you. And when I say dart forward and leap back, I don't mean with buttons on a controller.

I have a decent sized playing area, so that's reflected in this review. I imagine it's still fun standing only but having enough room to dance around in sword fights was a huge plus."
22292974,"Easily one of the strongest Vive launch titles, and it's only in early access. The combat is incredibly fun and very gratifying, and the game is visually impressive. The cartoony style works really well. Can't wait to see where this goes."
22290736,"I am a DnD fan, I've played some RPGs, so I was excited to give this a try.  My first session was about 90 minutes and the only thing that made me pause was I needed a drink.  I really didn't want to take off the Vive and get something.  So my next session I donned a camelback full of some flavored water and back in I went.  I played a couple more hours and had such a good time fighting off monsters, picking coins out of thin air, getting my magic wand and defeating chapter 1.  

You don't level up, you don't pick your class, break everything, pick up everything you can and keep it.  The environments are varied and well done - dwarven caves you can mine for big loot, outdoors by the ocean, into tombs and trapped passageways.  Really really well done. 

My only criticism right now is the lack of a clear save point, checkpoint or otherwise letting you know that you can stop here and still have your progress later.  I got reset a couple times, but still had a good time moving quickly through content I had seen before.  

P.S. got shot in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt... it stuck out of my shoulder for a minute.  Talk about an experience my brain struggled to rectify!  Am I injured?  Is there pain?  What is happening?  Next time, duck!"
22290428,"Fun, sometimes spine-tingling fantasy adventure game. Its an amazing feeling to be ""actually"" holding a shield and swinging a sword or jumping out of the way of incoming arrows rather than pushing buttons on a mouse or gamepad. VR at its exciting best!"
22289448,"Very pretty WOW-styled action RPG. I made it through the first level so far and it is both well-designed and very fun. Ssecrets are hidden everywhere, there are good riddles, and the game teases areas you can't access until you come acorss the correct item later. Really gives me the feeling of living in an old-school first-person dungeon crawler. This is also one of the meatier games of the Vive launch and has at least another whole level of content. Very satisfied with my experieince and looking forward to other surprises as I continue."
22284748,"I don't think I've ever had more fun in a video game than I had today. (Given that I'm 49, that's saying something!) The first time I got into a straight up sword battle with a skeleton I grinned like a complete idiot. I dodged, he dodged. I'd block his blows, and he'd leap back to avoid mine. He'd land a wound and I'd yell out of frustration, and every time I landed a strike I found myself taunting this digital mesh with all I had. I wasn't twiddling controllers here, or mashing on the ""X"" button; I was fighting a skeleton with a virtual sword, and loving every second of it.

The game isn't perfect, of course. It's too easy to teleport partially into a wall, and there are pacing issues evident even early on, but frankly, that doesn't matter. After defeating a skeleton archer in a bow battle, I laughed, stood up from behind my cover, and said ""If this was World of Warcraft people would never leave.""

If you own a Vive, you owe it to yourself to buy this title."
22284493,"Remember Knightmare, the kids TV show? It feels exactly like that. And that's awesome. There isn't much depth to the plot, but picking up coins is fun, swordfights are thrilling, and ducking behind cover as you pop off some longbow shots at that pesky goblin is lots of fun. This proves is: Dungeon Crawlers and Hack-n-Slash in VR are a winning combination."
22282743,"This was way more fun than I'd anticipated. I really hope the success it seems to be gathering inspires more room scale RPGs to pop up. Fighting face to face with enemies is a very unique experience, and the moment I discovered dual wielding was viable I was sold. It's not the longest game, but it's definitely a blast and worth the money."
22282151,"This is amazing. You've set yourself apart from most other VR games. Nice art style and gameplay.

One thing I noticed - the sword doesn't have any feedback in the controller if you hit things with it while it's in your left hand.

Again - great game."
22277170,"Overall, this is a really cool take on the RPG genre for virtual reality.  Playing at first early access release all the way through for the first time took about 90 minutes.

I think the control schemes are superb, lacking only in inventory management. Inspiration from dungeon defenders I might go a long way for fixing inventory management.

Gameplay is somewhat diverse, but has some room for improvement in terms of diversity. 

The combat system is pretty superb, the bow doesn't feel as comfortable as the bow from the Lab, but otherwise the combat was pretty top notch.

The loot system leaves some to be desired. Even if monsters dropped items, they don't respawn, so you couldn't pick up more items that way.

The NES Zelda style shops are a good fit in terms of style, but lack the diversity of modifiers present in many other games of this genre.

The lore, poems and monologues, offer a really cool addition to the game, and works really well.

Hope to see more content added for this game, and will definitely look for future work by this developer."
22265381,"This game is my Jam.  The combat could use a little refining, but it's incredibly promising.  Coming face to face with giant skeletons is super intense.  The graphics are nice, but not anything to write home about.  

I really hope this is just the beginning for this game, and it grows into something even greater, but as it is it's already one of the most compelling cases for VR I've tried out so far."
22264461,"Very happy I took a chance on this. Been very skeptical of non-cockpit games for VR, this game does it surprisingly well and comfortably. Combat is nothing short of natural-feeling, and actually ""being in"" a hand-painted environment is just cool."
22256187,"Zelda-style adventuring with the looks of WoW and a dash of old-school RPG sensibilities. I'm totally hooked and can't wait to get back in and dodge arrows, parry sword swings, and search all the nooks and crannies for that sweet, sweet loot!"
22253675,"Excerpt from my review at UploadVR.com:

""The game is a joy to play because I’m not relying on controller muscle memory and buttons to translate my actions. The Vive removes those layers of abstraction. Which button do I press to gaze at an enemy and block that fireball? Who cares! Just look at that archer and raise your shield. Is there an arrow flying at you? Physically dodge it or duck behind that stone column for cover. Need to restore your health? Pull the potion out of your inventory and drink it.

Through these natural actions, and augmented by the haptic feedback of the Vive motion controllers, we’re projecting a tangible sense of agency into the game world in a way that was previously impossible. And the world responds accordingly.

During a particularly heated battle, I was fending off two flanking archers, a healer, and a spellcaster (make that healer a priority kill with your bow & arrow!) who were guarding the coveted Dragon Wand. I emerged sweaty and out of breath from hiding behind trees, popping out of cover, dodging arrows, and just getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment. When you start dual-wielding swords and fighting increasingly brawny boss monsters, Vanishing Realms can even turn into a legitimate workout if you get carried away.

I can easily say without reservation that Vanishing Realms is a visceral, awe-inspiring VR experience steeped in intuitive, tactile gameplay. It has left me satisfied but selfishly craving more. That it was created by a single developer in 8 months is nothing short of extraordinary, and I believe this paves the way for a surge of successful, micro-sized development teams making breakout games for virtual reality.""
