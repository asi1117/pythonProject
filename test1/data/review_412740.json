I've just really started stepping out into the world of VR rhythm games. I've been playing a lot of Beat Saber the last week and really enjoy the game, but was kinda disappointed at the lack of songs that come with the game and DLC is pricey.\n\nI'd had my eyes on Audio Shield for a long time, it was actually the first rhythm VR game I ever wishlisted. I loved the idea of adding my own music. Well I finally got the game and fired it up today. It took a second to figure out how to add my music to the game. Once I did though I couldn't stop for almost an hour!\n\nI finally got to play The Stupendium's song Impossible Geometry... a song about Beat Saber... in a rhythm game! I actually played a bunch of Stupendium's music and it was an absolute blast. Highly recommend that music in this game.\n\nSo obviously I like the game... but here's some notes...\n\n1) About Adding Your Music: You do have to have the mp4 files on your pc in order to add the music to your game. Be it with files you've had on your pc for a while... or even soundtracks from steam (I'm gonna play the hell out of Skul's Soundtrack ngl). It's really easy to do. From within the game you can go to whatever drive your music is on, go to the folder, and then select the song. Once you select the song you get to select difficulty, background, type of shield, and then you are off to the races! The game will auto generate a map for your song to whatever difficulty you selected and the maps are pretty damn good. The only way the music situation can make this game suck for you is if you are the kind of person who has only ever listened to music on Spotify.\n\n2) About the Maps: Like I said the maps are really good for being Auto Generated. There is the occasional moment where two different color notes are immediately one after the other, in the same spot, and it's damn impossible to hit. Otherwise they are really good maps. A word of caution though, your first play through of a song may be a bit laggy. The game generates the maps pretty quickly, but once you load in for the first time that song can be a bit wonky. Once you've played it that first time though it plays seamlessly. You can also save a song to favorites if you enjoyed it so you don't have to hunt the song down again. I will say that the beats seem to be kinda off on Normal maps, but once you pump up to hard the maps are pretty good at matching the beat. Honestly the normal ones only seem off cause they have fewer notes.\n\n3) The Youtube Situation: This is a non issue for me but I figured I would address it. I understand that people who purchased the game when it had the Youtube support were upset when the game had this feature removed. I understand it and it is justifiable if you bought the game for that reason. However, to  me, this does not reduce the quality of the game in the slightest. Like I said.. if you have an actual copy of a song on your computer... you can play it! There's no limit on how much music you can play. There's no modding involved to play a song you like. You can play whatever song you want... and they won't even be sensored *le gasp*. Seriously, there not being youtube only ruins the game if you don't have any mp3s on your pc or on a jumpdrive somewhere. As someone who never got rid of her files from her MP3 player from \"ye days of old\" I've got a ton of music to play. As someone who still owns CD's from \"ye days of old\" I can rip whatever music I want onto my pc and play it freely. As someone who owns soundtracks for various games on her account. Let's fucking go! So seriously. If you fall into the category of \"Person who has the abilty to get or who has mp3 files\" you can play and enjoy this game.\n\n4) Graphics: Omg I love them. You have a selection of a few backgrounds to play on and there's nothing \"spectacular\" about any of them, but they are nice. Where the graphics are really cool in this game is that when you first start the game... way off in the distance.... you can see tons of little dots of red and blue. Those are your notes... coming at your face. It's honestly really cool to be able to see just how many notes are going to be coming your way as you play. They don't show up a few seconds before you hit them. Nah nah nah. You get the full scope of what you will be doing almost right out of the gate. A few songs I played I saw those dots in the distance and was like \"Oh fuck I'm about to get wrecked...\"\n\n5) Controls: The controls are simple. You have shields on your hands and you smack the orbs. Put hands together to smack purple notes. If you wanna get some extra movement in and get some aggression out then feel free to punch them. Simple mechanic. The only thing is that it seems like if your shields aren't somewhat within your FOV that you will miss notes which is kinda annoying. You also can't move much. There is an area highlight that you have to stay in and if you move out of that little square you will miss tons of notes. Not really a control here, but a mechanic. You don't seem to be able to \"fail\" a song. Which is something I really like as it means I can just play and enjoy the song. I won't have my song suddenly ended because I missed a few notes. At the end you see how well you did and it's just kinda all about beating yourself and your high score. So it's not about failing, it's about how good you did.\n\n6) Difficulty: It really depends on the song. I found some of the songs I played were super easy on normal... and not awful on hard... but some songs just kicked my ass in hard difficulty. Which I loved :) tbh\n\n7) Exercise: Omg this is a work out! There is ALOT more full body movement in this than Beat Saber as the notes fly in from a pretty wide FOV. Notes can also come from slightly above you so you have to look up to hit them and then look back down to hit more. It's not rapid head movement, but head movement. The wide FOV makes it so you have to look around and move your body around more. If you decide to actually punch notes rather than just gently tapping them it adds even more to the work out. \n\nConclusion: This is a damn good game and highly underrated. Again the amount of music you can play is limitless. Even more so than modding because with modding YOU have to make your map or hope someone else has. With this game you can play whatever you can get your hands on easily. It's far more of a work out than any other rhythm VR game I've played so far. It can be a bit laggy at points but by far this does not make the game unplayable by any means. The only real downside I could think of is that it takes like 30 seconds to load a song in for the first time... so when you first start playing you need a bit of patience. Once you have a library of maps built up though you'll be golden.", "timestamp_created": 1637448754, "timestamp_updated": 1637448754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "102812845": {"recommendationid": "102812845", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978358984", "num_games_owned": 1165, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 881, "last_played": 1511845156}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game.", "timestamp_created": 1636961234, "timestamp_updated": 1636961234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "102466973": {"recommendationid": "102466973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063112450", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1639349422}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is incredibly powerful\nThe procedural generation has its ups and downs but when it hits it really hits, and its always at least okay in my experience\nthis game will give you a workout too\nHighly recommend for anyone with a vr headset\n\nP.S. you can get the youtube integration back with an easy to install mod, check this link:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/412740/discussions/0/1745594817444647136/? \n", "timestamp_created": 1636432128, "timestamp_updated": 1636432128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "101222894": {"recommendationid": "101222894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021789545", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1634509859}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoy your music and beware Workout EX or whatever its called.

You'll definitely get an amazing workout, and 1-up some people on the leaderboards. ;D", "timestamp_created": 1609347675, "timestamp_updated": 1610123066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83502921": {"recommendationid": "83502921", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990440168", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1609180045}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 (\u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438) - \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c.\n\u041c\u0435\u043d\u044e \u043d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0414\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0445 VR-\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c-\u0438\u0433\u0440, \u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u044f\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440. \u041d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u042d\u0422\u041e!", "timestamp_created": 1609269727, "timestamp_updated": 1609269727, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532627880573272705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82853853": {"recommendationid": "82853853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125050476", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3155, "last_played": 1614481282}, "language": "english", "review": "I have a lot of VR games that I never play, but I keep coming back to this one. Some people will put it down and say that games like Beat Saber have better beat mapping. But that\u2019s because it\u2019s not procedural, like Audioshield and most of the fun is in listening to the music that I love. Also, how fun it is, largely depends on the song. If you\u2019re bored in this, then you\u2019re definitely playing the wrong song. Much of the music I listen to seems like it was made for this game and is extremely challenging. I like the faster pace too.\n\nAs for the negatives, the biggest one is the low volume. I think I read somewhere that the devs were looking out for your hearing, or some garbage. But I can barely hear the music using my Vive. And it\u2019s the only app that I have this problem with. I have to go through a bunch of extra steps to hook it up to my stereo and disable the Vive audio, just to get a halfway decent volume.\n\nThe second negative is that a lot of songs have all of the orbs coming from above you so that you have to crank your neck back, to see what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s not a challenge, it\u2019s just physically uncomfortable, for no good reason. I really wish they\u2019d fix that.\n\nDespite the negatives, this game is my main reason for owning VR, at this point. Once you get into that zone, nothing feels better than deflecting thousand of orbs without missing a single one. You feel like Neo, at the end of the Matrix. It\u2019s almost hard for me to listen to music without playing it. I instinctively put up my guard, when I hear a good song now. If you\u2019re just looking for a good workout, Beat Saber would probably be more up your alley. If music is important to you, then Audioshield is the way to go.

I bought this game over Beat Saber because it actually supports the tracks I want to play. Because i am [i]not like those other guyz[/i], my music tastes are just outside the mainstream that the tracks that i would want to play would never get a beatmap.

Is it perfect? Of course not, but it gets the job done, and that's all i need. Sure, good premade beatmaps will usually be better than anything the game can spit out, but Audioshield still knows how to time the blocks to an element of the music in a way that makes sense most of the time.

Unfortunately, that time has passed.  (TL;DR:  YouTube support is gone, and the procedural generation just doesn't produce an enjoyable experience.)\n\nAt the time, Audioshield had two things going for it.  Procedural track generation, so any song \"just worked,\" and the ability to search YouTube for songs and plan anything you found.  Since then, however, the YouTube functionality has been removed, requiring you to have all songs downloaded to your computer - which might not be an option for some songs that are only available on YouTube.  I can't find any kind of patch notes or posting on why this feature was removed - it's just gone.  The fact that seemingly core features were removed alone would be reason for me to recommend NOT picking up this game.\n\nHowever, the procedural generation just hasn't stood the test of time.  Beat Saber originally got flak for not using procedural generation for tracks, but Beat Saber's tracks have much better flow than anything I'm now getting out of Audioshield.  Seriously, even the provided songs give you wild, poorly paced beats that I feel like I'm either chasing or being psyched out on.  While a custom track made by a person could be bad, at least you have the option of playing something better.  In the case of Audioshield, you ONLY have the bad; you can't have it try again and give you something better.  When the core feature of the game makes it unenjoyable compared to other similar titles, I have to recommend against picking it up.\n\nNote:  There are workarounds to bring back YouTube support (kinda), but the track generation is still bad.

This was the deal breaker for me, it just became too annoying - especially on harder settings when they're coming at you fast! Again, perhaps a setting to adjust the field of play depending on your device would be handy. Plenty of other VR games enable you to adjust things like controllers etc, so something like a simple grid to determine your field of vision would be good. I think it's good that there are some out of your immediate vision to get you moving more, but at the moment it is too wide and makes it unplayable.\nShame, I was looking forward to it, especially using your own tunes - I play BeatSaber, BoxVR, Sound Boxing and Synth Riders, so I had an idea of what to expect, but I was expecting something better for the amount of money I was charged!

As with Audiosurf, the more intense the song, the more intense the play session, made more true when played at a higher difficulty.

And you could do far worse for a workout game.\n\nIt should not be compared to Beat Saber, in my view. They serve two different purposes. Beat Saber is a structured experience, like Dance Dance Revolution, where each track is hand crafted for the song. Audioshield is a procedurally generated experience. It provides access to an algorithm that turns your songs into something to play without needing additional input on your end. Mr. Fitterer has already done all the crafting on his part to make an engine that creates an enjoyable and harrowing experience for you with each song you play.\n\nMuch as support for a streaming library like YouTube would be nice, a moderately sized music library solves that issue.

It makes sense that his next foray into music games would be a VR one. It's just a shame he never stuck with it.\n\nFirst and foremost - I see the potential here. Loved the Audiosurf games, and glad to see that their level-generating algorithms are being used here, as well as the ability to play whatever songs that you currently own. But, for what it's worth, it's painfully empty. Sure, you have several difficulties (including a fitness mode which just kind of makes you squat every now and then), but nothing else that can add flavor or otherwise refresh your playing experience.\n\nI would recommend Audiosurf 1/2 before trying this to compare. Those games had pure style, lights that increased in temperature based on the intensity of the music you were playing. The only thing you get in this game are slightly quicker moving blue or red orbs in a handful of dark/dull environments. Also, and this could just be me playing obscure hits, but every song I played seemed to show a broken leaderboard.\n\nAll in all, the developer seems to shrink away from the game, popping up occasionally to fix a minor bug or add controller compatibility without ever adding any quality-of-life features.

You essentially tap colored spheres with similarly colored shields to the beat. To be fair, the game does a good job of automatically generating beats for songs it's never heard. \n\nThe problem is, that it's really not as fun or exciting as other games like Beat Saber. In Beat Saber, you hack and slash your way through the beat, but in this, you just sort of tap the dots. In Beat Saber, telling whether or not you have succeeded or failed in slashing a block is easy, as there are sound cues to let you know. In this game, you really can't tell. The most you get is a faint controller vibration, and that's it.\n\nAlso, the game has a tendency to spawn the dots which you are supposed to interact with outside of your field of view. This means you can very well lose a lot of points without knowing it. Also, in order to see the dots, you have to crane your neck upwards. So, if you like your neck getting sore after a nice, long VR session, this is the game for you! In Beatsaber, these aren't problems, because all you have to do is just look straight ahead and the blocks will spawn in front of you. \n\nI compare this game to Beatsaber because, frankly, Beatsaber is the better deal. Sure, out of the box, Audioshield offers more songs, but Beatsaber offers mods that expand the song range, hell, I even have a mod for Beatsaber that automatically generates where the blocks appear depending on the beat... which is the same thing this game does.

Ich habe eine Oculus Rift S und dort funktioniert das Tracking \u00fcber die Kameras in der Brille. Da man bei dem Spiel dauerhaft nach oben schauen muss, zeigen auch die Kameras nach oben und \"sehen\" die Controller nicht mehr. Das bedeutet, dass man viele Orbs einfach nicht erwischt, weil die Controller nicht getrackt werden. Wenn man dann mit dem Controller wieder in das Sichtfeld einer Kamera kommt, ploppt aus dem Nichts pl\u00f6tzlich das entsprechende Schild auf. Zudem habe ich es immer wieder, dass die Kugeln einfach durch das korrekte Schild fliegen, als w\u00e4re es garnicht da. Ein Update auf die hoch gelobte Oculus Beta 1.39 hat das ganze zwar etwas verbessert, aber trotzdem habe ich noch viele Aussetzer beim Tracking der Controller \u2013 w\u00e4hrend z.B. \u201eIn Death\u201c durch diesen Patch pl\u00f6tzlich perfekt l\u00e4uft.\n\nWenn man von zuvor viele Stunden Beat Saber gespielt hat, wird einen Audioshield in den Wahnsinn treiben. Dort sind die Farben genau anders herum. Rot ist rechts und Blau ist links. Das Gehirn sagt aber: \"Mir doch egal ob in Wahrheit rechts Rot ist. Da ist Blau! PUNKT!\". Es gibt aber keinen Men\u00fcpunkt, um die Farben auszutauschen. Das muss m\u00fchsam durch Bearbeitung einer LUA Datei im Spieleverzeichnis gemacht werden, wo die \u00c4nderungen eventuell durch Updates wieder r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig gemacht werden. Bei Beat Saber gibt es \u00fcbrigens eine entsprechende Funktion zum Tausch der Farben in den Einstellungen.\n\nEin Pluspunkt von Audioshield ist, dass die Level automatisch zur gew\u00e4hlten Musik (Lokale MP3 Dateien) generiert werden. Diese f\u00fchlen sich aber gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils nicht sonderlich fl\u00fcssig an. W\u00e4hrend man bei den von Hand gemappten Levels von Beat Saber in eine Art instinktive Trance f\u00e4llt, wirken die Level bei Audioshield sehr willk\u00fcrlich. Dazu kommt noch dass die Orbs gerne mal au\u00dferhalb des Sichtfelds kommen. So schaut man sich einfach nur st\u00e4ndig hektisch um (mit den Kopfbewegungen einer Taube) und versucht unlogisch angeordnete Kugeln zu blocken. Der Rythmus der Kugeln passt auch oft genug nicht richtig zum Rythmus der Musik - deshalb gibt es auch Listen mit Liedern die gut funktionieren im Internet. Das ganze Spiel f\u00fchlt sich einfach nicht gut an und macht auch wenig Spa\u00df im Gegensatz zum Lichtschwert-konkurrenten. Man kommt einfach  nicht in diesen s\u00fcchtig machenden Flow.\n\nGrafisch ist das Spiel aber ganz h\u00fcbsch.

Si tu joues uniquement avec les musiques de base, tu risques de te lasser rapidement. Mais la force de ce jeu, si tu y ajoutes tes MP3 : sa dur\u00e9e devient illimit\u00e9e. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nVIDEO YOUTUBE :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7MGSXHqhygOV4bkl6Yf_gQ\nVisite notre cha\u00eene Youtube ! Tu y trouveras des vid\u00e9os li\u00e9es \u00e0 ce jeu \ud83d\ude09\n\nDESCRIPTION :\n[Audioshield] est un jeu de rythme sorti le 5 avril 2016 par [Dylan Fitterer]. Choisi la musique, l\u2019environnement, le niveau de difficult\u00e9 et surtout la forme de tes boucliers.  Une fois lanc\u00e9, tu auras un bouclier orange dans la main droite et un bleu dans la gauche, la musique d\u00e9marre et c\u2019est l\u00e0 que tout commence. Sur le rythme de la musique, des boules de couleurs viennent \u00e0 toi. Ton but sera de les attraper avec la bonne couleur de bouclier. \n\nIMPRESSIONS :\n[Audioshield] est selon moi une suite spirituelle en VR de [Audiosurf]. Au lieu de d\u00e9placer un vaisseau au clavier/souris pour attraper des blocs, il faut utiliser les boucliers que tu as en main pour attraper des boules de couleur. C\u2019est beaucoup plus immersif.\nLa synchronisation des musiques import\u00e9es avec l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des boules est bonne. Si tu t\u2019en sens l\u2019envie et le courage, je te sugg\u00e8re de passer rapidement du mode facile \u00e0 normal voir plus difficile. Car m\u00eame si le jeu se corse, vu qu\u2019il y a plus de boules, le rythme des projectiles s\u2019adapte mieux \u00e0 la musique. Je te conseille, pour plus de fun, d\u2019importer tes MP3. \n\nLE MOT DE LA FIN :\nMoi qui IRL n\u2019aime pas danser car je suis raid comme un tronc\u2026 dans [Audioshield] je me sens \u00e0 l\u2019aise et je me prends facilement au jeu. Comme je disais plus haut, si tu importes les musiques qui te font bouger, ce jeu prend une toute autre dimension et le plaisir est r\u00e9ellement pr\u00e9sent.\n\nThorgan de L\u2019Explorer", "timestamp_created": 1547484895, "timestamp_updated": 1547484895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560000002384185791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48261336": {"recommendationid": "48261336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168251751", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 680, "last_played": 1547242064}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though the gameplay wasn't perfect, this game used to be great because you could play any song at any time with the Youtube feature.

I've given it the full go round now. But its got some significant problems which I may change my review in the future if they patch it up eventually.\n\nOne, I don't mind the lack of youtube support, I prefer to listen to my own library.\n\nHowever, there is a huge problem in that the user interface for digging around your file system is terribly crude and primitive. The truly pitiful thing is that this app is made in Unity, and for under $50 bucks they could easy buy an off the shelf asset store item that would give them a nice drop in ui canvas widget set that would be a thousand times better. I can recognize already they have some store assets in it like curved ui - dump that if thats whats preventing you from doing it. Geeze... get real and if you can't code it spend another 50 and fix that mess or phone someone up who can.\n\nIts truly a pain to navigate. Worse still there is no list view, which for me at least with the way it pointlessly icon views my mp3s makes it near impossible to read the file names. Which you need in order to pick a tune. And, worse you are stuck w your pick for a long time before you can ever get back to a menu to change a new one.\n\nTerrible controls/ui. I don't seem to be able to pause or stop this game while in mid song session without remove headset and kill the task. And even then it may hose up my steamvr instance.\n\nYes, that part blows my mind, maybe I'm just not seeing some UI part? Or control button? but as far as I can tell, once the music starts you are committed till the game decides the track is done. So like if you are just not feelin the beat, you're stuck with it. Good luck getting a different song.\n\nThe exercise feature sounds like it would be great. But there needs to be some configuration options or something. Like make a slider adjuster for the height of the flying frames. I'm not overly tall, 5'11\". But it feels like the frames come in too low. Or it would at least be nice to adjust them based on desire/body height. Some sliders for the amount/configuation of the ball things would be nice too. Sometimes it just doesn't seem to be giving me enough of them.\n\nAnd sadly to say, at least with a lot of the music I've tried with it so far... it just doesn't really feel to me like the game is following the beat very well. And some slowing/pausing effects depending on the tracks frequency/speed really can make for some boring pauses.\n\nBut also since there appears to be no ui to skip to the next track or whatever, or even skip out of the current session back to a menu, I've only been able to try a limited selection of music so far. Which as mentioned before the file nav menu is so bad I can't read half the tracks on the menu to know which one I'm about to pick until I hear it, and then you are staying with that track until it completes for however long the mp3 lasts.\n\nFor as long as this game has been out, and the hype and promo it had at release, I expected much more polish to this game.\n\nSorry I hate to leave negative like this but... my last session spent with this game has put me over the threshold.", "timestamp_created": 1546992294, "timestamp_updated": 1546992294, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574707627296447754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48196223": {"recommendationid": "48196223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032630828", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1585438419}, "language": "english", "review": "For the longest time I hesitated on buying this because of bad reviews (which I think were mostly because people were upset about Youtube not working), but overall if you're willing to buy music it's a blast.\n\nWas able to play songs I had purchased from iTunes and Amazon and was tons of fun (for ITunes you have to navigate to your iTunes Music Folder to find them, but once you've played them the song will show in your Recents section).

My adult son showed it to me one day, and I decided right then I need one of these devices.  It is a great break from the work I do at home. I sit way too much and when my fitness watch tells me its been too long since I did anything, I get up and play a game. It's not that I'm a couch potato. I actually exercise over 2 hours a day, but this is simply a great addition to my routine, and I'm glad I've got it. I prefer it over BeatSaber primarily because I can use my own music with Audioshield. I've got all sorts of music from Classical, to 60's, 70's, and today. I can't do this with BeatSaber unfortunately.\n\nI used the \"Normal\" setting only for about 9 hours of play before I began exclusively using the \"Harder\" setting. I had trouble keeping my mind focused on the game. Not because of lack of interest because I've played it for over 60 hours since getting the device, so I obviously like the game and it is still my favorite of all that I have. It's just that I'm a creative type of guy and my mind is always thinking about something new I want to do. I had to learn to focus and after trying many things for the past 3 months, I have come up what will work for me, and might work for you. Instead of expecting my mind to over time become trained to do the right thing all by itself, I finally accepted a fact I've known for a very long time. The mind can only do one thing at a time. It can do many things very quickly bu only one after another. You don't have time for your mind to think about other things when you are playing this game. There are two things which help me to get consistent high scores. The most important to me is to always keep loose. I don't let my muscles tense up when the music tempo speeds up. I'm reminding myself dozens of times during a song to stay calm and fluid. I'm making sure my shoulder muscles are not tensing up or any others for that matter. I need to focus on each orb  even if for an instant. I see them coming from the side, but they only register as an object. I don't specifically see it as red or blue. When I look straight at it, I do. By constantly and consciously looking to the right and left of my viewing area. I'm identifying specifically what is coming up next. It doesn't matter if I think there is something there or not. This forces my mind to focus on what I am doing every second or micro-second, and if you want to have perfect scores you have little choice but to learn to do this too. \n\nI do find it difficult to understand why so many people are complaining about the YouTube situation. Why do you think you are entitled to use something for free? Companies are in business to make money not to provide free music for everyone and every purpose. I have over 16,000 songs in my library. I couldn't possibly care less if there is a song on YouTube that I don't have but would like to use with Audioshield, and can't. If it ever did become important enough, spending a dollar or so can care of that just fine.

I highly recommend it. It is still a srong competitor with Beat Saber, and I feel that it deserves way more recognition than it has had. Such a great experience.  I am just not playing it as much now with one of my Vive controllers not rumbing anymore; which of course is no fault of the game. It just makes it not as immersive with only 1 controller rumble/haptic feedback.  \n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10...only lowering the score for what it used to be when it had access to YouTube play.

Designing and constructing them from the ground up takes effort and while opening tools to a modding community can produce products of \u2018differing quality\u2019, there\u2019s always the opportunity for dedicated people to produce outstanding levels with great flow. Swinging in the opposite direction, Audioshield chooses to move with the overwhelming option to [i]generate[/i] levels from [I]any[/I]source. Disappointingly, choice to remove its compatibility with streaming services removed a large portion of quantity over quality that the game\u2019s premise aims for. The enjoyment I got out of my time with Audioshield mainly came from digging through old tunes I had stashed away on my hard drive. I imagine that many, with streaming being so prevalent now, will not have much diversity.\n\n\nOn paper, using shields sounds fantastic and suitable for VR. The trailer footage made gameplay look analogous to conducting. But here, you\u2019re not the one striking the notes, the notes are striking you. There\u2019s a problem with the feeling and timing of that. The shields have to be preemptively place before the notes. You don\u2019t hit the drop, you put your hand in from of it and it bounces into you with a feeble rattle. There\u2019s no force required to break orbs or any sound to emphasize their impact, leaving the overall feel of the game to come off as unenthusiastic.\n\n\nI loved being able to see far in advance the folly of incoming orbs. It\u2019s a feature that suits itself well to the available depth-perception and carriers a unique look and ability to tellagraph notes from further out. That being said, the angle at which the orbs approach you is greater than your field of view at times. If you\u2019re unprepared, it\u2019s easy to miss several notes while concentrating on the far left or right.\n\nThe algorithm that runs Audioshield and its counterparts has always been of great intrigue to me and was a key attraction for purchasing the game. It merits some attention, but it ultimately outputs scattered levels that with structures potentially accredited to the placebo effect.\n\nAudioshield provide as a great case study for both rhythm and VR games.

Sometimes the beatmaps can be hit or miss though, depending on what song you have playing. From what I've gathered, a lot of the songs on their front page/recommended are pretty good, although I'm not sure if that's a thing anymore seeing as YouTube support has been removed.\n\nOn that topic, the people dismissing the negative reviews because 'YouTube support being removed wasn't something the dev(s) wanted/it was out of their control' are missing the point. No matter how it came about, the lack of streaming support (as of writing this review) is enough to give a negative review. It's not invalid criticism and I think it's the right thing to do, because it is (or was) a pretty major feature of the game. When people come to this game page, they should know what they're getting themselves into and that they need to have mp3 files or music downloaded locally in order to listen to them. You shouldn't be concerned about hurting the developer's feelings with a negative review, as long as you're being civil and simply pointing out the state of the game to potential buyers, because they have no reason to feel upset by this and I'm sure they are working on a fix even if it's taking a while.\n\nOverall though, I would still give this game a positive review, with the caveat that you should make sure you have the music available locally before buying (but there are tons of services that make downloading mp3s of your favourite songs much easier).

Can't get my money back, and doubt the dev really even cares \"dont care, made money\" even more so after everyone has (for the most point swapped to other audio vr games... with swords.... and the game dev here hasnt made improvements even after that.\n\nI'm not holding my breath to have the game back to how it was, as i said there havent been any real changes since release... and i feel the dev knows people are going elsewhere and there isnt a need to fix anything here (no new customers, allready milked this game for what its worth).\n\nAlso, love the new players with 30 mins of play time telling players with over 200hours of gameplay in audioshield \"stop being children\"... you guys and gals bought it with out the function...they bought it with streaming as a part of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1532907078, "timestamp_updated": 1537773442, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43823419": {"recommendationid": "43823419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058910281", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1517784979}, "language": "english", "review": "Was a fairly good game, unfortunatly the dev has failed to maintain or expand on it and core features have been removed.

It will scratch that VR rhythm game itch.  It's kind of obvious this game has fallen into a hate-hole, where it's getting a bad rep because of the groupthink, but it's actually really good.  really simple, and if you are into really dancing, stretching, and working your lats, it is a little better than Beatsaber.\n\nWithout a doubt, I like this better than Beatsaber. The erratic spawning of the orbs gives a bigger challenge in my opinion.\nBeatsaber IS the better game;  better graphics, better options, but the beat maps that people come up with are really not very creative for the most part.  It's not common to find one where the creator understands counter-placing the blocks to give a more exciting challenge, instead, it's usuall a symettrical, off-beat, subconciously trying to make you move less/move only your arms kind of thing.  Where Audioshield will just put you through a beating right away.  People are saying the game is abandoned, I don't think so.  Youtube flipped the table over and went home when it comes to streaming and synching options.  Last we heard, he's trying to fix that, and that may be hard to overcome, many Youtube streaming services gave up.  He may be just on hiatus while he thinks of improvements.\n\nOne thing that just weirds me out about this game, in a good way, is that the beats for the song are calculated by your computer, but always end up making you dance like the musician themselves.  You have to see it to see what I mean.\nOne bad thing; there is only 3 environs.  But they are templates so you can make your own very simply.\nPros:  Simple, but challenging.  One of the most maximum moving exercise games I've seen.\nThe beat creation is unreal.  Even when it's not perfect, it's still good.\nCons:  Only 3 locations\nMay need a little modding to suit your tastes.\nOrbs in your peripheral are really easy to miss, in a bad way.\nNo combos sucks.

The lack of response from the dev is also a little upsetting because he said he was working on a fix, and we have had nothing for over a month. My main issues come from a lack of developer communication and there being a superior option that keeps getting new songs that a single person can't without pirating or selling theit newborn kid to get legally.\n\nBasically get this if the dev responds with a solution, you have a steady supply of music, or you already have beatsaber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\n\nI got this game AFTER the youtube streaming feature was removed and I'm still incredibly enjoying it.

I really REALLY REALLY wish there was a way to visually see on the song selection menu which songs I've played before (play count or something). Whether it's a Youtube video or a song from my computer, I have no way to know if I played that song before and how much I enjoyed it. Therefore, unless I keep a written record of where I left off I will end up repeating songs I don't like. Favorites is good, but still doesn't solve the problem when exploring new music. \n\n2. Further to the first point, it would be great to be able to give each song a star rating and sort that way. \n\n3. Not sure why, but sometimes globes will pass right through my shield when I'm blocking something on the far right or left, or if I happen to be crossing the shields in a certain way. Makes it harder to get perfect combos\n\n4. This game causes me great amounts of neck pain because of how high up the globes come from. Most of the songs they are coming down at you from a steep angle, forcing you to keep your head looking up. After long periods of time you can get strains and neck spasms. I'd recommend reducing the angle so they come less steep. This is a major no-no ergonomically and for proper posture. \n\n5. FIX THE YOUTUBE SEARCH! It's totally buggy to search in VR, need to use keyboard\n\nPositives\n1. Infinite music, play your own music, youtube etc\n\n2. Gets you moving, flow is pretty good even though the globes come fairly randomly and not always timed to the beats\n\n3.  Great replay value - if you like rhythm games. It's kind of like meditation - relaxing.\n\nBottom line - if you like music / rhythm games, definitely add this to your library", "timestamp_created": 1530028541, "timestamp_updated": 1530028541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43068421": {"recommendationid": "43068421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038667360", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1614289590}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't get the bad reviews. i just got this game i think it is a hassle to look on youtube for music. and it needs to load for ever to read the music. just download a couple of mp3's no reading time works perfect. i just got the usb-stick with music from my car. look on soulseek for good and legal free songs. this is my instant favorite i always start my vr session with my favorite song gets the blood flowing. 1 thing i think the game goes from easy to fuck this get a workout hard. maybe a medium level (haven't even tried hard or legacy hard) . but i only recently got started so maybe i get better. it usually is my first game i show to friends. i bought it for 10 bucks in the summer sale maybe full price is a bit pricy but the game is sound and fun!\n\nP.S. huge guitar hero fan so maybe that has something to do with it.", "timestamp_created": 1530019457, "timestamp_updated": 1530019457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496688753366470337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43065773": {"recommendationid": "43065773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275592442", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1530013584}, "language": "english", "review": "After YouTube support got removed the game is unfortunately dead and I will be requesting a refund.", "timestamp_created": 1530013463, "timestamp_updated": 1530013463, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475743353366851807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43064604": {"recommendationid": "43064604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041297116", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1523810684}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently the capability to stream audio from YouTube videos is broken, meaning to can only play mp3s on your computer.

The \"orbs\" come at you at some points in rythem with the music but this is only an small amount of time when your not trying to deal with point 2. I suspect this is due to the game used a lot of Audiosurf 2 as it's basis and just put in VR as the menus are almost the same and they use Audiosurf 2's rythem system to do the \"orbs\" which is also not good compared to Audiosurf 1. (on Vive the youtube search glitchs out a ton as I couldn't even type as the typing screen flashed up and vanished each time)\n\n2. CROSSOVER, there is a ton of crossover the higher you go in difficulty of where you end up with an sudden blue on the orange side and you miss it due to lack of gapping between the \"orbs\" or it's just too far. This could be solved by multiple modes like Audiosurf 1 however you are stuck with one mode and 3 different shields with 5 different difficulties.\n\n3. Difficulty = more spam, yep just ends up being more \"orbs\" thrown at you with no link to the rythem or even an attempt to and so caused me to zone more on getting them rather than listening to the music rythem to get them.\n\n4. Consistancy is nowhere, in Audiosurf 1 you can easily keep replaying an track and it would be the same everytime making it so that you could learn it and become better, that is in this to an small degree of where you see patterns but there is a lot of difference in each playthrough no matter what difficulty it is.\n\n5. Easy to \"cheat\"Final point is that you can just do one thing to make any of the modes easy and get 90%+ most of the time and that is to just hold up both controllers together infront of your self and boom everything hits them. There will be some at different angles which will require some movement but even if you ignore them and focus on holding them where the main amount is, your good.

I've always wanted to like rhythm games but never could, then I played Hatsune Miku VR and fell in love with it so I figured maybe I'd give some other VR rhythm games a shot. Maybe being in VR was the missing factor in my inability to like rhythm games... This one seems popular but I just don't see the appeal unless it's just a case of there not being much else available.\n\nPros:\n\n1) You can play any music with it since it uses a procgen to create beatmaps.\n\nCons:\n\n1) The procgen beatmaps are terrible. They don't feel like they have anything to do with the music you're listening to at all. I tried a bunch of different difficulties and \"Harder\" seemed to be the best with regard to the speed and complexity of the beatmaps. Casual, Normal and Hard were snoozeville and \"Elite\" is just annoying. \"Harder\" should be \"Normal\", \"Elite\" should be \"Elite\" and there should be an intermediate difficulty between those two for \"Hard\", honestly.\n\n2) The pace of the beats is very awkward. They speed up and slow down constantly. The tempo of the song should dictate the frequency of the beats, not their speed. This is a very awkward way to play a rhythm game.\n\n3) The lack of feedback for hitting and missing. Or I should say, the lack of *good* feedback. If you hit, there's a huge splash of color (which annoyingly obscures the screen a little too much) and haptic vibration and when you miss there is nothing but a line showing the direction that the orb you missed came from. There should be an option for audio cues so it actually feels like you're engaged with the music.\n\n4) There should also be an option for how much of a variance there can be for the vertical angle the beats can come from. Sometimes you spend half the song staring almost straight up. It's uncomfortable and doesn't add anything to the experience.\n\n5) There are only 3 stages.\n\nIf you're interested in this game, I will say I've heard it's better with mods so maybe look into those but, overall, I can't recommend the game in it's stock form.

I'm sure I'll like it better once I find a sufficient number of songs that actually keep you moving to the beat instead of moving randomly while music plays. It's really, really jarring for something that markets itself as a rhythm game. For this reason, I have a hard time motivating myself to play this at all.\n\n2.

The particle effects are fantastic.\n[*]This game is the ultimate for freeform movement. Wanna spin round and hit notes from behind? Do it. Punch every single note as if you were boxing? Choose the Cestus Brawler gloves and have at it.\n[*]Modding. You need a mod for this game if you want it to feel the best. The default settings feel underwhelming and hilariously off-time in comparison to other auto-generation games out there. Fortunately, Discookie's Insane mod is perfect for this. You can even adjust the settings so that it's not \"hard\", but just feels better.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The bad:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Miss feedback is bad. It's just a solid coloured bar that appears over the top of the game. It blocks your view of the oncoming notes and takes you out of it. This used to be better, but it was changed for some reason.\n[*]The built-in support for YouTube is janky at best. If you're playing a song, it has about a 50/50 chance of being slightly off-beat. You don't have this problem with local MP3 files. On top of this, if you play a YouTube song that nobody has played before, you have to wait [i]more than a minute[/i] to start playing.\n[*]No built-in playlist feature. This is more of a QoL adjustment, seeing as you can organise your MP3s into folders if you want this functionality, but it does interrupt a workout.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Feedback for the developer:[/h1]\nDylan, I know you're a busy person, and this is a one-man project, but in this world of accessible developers and social media, you seem to be hidden away and just not involved in the community surrounding this game. I hope that you read this, and start to listen/respond to feedback more often. Give us all an understanding of what you wanted to accomplish with this game, and what plans you have for it.\nI was so excited for the future possibilities that this game could have, but over the almost two years that I've been playing, nothing much has changed from an external perspective. There's still so much that could be improved and polished.\n\n[h1]All in all:[/h1]\nThis game's great. I still recommend this game over any other VR rhythm game if your goal is to [i]feel great[/i]. If you want a proper workout, BoxVR is better. If you want anime-style dance troupe gameplay, Holodance.

Out of the VR rhythm games I've played Audioshield is best for versatility, allowing you to play with whatever music or YouTube video you can find. It also makes you feel like you're an epic hero saving the world from an alien invasion of bubbles! However, I often find that the generation of bubbles can be... Strange. Sometimes you'll get a stream of red bubbles to the far right immediately followed by a red bubble to the far left. I'm not really sure how anyone is able to hit those. It seems impossible to me. Perhaps it's a flaw with me and not the game but it does make it a little frustrating; it certainly doesn't feel like it's me. The game is also just as repetitive and samey as Audiosurf so it certainly isn't something you spend hours on everyday. I have also found that of all the games I've played, aside from Climbey, Audioshield glitches the most often. However, this could be my set up? I'm not sure. The shield sometimes move out of my hands and the game pauses with a grey screen causing me to miss some bubbles I otherwise wouldn't. This doesn't happen as often in other games. It usually only happens during the first song I play for the session though, maybe the whole machine just needs to warm up lol.\n\nThat being said it is one of my favourite games for a reason. It's fun, energising and a great way of warming up for much more challenging games like BOXVR and Sprint Vector (both of which I also recommend, but they certainly need you to warm up and I always warm up with Audioshield). I tried warming up with Holoball today but because it requires full body movement and I was feeling lazy going into my play session I felt no motivation to chase the ball flying at me.I switched to Audioshield for a couple songs and was immediately in the zone even though I did worse than usual at blocking the bubbles.\n\nAs a relaxing game, a way to listen to music and move at the same time (because you know, we need something to help us with that obviously  lol) and my personal favourite warm up game Audioshield is the best.

AWESOME!\nNarrator: As it turned out, it wasn't awesome.\n\nEnglish isn't my native, please be gentle. \n\nI would say I was pretty hyped to play AUDIOSHIELD, because it's often mentioned when there is a \"TOP 10 GAMES\" of VR. I played Guitar Hero on the Wii so I thought I'd get a similar feeling while playing (reads: to feel as being one with the music), but there is one big issue for it and that's - rhythm.\nThe ONLY thing this game is being expected from is that you, beating the orbs, are in sync with the beat you're listening to, but exactly there, it fails. \n\nMost of the time it felt like I was beating orbs which have nothing to do with the music that currently plays. And that is, mildly speaking, boring. \n\nFirst I tried the two first choices I was presented with and then chose \"This cannot continue\" from the NieR: Automata OST. The last one has some parts with heavy emphasis on the beat and I had expected that this is one of the tracks where the game can shine the most. \nFor example: the singing voice has a few long streched out words, before the last one's are sung with a heavy tonation on each word and it all ends with a final \"HUAH!\" shout (like the last part of the FUS-RO-DAH). The change of tone your hear of these three parts wasn't converged into the orbs flying to me. At all. At least for the last shout you would expact a single big bubble you have to block, but it's merged into one big \"tube\" to block with the rest of before.\nFor the rest, most of the time you beat bubbles out of sync to the music beat.\n\nVisually, it is okay. The bubbles look crappy but the particle effects the moment you block them give you a nice feedback for your success (with the controller rumble).\n\n\nI had no time to play it within two weeks, otherwise I would have refunded it. \n2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1516396434, "timestamp_updated": 1516396434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459954828023910522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39463305": {"recommendationid": "39463305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085401221", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1539188586}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est juste un Must have pour tout utilisateur de VR", "timestamp_created": 1516382944, "timestamp_updated": 1516382944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39454750": {"recommendationid": "39454750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285378682", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1537724479}, "language": "english", "review": "Well my friends and I have been playing this game a lot.

One of the main reasons I enjoyed this game was because I could play any music directly from Youtube.  However 2 years later after moving into my new house and firing this game up again hoping to play some of my new favorite songs, I was very disappointed to discover the Youtube feature is no longer there.  The only way you can play your favorite songs now is to have them installed on your computer somewhere.  Otherwise you're stuck with the included songs in the game.  I don't store music on my computer anymore, and in fact some of my favorite songs I don't have digital copies of.  I immediately closed the app and will delete it once I get finished with this review.  I will no longer play this game without the Youtube feature and I don't suggest anyone buy this game in its current state.   \n\nBelow you will find my original review of this game highlighting how fun its USED to be.   It's such a shame that this game has been ruined.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - 1/9/2018\n\nThis game is extremely fun.  Its a simple concept but the fact you can use virtually any song makes the replay value endless.  I finally got around to playing it last night after picking this up on the Steam winter sale, and it was worth every penny and more.  In fact even at the regular price, I think its worth the cost.\n\nYou can use music from your personal library, pre selected songs, or you can use youtube videos.  I had a blast and I will be playing more today.\n\nI probably look like an idiot playing this game to observers, but I don't care, this game is amazing.  If you like rhythm games like guitar hero, piano tiles, then this is a must buy.\n\nI small suggestion would be to add more skins and I hope that's in the works.", "timestamp_created": 1515513029, "timestamp_updated": 1589689169, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39202772": {"recommendationid": "39202772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003527182", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1615127587}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing!

I would like to see the rapid / slider notes have some simultanious variants.\n\nEdit: I'd love to see a custom chart creator, just so we can get actually fun patterns\n\nOther than the beat patterns being sometimes bad (because it's not mapped by a person) the game is fun and worth giving a go if you like rhythm games.", "timestamp_created": 1515285125, "timestamp_updated": 1515285240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39132085": {"recommendationid": "39132085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054717668", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1631546529}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing fun game. \nTime flies past because this game has a serious amounts of one more go syndrome. \np.s if you live with your partner expect its my go arguments :)", "timestamp_created": 1515274903, "timestamp_updated": 1515274903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39128184": {"recommendationid": "39128184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071711428", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1545606097}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't review many games but felt it was worth doing since the Dynamic Update has been released.\nThis has made the game a much more polished experience and aesthically more pleasing. \nThe game overall is excellent.

In spite of this, I still can't recommend it because it just feels very beta. The UI is finicky and unrefined, the hit detection can be a bit off when the shields are held closer to you, but the big one: the beat generation is pretty bad. This is really noticably when you get in the zone, and start moving with the music more. Often times the beats don't feel aligned with the most impactful movements of the song. Song's got thundering bass? Well we're gonna follow the weak little melody. And then when it does get the beats of the song right, they feel off. The genres I was playing with were modern electronic, as well as some 90s techno.\n\nThe other big one, I think the play testers for this game were all taller than me. I'm short, and hitting some beats can be challenge because they're out of reach of my handspan. THis happens especially often during sections which require you to cross your arms. \n\nI wanted to love this game as much as I did the original Audiosurf, but sadly that didn't happen. Still, it's a nice bit of light cardio, and I'm probably going to keep using it for that.\n\nWith some tender love and care, this game would be worth every penny, but for now, that's not the case.

After putting over 30 hours into the original Audiosurf, I can't not love this game. Hands down, best music fighting VR game out there.\n\nThat being said, the more you play, the more apparent the issues become and I have a few gripes. \nFirst, I don't like that the orbs come from an upwards angle. I'd much prefer a lower, more straight angle for my neck's sake. I've noticed it's different for different songs so I wonder if there's something in the algorithm that decides this (I'm pretty sure it has to do with volume or speed). This isn't terrible once you get used to it but still not my favorite.\n\nSecond, the song accuracy is not quite there yet. I'd say it's probably about 80%. When it works, it's absolutely amazing and there are times where I've hit the perfect groove and it's one of the greatest experience VR has to offer. When it doesn't work, it's confusing and a bit frustrating. A lot of this seems to stem from the difficulty setting, which I'll get into later.\n\nThird, the hit detection doesn't always seem right. It seems the shield has to collide properly with a certain portion of the orb, which causes grief when you actually hit the orb but don't pass that threshold and it counts as a miss. I've also noticed that if I swing and sort of slap an orb, it doesn't usually count. I'm not sure if I'm just not hitting it or if that's not detected properly, but it bothers me.\n\nFourth, I think the difficulties need to be tweaked to provide better challenges. It seem like the game is balanced around the middle difficulty, with that appearing to be the intended way to play and the most in-tune with the algorithm. The lower difficult just has less orbs, and the higher difficult has more orbs (to a fault sometimes). Often the higher difficulty throws hand-crossing orbs in such rapid succession I'm doubtful it's actually physically possible. It also occasionally throws orbs at you from outside your peripheral vision, which is kind of a dick move. The middle difficulty is really the sweet spot, but sometimes I can't help but wish for more orbs, as long as they were fair in in logical patterns.\n\nFifth, the choices for environment and shields are pretty crappy. I picked the top ones when I started and none of the others feel right. This might be just because I've gotten used to the game like that, but honestly the stage and beach environments feel really distracting and off.\n\nSixth, I would love some support for putting together playlists so I can play songs consecutively. I like to use this as a way to get myself active and doing albums is my favorite way to play.

The silence and lack of communication states volumes and is very saddening. Game cannot be recommended on its own unless you already own a robust music library. I would recommend Beat Saber over this anymore. While it also doesn't have a streaming option, the gameplay has a much better frame work than Audioshield does and it much funner in that sense. There are many custom songs for it as well. \n\n\n\nOld Review: 80/100. Game is fantastic, but it has its flaws. The primary of them being that interaction with the menu is a pain. An inability to log into your Youtube account and play preselected playlists and that the modified Youtube search that this browser uses is quite obnoxious as song titles have to be rather exact to find what your looking for.\n\nI understand the reason for the later or at least I assume I do. The reason I would assume is so that the leaderboards are more populated and thus I'm rather mixed on this as I really, really like the leaderboards.\n\nIntergration into streaming services would be the best thing that this game could implement. I understand the limitations of it needing to parse the song entirely before beginning and whatnot, but surely there could be a way to work around this by working with these streaming services?\n\nAt least in an ideal world. Unlikely to happen given the all the IP restrictions on music so I won't place much blame on the developer. Just makes me sad at how wonderful it would be. Also would be good for the leaderboards so that there aren't duplicates as there are on Youtube. \n\nI would recommend the game. Even at asking price. If looking for something liesurely to pass the time, maybe not. Especially if you aren't in shape and don't care to get in shape. Game on low difficulties is rather boring. At high difficulties it is tense, fast pace, and unforgiving. Gets your blood pumping and can definitely get a good sweat going. An unfortunate thing with the Vive foam pads as they do soak. I like to run a fan swiveling towards me. \n\nIf looking to get some cardio in though, 30 minutes of this a day cannot be beaten. It will get the heart going and its fun.

Once Beat Saber released, that was no longer the case. Since then, Audioshield has actually gotten worse as an experience with the loss of YouTube integration. Is Audioshield still worth getting?\n\nI would say maybe, but only on a deep, deep sale ($8 bucks or preferably less). It's still fun as a workout where you can listen to your tunes. You pretty much do have to bring your own music as the included music soundtrack is pretty forgettable. There are mods you can download though (I don't include detailed discussion of mods unless it's a game like Garry's Mod or HLA where the mods are included by the dev themselves). \n\nThe problem is the computer algorithm for the beatmaps just isn't as good as the beat maps from the top VR music rhythm games, that are mostly hand-crafted. Also, the core gameplay is just too simple compared to the current generation of VR music rhythm games like Beat Saber, Audio Trip, Synth Riders, OhShape, etc. Compared to those games, Audioshield just looks dated now. A VR game from a bygone era .... 2016. This game is still fun for a workout with tunes, but it's not good when thinking about beatmaps that actually enhance the musical experience or make you feel like you're dancing versus just playing a competitive game of chasing the leaderboard to music. \n\nAudioshield is running on the Unity Engine and it was running at a steady 90 frames per second for me on my 1060 GTX. I experienced zero issues (well, except on WMR where it seemed that less than a full battery charge on motion controllers caused issues with the hit detection, but I'll blame WMR versus the game). The visuals and backgrounds, however, are also a bit dated now in 2020. \n\nAudioshield is good for nostalgia reasons for some. I just can't recommend this over many other VR music rhythm games. It's definitely a buy on deep, deep sale only neutral recommendation. It's not bad, it's just that there's so many much better VR music rhythm games now. This was seen as the best VR music rhythm game back in 2016 by many (I only started playing in 2017 so it was never my favorite), but now in 2020 it wouldn't even crack my top 20 list of VR music rhythm games.\n\n[b]Rate 5.5/10.

You can also select from YouTube videos, and not link to Favorites. I remembered I had about 8gb of music on an old flashdrive and uploaded them. Just a bunch of favorites.\nI do have to say this one is my favorite VR game. The trailer on Steam is pretty accurate other that not being able to capture the full aspect of VR. Play is stationary, i.e. you can stand in one area as long as you have the abilty to reach out with your arms in an ~120 degree arc, so not overly wide. A bit of overhead so be careful of ceiling fans.\nGameplay is simple, you hit the incoming blue and orange (red) dots, you get points on accuracy, style, and punch power. This is also a great arms workout (I'm thinking of adding some weight straps just for effect).  The hand units vibrate briefly when you strike an orb adding to effect.  \nThis is a great way to spend an hour listning to music, getting active, and competing with Global, Regional, and Friends level achievements.

My most played VR game, and for good reason. \n\nThe ability to play your own selection of music means you can easily get lost in the groove, and this obviously adds a lot of variety. The beat detection algorithm isn't perfect, but for the most part is perfectly adequate if the quality of the audio reccording is sufficient - garbage in, garbage out. With a bit of practice, you can soon learn how the algorithm is treating each song and focus on those elements; once you figure this out, you can start throwing some great shapes :) Scores are submitted to the global leaderboards, and you can choose to ignore them, or try to get yourself to the top, adding a further layer of replayability. The difficulty levels scale reasonably well, from normal mode where you won't have to cross your arms and can almost stand still, to Elite level where - with the right sort of song - you will be active for every second, with frantic flapping of arms and bouncing around your playspace...\n\nWhilst the ability to play any song adds almost infinite replayability and variety, the lack of arenas makes thigns a bit \"samey\", and if your local music library is not organised very well you will not have fun navigating the interface (though there is a working search function!!), but these are very minor points and in no way impact the actual gameplay which is itself, flawless, in my opinion.\n\nIt's also an excellent demo/introduction to VR; there is no involuntary movement so relatively free from nausea problems, the concept is very easy to understand, the normal mode is very forgiving, new players can try it out on a song they know/love and this really aids in getting comfortable with the VR environment.\n\nIf you own a VR headset and enjoy listening to music, you can do a lot worse than picking this up, sale price or not. You can become Lord of the Dance too...\n\n[edit] Unfortunately, since writing this review built in Youtube streaming has, perhaps understandably, been disabled. I have a vast local music library and was never reliant on this feature, although I understand there are ways to re-enable it, if you are willing to delve into and edit some core file(s).

It's fun to play and a nice exercise.\n\nHowever there are also a few downsides:\n- When playing Youtube songs, the game gets stuck at loading the song from time to time (mostly after about 5 or 6 songs) and I have to shut it down. That's annoying as the recent songs and favorites are not saved. So I manually close Audioshield after 4 songs to avoid this.\n- The search in Youtube only delivers a handful of songs and it is hard to find the version of a song you want. It would be great to be able to add Youtube links to the favorites outside VR.\n- For some videos on Youtube the game tells me that the song has to be processed as it is started the first time and it would not happen the next time. It happens every time I start these videos and takes quite a while.\nExample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVgSuuUTwQ\n\nSo even if the game is really nice and fun to play, the downsides are pretty annoying for me. But I still recommend it, especially if you don't encounter the stuck issue when loading the songs.\nIn a rating I would give it 6,5/10. 8/10 if it would not get stuck that often and the songs really would just have to be processed only once.

I used to love DDR when I was a teenager, and this game is like a VR version for your arms, except it's even better because you aren't limited by song choice. You can play any audio with it, which I absolutely love!! This game has helped me actually enjoy exercising again for the first time in years. Because of that, it is also helping me with my depression and anxiety which is this incredible and unexpected benefit that I cannot thank you guys enough for.\n\nI have been obsessively playing this game almost every day since we got our VR headset at the beginning of this month (and felt ridiculously deprived for the week when we had no headset because we decided to return the VIVE and get the Rift instead.) I'm absolutely in love with this game. Because of that, I have a few suggestions that I really think would make it even better.\n\nFirst, I wish there was a way to adjust the height/width of the playing area and the shoulder level of the game. Sometimes, the red and blue spheres come flying from so high above me that my neck is craned way, way back to the point where it really hurts my neck and shoulders and they start to cramp up. If there were a way to manually set a limiter for that it would be such a relief. It doesn't even need to be adjusted that much; I enjoy that the height changes throughout the song, it just goes too far back for me and it becomes painful. I know I can take a step back behind the shoes on the ground as a sort of \"quick fix\" but it doesn't completely work because then the spheres are flying into the wrong area and then I find myself bending forward in an awkward position instead of it being the fluid dance that it usually is. If we could set our own parameters so that it fits our unique body that would be so nice. Same thing with the horizontal area from left to right. Because the edges of the headset don't allow for as much peripheral vision as we have in real life, I am constantly noticing a sphere here and there wayyyy off to the side that completely escaped my attention and I missed it because it was out of the range of my peripheral vision and I didn't even know it was there. It's not the end of the world, but it's definitely frustrating when you know that you wouldn't have missed it if you had actually been able to see it. I love how the game has a wide playing area, but for me I feel like it just needs to be slightly smaller to be comfortable. I wouldn't mind having the option for the spheres to go lower than they currently do, either.\n\nAnd as a way to make that whole idea even more user friendly, you could also allow us to set multiple profiles within the game so that if multiple people in the household play the game often, they don't have to constantly manually adjust these settings each time they switch. They can just select their profile (shoulder level, playing area size, etc.) and go. And I wish you could switch between steam accounts easily under one game setup. My fiance and I play most of our VR games through his account (this one) because it's just easier. But now all of my high scores are under his account so I don't get bragging rights. It's too much of a pain to switch between steam accounts all the time so I just don't worry about it. Still, though!\n\nOkay, and one more super cool idea. I'm sure everyone keeps telling you that you need more places to play (since there are only currently 3 locations to select from.) Well, what if, rather than having to make a whole bunch of new locations, you just made it compatible with Steam VR Environments?? Then anyone could choose from any environment they love, download directly to the game, and play there! That would really take Audioshield to a whole new level!!!\n\nLast but not least... I think that at some point there needs to be an even harder level than Elite. It is still wonderfully challenging, but some songs are so much better than others (pattern-wise) and there are songs I would love to play but even on elite they are just too slow between spheres. And some songs where there are really challenging parts (usually when the music picks up) but there are still long sections of the song where there are less spheres and it gets a little boring. And then there are songs that are really hard throughout the whole song and I LOVE that. Every time I find a song that is challenging the whole way through I'm like YESSSSS!!! The best part of this game is that it not only challenges your body to keep up, but it also challenges your brain. I'd rather do harder levels, even if I miss more, because my brain stays so focused and entertained in addition to the exercise I'm getting. That's the part that keeps me coming back for more!\n\nThank you again for making this game -- it is absolutely fantastic!! I LOVE IT!\n\nEdit: Yes, please, please, please create a harder level than Elite. Roughly 75% of the songs on that level are too slow and boring already.There needs to be some feature that allows you to add more spheres to the song to make it more fun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1500625885, "timestamp_updated": 1501003376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33663024": {"recommendationid": "33663024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991438767", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1532387341}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Julio de 2018 ya no lo recomiendo, quitaron la opcion de elegir la musica desde youtube y basicamente el juego se quedo sin canciones.. solo da 4 o 5 que nadie conoce y ya no es lo mismo.\n\n\nMuy divertido y el hecho de poder elegir la musica directamente de youtube le da una variedad inacabable.\nal principio cuando uno se mueve de mas, algunos temas te sacan la gota gorda.. pero a medida que te vas habituando al sistema eso ya no ocurre, solo tiene 3 ambientes de juego pero esta bien lo importante es que sin darte cuenta estas reboleando escudazos para todos lados, y bailando seguro al mismo tiempo.. es el juego que cualquier invitado en casa no deja de probar.", "timestamp_created": 1500514517, "timestamp_updated": 1532499347, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33638201": {"recommendationid": "33638201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966435018", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1517774161}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent thousands of hours playing hundreds of games on PC and this is the first one I feel strongly enough about to write a review.

I would say Audioshield is the game with the \u201cmost covenience factor.\u201d\n\nYou can just jump in, find a YouTube song and play. All the beatmaps are created by an algorithm, and if the song was never played by anyone before, Audioshield will scan it and create the beatmap for you. \n\nThe game doesn't require third party programs to access music libraries and it doesn't require people to create beatmaps for you (or it doesn't require you to create one). Sounds good so far and it's the main reason I like Audioshield \u2013 there is little upkeep required.\n\nSince the beatmaps are created by an algorithm you can choose difficulty, so you can start slow and work your way up the difficulty levels, again a good thing about using an algorithm VS user made beatmaps. This also lets you avoid silly beatmap, where the person who created it does something very complicated that it is really not intuitive at all.\n\nWhile I seem to praise Audioshield's algorithm, I didn't really touch on the quality of its beatmaps which greatly varies from song to song. Audioshield seems to work best with classical music (for example try the Star Wars soundtrack), especially when there are no vocals. Volume seems to be the factor that influences beats the most.\n\nAudioshield will always throw you beats that correspond to something in the song, but what it does throw at you changes from attempt to attempt and it can be seemingly random. One time you will have to punch your way through the bass. The next it will be two beats from the base, one from a word it picked on, 1 from the drums, 1 from the guitar. This makes it seem like the beats are not on the rhythm. It is also very apparent that the algorithm can't fully distinguish the various instruments. Sadly, I don't think it's possible to code an algorithm that can do that perfectly, unless the instruments are saved on separate tracks. This is essentially what Holodance does for their story mode songs \u2013 they separate the instruments and then map them.\n\nMovement wise, Audioshield is my favourite. You use more of your virtual canvas than the other two games, certainly more than Soundboxing. You can make very large and sweeping movements, thing which you can do with Holodance, but Audioshield does it to a bigger degree. The bigger canvas however does present the issue of missing some beats because they were out of your field of view. It also presents issues at higher difficulties, where you have to touch to beats on the opposite sides of your \u201ccanvas\u201d with the same hand in a VERY short time. I lost count of the amount of times I yelled, \u201cI don't bend that way!\u201d\n\nAlthough I do lean towards a particular music genre, my taste in music is fairly eclectic, so I find I can't stick to only playing Audioshield because some of the songs I want to play work better in Soundboxing. But when I am tired to play U2, Anastacia or ACDC in Soundboxing, and I want to play Singing In The Rain or the Star Wars Imperial March \u2013 Audioshield is definitely my go to.", "timestamp_created": 1499457640, "timestamp_updated": 1499457640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33297442": {"recommendationid": "33297442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987165926", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1537063394}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

I rather enjoy the Hard and Elite difficulties, it's a great game to just put on as a warm up or even just to play for an hour or too.

Tracking of the headset and controllers is smooth as anything and I've had no major issues with the game aside from the occasional weird shake in the menus and you don't need a large play space either.\n\nI'd definitely recommend giving this game a go, especially if you've got a decent music library of fast/upbeat tracks (although there's an option to use YouTube too!)\n\nOverall, I'd give it an 8/10, a fun experience that could do with a few modes (maybe Workshop content like AS2) and maybe some harder difficulties without needing to mod the game to do so.", "timestamp_created": 1499194251, "timestamp_updated": 1499194251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49751242995262146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33233721": {"recommendationid": "33233721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093759418", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1498826156}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried them all out: Audioshield, Soundboxing, Holodance, Beats Fever and Airtone.\n\nI directly need to say Audioshield was the worst of them. \n\n1.\tAirtone (most expensive, great look and gameplay, limited songs) Highly recommended!\n2.\tHolodance (really really great, nearby nr. 1 and by far nr. 2) Highly recommended!\nx (Soundboxing - can not recommand at this time as it is very buggy, uploading beatmaps does not work and virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users)\n3.\tBeats Fever \n4.\tAudioshield\n\nAudioshield: it did not feel like a rhythm game at all and it had only a few sound-stages. The gameplay was not in sync with the music as the algorithm does not do that well. Every game with predefined beatmaps is far superior. You Tube integration does not help. Gameplay feels often chaotic and shallow.\n\nSoundboxing: Gameplay felt more serious as in Audioshield. It has user made beatmaps and a youtube integration. You can easily create beatmaps to your own favorite songs and share them. It has 12 different show-stages. -- Can not be recommanded atm as uploading beatmaps does not work and the virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users --\n\nBeats Fever: Good looking environments, 40 songs with predefined beatmaps. Songs are a bit generic, gameplay is okay but does not feel that organic. A bit chaotic at times. \n\nHolodance: with Osu! integration, great looking, fun gameplay, definitely one of the best. Through Osu integration nearby infinite gameplay. Highly recommended!\n\nAirtone: Best rhythm game out there, if you can life with Japanese pop. It has the best rhythm gameplay of all of them: you have to punch/slap the notes, just holding the stick in the direction is not enough; your punches/slaps make a sound when you hit so you hear the rhythm you are beating (not just a short vibration), the presentation is very beautiful, every song has three difficult levels, all in all very fun and addictive. 25 Tracks included.

It allows you to pick ANY youtube video and have it convert to notes and have you dance to it. It gives an incredible workout and makes you feel like a total boss climbing up the leaderboard. That said there are a couple complaints. The main being frequent crashes. Sometimes when I am in a game the thing starts to glitch. For some reason some songs are worse than others. I play this one song ([Sukone Tei] Psychotic Love Song) and while it is one of the most amazing songs for audioshield, it tends to crash halfway through. I am able to play for long periods of time but the game gives way to many crashes. A couple days the video searching function didn't work. My only other complaints are the lack of variety and it being easy. Sometimes I put some really intense songs.....only to have the notes go very slow. It ruins the groove and I can't play some songs I otherwise really enjoy. As for the lack of variety, there are only blue notes, red notes, and purple notes. Sometimes you hold them in one spot but that's about it. In a FEW (As in like 3) songs I found spots where the long notes curve and have this little twist. If there were more things like that then the songs would be more interesting. \n\nInteresting ideas:\n-Times where you have to completely freeze (Hopefully matching quiet parts of some intense songs like right before the beat drops)\n-Certain notes that you have to dodge (Whole body if possible)\n-Green notes (maybe another color) that make you have to move your hands in certain patterns\n-Community-made notes that will fit songs. Like, you could go with the actual formula or choose a pattern someone else made\n\nI don't know.

I was a big fan of Audiosurf, mainly because I could select my own music to play. Audioshield is a great new version on Audiosurf. \n\nThere are some things that could be improved upon. \n\nI've noticed that there are a lot of complaints about the game being too easy. From what I've noticed, the better quality audio source, the harder the game is. Many people use the YouTube stream feature for play, where the audio is heavily compressed. It seems that the game does not read each note as precisely as if you use a music file from your computer. I've also noticed that, while using music from your computer, there is a difference in difficulty between bit rates. I have played the same track in 128 kbps MP3, 128 kbps OGG, 350 kbps OGG, and 16 bit WAV. The WAV file had a somewhat steeper difficulty curve compared to the lesser formats. All were significantly harder than anything played from YouTube.\n\nMusical genre has a large impact on the difficulty of the game. A track such as Current Value - Loner played on hardest difficulty will be significantly more challenging that something like Armin Van Buuren - Drowning. I'm not sure if this was an intentional design practice, or something that happened as a result of programming limitations, but either way you spin it, if you want to have the game be more challenging, play faster songs with more complex drum patterns.\n\nAll in all, it's a very fun game.

Use your own songs! This freedom is easily the best part of this game.\n    [*]The stages are abstract and can make it easy to focus on the music.  I personally prefer the type of stages you'd find in Beats Fever, but this is at least less likely to lag.\n    [*]Great optimizations and a professional level polish to the menu UI.  Everything is easy to understand and runs smoothly on both my Phenom II X4 955 and my Ryzen 1600X, though I find that the YouTube streaming hiccups a lot on my older hardware, pausing every 30-45 seconds to buffer.\n    [*]Recommendations seem to be on-point a lot of the time with fast-paced songs and songs which just sound really cool.  When I bought this, I kept telling myself I would use my own mp3 library, but I find it easier to just play the recommended songs from YouTube.  The YouTube songs often come with lyrics, too, which is a nice bonus.\n[/olist]\n\nCons: \n\n[olist]\n    [*]Note orbs often do not fit the music.  Note orbs move eradically, pausing for no particular reason and moving at different speeds to hinder your timing.  I prefer notes move toward you at a constant speed so I can plan ahead.\n    [*]The difficulty levels can be very hard or very easy and often not anywhere inbetween.  I found the game too easy and not fun enough unless I played in Harder or higher difficulty, but some songs aren't as accurate as others and the difficulty settings are there to help alleviate that.\n    [*]I found myself getting worn out trying to swing my arms into the right position to get the right color, because the colors of notes and their position are totally random.\n    [*]You're limited to just 3 stages, and they're mostly abstract scenery, aside from the concert stage, which is decidedly low quality.  I would like to see different levels of quality for each stage and more stages to choose from.  I'd be happy to pay for that as a DLC, too.\n    [*]There's no way to add your own custom note tracks for songs from what I can tell.  It would be really cool to see user-generated tracks for popular songs.\n[/olist]\n\nOverall, this game is great.  Audioshield gives me a lot more replay value than Beats Fever does.

For a rhythm game, it really has a hard time keeping the onscreen obstacles with the rhythm. \n\nI've seen reviews saying it crashes and freezes, I haven't had one issue with it so far, runs perfect for me. I've also seen reviews saying it's a great work out and you'll have sweat running down your face, maybe if you're in very poor shape, like don't normally move around much shape. \n\nThis is a game that is on the highest rated VR games and best sellers, so I maybe put a little too much stock in and set my expiations too high on the \"puts you at the point of impact for every hit in your music\" tag line. So that\u2019s what I was expecting, something that kept time and felt like I was visually playing the music. I tried popular music, recommended music from the game, most popular songs used, my own downloaded music and any every list in the game to see if it got any better. But it\u2019s only accurate when there\u2019s heavy beat with little to no other instruments or music in the song.\n\nWhen the song picks up, the game is just all over the place. Not really throwing the obstacles with the beat or rhythm, just throwing random balls and whatever as what I'm assuming is the software losing track of what's going on. That\u2019s what I\u2019m also assuming about this game, it\u2019s just trying to \u201cguess\u201d what to display on screen based on the song selected. But it seems like the software has a hard time trying to determine what to do most of the time and you just end up hitting random bubbles out of rhythm.\n\nAs most songs pick up you just find yourself playing a whack a mole game to a song you picked instead of an actual rhythm game. Usually in the intro and outro of most songs it keeps the beat and rhythm very well. Though, the game does substitute the lack of accuracy with the bubbles staying on beat with having the speed of them change with the tempo of the music, that's what the game does best in my opinion. \n\nBut the game is fun, even out of rhythm and beat you're often challenged with the left right left left oh right again, nope wrong color game play. As the bubble obstacles zoom in to your position you end up just reacting at times like something is actually coming at you, so the game does a very good job with the depth and feel of it all. \n\nI know it sounds like I\u2019m bashing the game, but don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy playing the game. I was having fun but something seemed off. That does hamper on the \u201cfun\u201d of it as you find yourself just punching randomness to a song you picked instead of going with the rhythm of the song you picked. \n\nDo I recommend this game? Sure\nDo I think it's a bit over rated? Definitely\n\nI'd give it a 7 out 10 for being a rhythm game that can't keep up with the real rhythm. \n", "timestamp_created": 1497656642, "timestamp_updated": 1497656642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620373368263244629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32448433": {"recommendationid": "32448433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079009910", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1492399926}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cool musical experience.", "timestamp_created": 1497552567, "timestamp_updated": 1497552567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32413921": {"recommendationid": "32413921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020445786", "num_games_owned": 1033, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1618677422}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]GAMEPLAY VIDEO:[/b] https://youtu.be/Cr0bD58vBqA\n[h1]30minVR[/h1] [url=steamcommunity.com/groups/30minvr][b]STEAM Group[/b][/url] / [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33700466/][b] STEAM Curator[/b][/url]\n\n[b]REVIEW:[/b]\nThe pioneering VR music rhythm game is still going strong even with the negative reviews it's getting since losing the YouTube intergration.

I was disappointed.\nPros:\n - Totally smooth on geforce 1080. Looks good; generous particle effects.\n - When everything syncs up, VR beat dance is a great idea, and fun.\n - Pretty cool that it can import youtube videos, though it takes a while and seems to be only some subset of youtube.\nCons:\n - The automatic beat inference is bad. I tried a bunch of different music, including just some random tunes I like, electronic music that I thought would be \"easy for it\", and the globally most popular tracks (which I figured must be good?). There were certainly moments where I felt the sequence matched the song well, but they didn't last long. Like sometimes you'd get to a point in the song that was obviously symmetric to something you just did, but the dot sequence would just be different.\n - Menus and things seem pretty unpolished. \"Change location\" button just didn't do anything. Post-game report is like an ascii-formatted text file that shows up in a text box. There is no introduction for first-time players; it just throws you into the song browser.\n - Seems like they could easily provide more environments, but there are only three, so I got bored of those pretty fast.\n - It's hard to get perfect scores, but I didn't find the game all that challenging even at the highest level; there's not much negative feedback if you miss hitting dots and you can't \"fail\" a song like in Guitar Hero. I would like to see it directly challenge me some more. It also could use the up/down dimension more on difficult sequences.

As soon as the feature to search for and use youtube videos for the game was removed the game went so downhill. This is a dead game to me and the fun exciting aspects of playing to your favorite songs are now frustrating and inaccessable as the only way to play to your own songs now is to upload mp3 files to the game which sucks as you have to get ahold of the mp3 files in the first place. additionally, you can no longer compete to your favorite songs as again they are now sourced from mp3 files on your computer instead of youtube videos. this means that even if you are playing the exact same song as someone else it will now show other people on the leaderboard since the files are technically different. Don't buy  this game. I'm so sorry to say that as this used to be my favorite game. If you want a more engaging option with more versatility beat saber is probably your best bet that I am aware of. \n\nOld review in case you would like to see my old opinions from around the beginning of this game:\n\nIf you are having second thoughts like I was about buying this game, don't.  I promise that you will not regret it.  The concept of this game may seem too short for $20, but trust me, it's not.  This is probably the most addicting VR game that I own because you can search youtube for literally any song or play one of the popular songs and try to get to the top of the leaderboard.\nTo sum this up (and make this review less tedious to read) here is a list of pros and cons with this game:\n\nPROS:\n-Super fun\n-Infinite new songs to play\n-Really good workout (there has actually been someone who has done a short study on how many calories you burn in vr games and this is one of those games that he did the study on.  Here is the link to the article that I found about it: https://uploadvr.com/best-htc-vive-games-excercise/     )\n-Wide veriety of difficulties: Casual, Normal, Hard, Harder, and Elite for any level of challenged and sweaty you want to be\n-You can rock out to the pokemon theme song along with my personal favorite, \"We Are Number One\"\n-The graphics and effects are really cool\n-There are pvarious types of shields and environments to fit your liking\n-You can search for a song from either in the game or from your computer with ease meaning if someone is trying it out you can set it up for them, or if you are alone and don't want to take your headset off to look at your computer you can just do a youtube search from inside the game\n-You can comete against others and get creative with your movements to earn more points\n\n\nCONS:\n-You can't play for as long as you probably would like to; it gets really tiring and you get really sweaty after a while.\n-As I said, this game can be really tiring if you are playing on a more intense difficulty.  If you hate moving this probably isn't for you, but even though it gets tiring it is so worth it and so fun\n-The sweat. Preare to have waterfalls coming down your nose.  You might have to take off the headset to wipe your face between games if you are playing on a hard dificulty.\n\nI've seen other people say that the notes aren't exactly in line with the song.  This is sortof true because it is auto-generated, so instead of the noted being in line with the lyrics I have noticed that they tend to be more in line with the actual notes, pitch, and volume.  This may sound bad if you havn't played the game, but this didn't really effect the expirience to me.  In fact, it sometimes even made the game more fun and made me feel more badass even thogh I deep down know that I probably look ridiculous in real life.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI 100% reccomend this game.  This is probably my favorite vr game, and that's going up against games like vanishing rhealms, the lab, rec room, the blu, and many others that I own and I've only had this game for a day or so! I Havn't found any problems that are too bad so far and I love, love, LOVE this game.\n\n\nPS: The only time I write long reviews is when I really like or dislike something.", "timestamp_created": 1492404278, "timestamp_updated": 1617577421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31184102": {"recommendationid": "31184102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000136781", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 725, "last_played": 1615135213}, "language": "english", "review": "The below review was written April 2017. YouTube support (probably my favorite feature) was dropped a while ago, so please see my comment below for some thoughts as of September 2019 (in short, I still recommend the game, though not quite as highly as I once did).\n\n---------\nAudioshield has overtaken our home.  For me and my roommates, this is the Vive killer app, and maybe it will be for you, too.\n\nLet's get the few minor cons out of the way, first:\n[list]\n    [*]As others have noted, in some songs the orbs sometimes sync up poorly with the music, making such songs borderline unenjoyable (i.e., it seems more like a random pattern than any kind of rhythm).\n    [*]I have not experienced this, but some players report that very rarely, the game does not correctly detect an orb being blocked (my roommate, obsessed with getting perfect scores, can attest to how frustrating this can be).\n    [*]The menu interface still has some minor glitches, and certain functions are difficult to navigate to or occasionally decide not to work at all (this does not affect the gameplay at all, though, only the menus).\n    [*]If you go to play a song on YouTube that has never been played before, the game must analyze the entire video before it is ready for you to play (though if someone else did play it at least once already, you can just start right away, which is the case with most popular songs).\n[/list]\n\nOkay, now on to the good stuff:\n[list]\n    [*]THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!  Find yourself some good songs where the orbs match up well (not that hard, I assure you; try some of the popular songs), crank up the difficulty, and jump in.  If you're a fan of rhythm games, you won't want to stop (seriously, as I write this I just finished a three-hour play session)!!\n    [*]Being able to connect to YouTube is a great feature.  Pretty much any song you could possibly think of is there for you to try, so you don't technically even need your own library, and it's easy to get lost in all the possibilities.\n    [*]The leaderboards! If you are even a little competitive, it can be a lot of fun challenging other people's scores.  And even if someone has a perfect score on a song, you can still \"dethrone\" them if you also get a perfect (though since it is possible to set up notifications when you get dethroned, don't think they won't try to take that top spot back).\n    [*]Like DDR before it, you will accidentally be getting a workout just by playing a video game... so this is definitely one game you don't have to feel guilty about getting addicted to.\n    [*]Like similar VR games (e.g. Space Pirate Trainer), this can be really fun to play locally with a group of friends taking turns (and guests can even put their own names in, to better keep track of scores).\n    [*]Lastly, the developer seems to be actively updating the game (adding new features, arenas, and so on), so as far as I can tell this game has a hopeful future ahead of it.\n[/list]\n\nAnd finally some neutral notes (whether these are pros or cons depends on your perspective):\n[list]\n    [*]Each playthrough of a song will be slightly different.  While the exact timing and amount of orbs in a given song never change, the placement (and even orb color) can change from one playthrough to the next (though for those so inclined, there is supposedly a mod that changes this so every playthrough is identical).\n    [*]The game scores you on both your technical ability (i.e., blocking every single orb), as well as your artistic ability (i.e., how much you move around to the music), and the technical score takes precendence on the leaderboards.  This means, for example, that someone with a perfect technical score of 10.00 but a terrible artistic score of 5.00 would still beat someone with an excellent technical score of 9.99 and a perfect artistic score of 10.00. A little unintuitive, I think, and good to be aware of if you want to top the leaderboards.\n    [*]Finally, you need a compatible VR headseat with motion controllers (duh, but... just in case).\n[/list]\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game to anyone who owns a VR headset and is a fan of rhythm games or working out to music.  Recognize that you may find some duds, but the songs that work really well (and again, there are a lot of them) make it all worth it.\n\nHope to see you on the leaderboards!! \u263a", "timestamp_created": 1492367236, "timestamp_updated": 1569598062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53416144847869873", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31150695": {"recommendationid": "31150695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983452355", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1526452635}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been superb, the cardio is amazing the music is great because its what ever you want to listen to!

I purchased Audiosurf a few years ago, and liked the aspect of a music-based game using your own music instead of preinstalled or proprietary tracks. It was a cool idea, but not a game I could play for hours on a controller. When I heard the same company created the same idea, but on a VR platform. I couldn't contain my excitement. The game is beautifully put together, and it's incredibly easy to navigate the menus which can be done via your monitor and mouse or the HMD and controllers.\n\nAllowing the usage of Youtube videos is a new feature that was not available in Audiosurf, but for those of you with weaker systems it should be known the youtube video plays in the background along with the orbs coming at your face which can easily put a strain on your GPU. If you've got an extensive library of popular songs though, you'll have no issue finding some competition on their leaderboards which will be visible to you before you launch your song. Once you complete a song, you can see how you compare with others globally, within your region (aka state in the US) or your Steam friends that also play. You can also add your email address which will notify you if you are ever bested in a song by another, and your position in the leaderboard shifts down.\n\nFinally, there are a TON of people claiming the orbs do not sync in time with the song. That is crap. The orbs do sync in time with the song, but they won't always sync on the downbeat or on the part of a song which you would probably anticipate. The algorithm the game uses will often produce orbs on subdivisions of beats. If you are a musician or have any sense of rhythm outside 1-2-3-4, then you'll easily be able to feel the orbs syncing up with the tempo of the song. That being said, if you play something like Merzbow on Audioshield, the algorithm will most likely produce orbs that seem sporadic. The best music I've found to play on Audioshield are things like EDM, dubstep, trap, trance, even bass heavy pop songs. Post-hardcore & screamo music works well, too.\n\nAs stated, this game is awesome, but everyone should know before purchase that this IS AN ACTIVE GAME. You will be moving your arms around A LOT! Especially as you progress into the higher difficulties. If you are into your music like I am,  you will probably even find yourself stepping or jumping in time with the music also. You can easily wear yourself out by getting lost in the music. Remember to wear your controller straps, take breaks after every 1-3 songs and be sure to keep your HMD dry of sweat.", "timestamp_created": 1491913142, "timestamp_updated": 1491914831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31071682": {"recommendationid": "31071682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045498391", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1160, "last_played": 1579799295}, "language": "english", "review": "I use AudioShield regularly for a bit of exercise in the morning.\n\nI really enjoy having access to my own music, as well as any music I can find on YouTube. \n\nFor a fun workout, I would recommend Lindsey Stirling's Roundtable Rival, Lindsey Stirling & Peter Hollens' Skyrim, Two Steps From Hell's Cannon in D Minor, Orff's Carmina Burana, or Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain.

A nice touch I always enjoy is that when the tempo kicks up, the angle of the orbs changes to start coming at you from further up.\n\nI wish there was a difficulty between Normal and Harder. Normal just seems to have fewer orbs, which can kind of kill the mood for a song you really like when you aren't getting to hit on all the beats. The Harder difficulty, though it is much fuller, also throws in a lot of orb setups that require you to cross your arms. The jump in coordination required is huge.\n\nI would like it if they could add more arena environments to play in, more shield shapes, and maybe a customization menu that allows you to set the color scheme of the orbs and shields.\n\nI'd also like options that give you a more granular control over the gameplay, such as how often you're required to cross your arms, how wide the spread of orbs is, and maybe even an option to turn on a 360 degree approach of the orbs.\n\nAll criticisms aside, the feeling of playing this game is incredible.

It is from the developers of Audiosurf, and it shows. You can choose any song you have access to locally, from soundcloud, or from Youtube. It also appears that your \"friends favorites\" are from your Youtube friends, not people that have specifically purchased the game. \n\nThe game itself is a simple premise. You choose a song, ball-things appear and you hit them with the correct color shield, blue on the left hand and ORANGE on the right (the game says red, but I see orange dammit). The ball-things have been on beat to the music on the songs I've played so far (from Youtube). There appears to be five levels of difficulty, but two (casual and legacy hard) are separated from the other three. I'm not sure what all changes with the different difficulties, but so far all of them have been a blast. There are also three different shield shapes, with one even being more a backhand shield (I kept having to force myself to hold the controller correctly, instead of cheating).\n\nWhat I wasn't expecting though, was the scoring. There's a \"technical\" and \"artistic\" score. The artistic score seems to entail \"how into the music you are.\" In other words, the more you bob, the stronger your punches (yes this measures punch strength when popping the ball-things), the higher the artisc score. The technical score is how many times you hit the ball-thing with the correct shield.\n\nI haven't spent much time with this game yet, but I love rhythm games, and at this point I've seen what I need to see.

Im a big fan of DDR, Guitaro Hero, Stepmania, Cytus, Dance Central, Fantasia, and other such music games that bring my enjoyment of the songs to a new level. These kinds of games make the music feel more alive, it makes you feel part of it. So when I first heard of audioshield I knew right away I would be buying it, and It could potentially go beyond and be better than any music game ever. \n\nSad to say, all of the games I mentioned are far better than audioshield. And what do they have that audioshield doesnt? On point beats/rythm. I am not a expert musician or game designer, but you dont have to be in order to realize that the red/blue/purple beats coming at your face is not at all lined up with the songs (at least the majority of the time).\n\nWhen you play other rythm games it makes you kinda dance or put your energy into the beats, it almost energizes you. A good song makes the game funner, and a good stage/level makes the song better. With audioshield though, it makes both feel worse. As I was playing the game I tried to make the color blasts match, I would try punching the blasts with my shield but that doesnt match, and many colors are long rifts which also doesnt match like it should. Then I try just blocking the blasts, which probably is the easiest way to go if you want to be accurate with the game, but this way is even less fun/engaging and it completely changes the game from a music beat type of game, to some bland, bargain bin, color matching game, the music just becomes backround noise if you play it this way.\n\nLong story short, I decided after about 10 different songs that this game sucks, its in a way broken, because it doesnt do what it sets out to do. It shouldnt be called audio shield, it should just be called Music Visualizer VR. And one other thing I must mention. If this game was 5 dollars I would still want my refund, because it is not fun or worth the money. But this game is 20 dollars?! WHY?!\n\nThis is an example of a good idea that was POORLY executed. Hopefully another dev will take this idea and expand upon it in a way that is more accurate to the beat, and better bang for its buck, because this is nothing but a glorified music player visualizer.", "timestamp_created": 1485870826, "timestamp_updated": 1485871020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484545081853866577", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29603679": {"recommendationid": "29603679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966991994", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1004, "last_played": 1601079238}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Great game for the Vive", "timestamp_created": 1485863187, "timestamp_updated": 1485863187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29594278": {"recommendationid": "29594278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072184655", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 878, "last_played": 1616058798}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had my vive about a month now and thought I would be mainly interested in the slasher/fighting type games.

Because of it, it is very difficult to keep up with the moves because they don't match the natural time of the music.  It feels this way for most songs, I've only found a handful that are perfectly timed, poppy and fun.\n\nIt's very interruptive as well having to wait to start or wait to end, pick a new song takes time and a lot of songs the timing is lagged.  It looks like the song synced well but the beats stutter...  Freeze up and then suddenly come flying at you.

The main issue I mentioned below (bad tracking causing missed notes) is infuriating at upper levels of this game. I've played Sound Boxing quite a bit now as well and it doesn't suffer from this problem, which leads me to believe it's not a problem with the Vive hardware.\n\nFirst off, the scoring system is horrible. The game scores you based on accuracy and 'style', both on a 0-10 scale. Accuracy is the main attribute that will determine where you rank on a leaderboard, and if you're tied for accuracy then it will come down to how the game judges your 'style'. Trying to get/maintain a high score is a very frustrating process when the game fails to track the controllers and it mostly turns into a matter of luck.\n\nSecond, the 'style' is not actually a 0-10 scale as the game would lead you to believe. It's possible to get above a 10, although you have no way to actually tell what the true value is. Trying to beat a high score that is some unknown amount higher than yours is a frustrating process.\n\nI really like the concept behind this game, and love the ability to generate a level based on any song you choose (unlike Sound Boxing, which people have to create levels on). I still get one hell of a workout when I get into it, but trying to get a high score isn't fun.\n\nOld review:\n\nAudioshield is hands-down my favorite game (so far) on the Vive. I was always a sucker for rhythm games and this is tickling that itch while also being a productive workout tool. I actually bought a Fitbit to track heartrate because I was curious how well this was working, and this easily gets me above 100 BPM and up to 150 on some songs (e.g. metal).\n\nI have two complaints with the game, though it's nothing I can't work around:\n\n-If you're punching notes too fast, it's possible to miss. I imagine this is due to controller tracking, but it can be annoying if you care about getting that 100%\n-The game does not handle long tracks very well. By long, I'm talking about one hour or more.

In my opinion, it's worth a buy both as a fun diversion (who doesn't love punching music in the face?) and an actual fitness tool.\n\nFirst, the biggest complaint I see people making when they first try the game (and a claim often made in refunds) is that the rhythm at which the blue and orange balls come in doesn't match the song. That's actually true only if you try to \"catch\" the balls - which is not how you're supposed to play. You don't catch the notes in Audioshield - you punch them!\n\nAlthough it's not obvious, the beat track is generated such that it expects you to be punching the note with an extended arm from a standing position, not \"catching it\" a second later. That's why the beat track may seem off if you try to intercept the notes at your chest, rather than punching the note while it approaches. Once you figure *that* out, and you start to time your left/right punches with the beat, all of the sudden the game stops being a diversion and becomes an actual zenlike trance. Your punches match the beat and you start having a really good time.\n\nObviously, as with other rhythm games, the difficulty level you choose will affect how many beats get thrown at you at once. If you start out on the lowest difficulty, this also lends to the feeling that the beat tracks aren't completely synced, as it purposely drops notes so as not to overwhelm you. Once you're ready to tackle Elite difficulty (which I believe is the most fun) you're getting tracks that match your chosen song beat for beat, and give you a good workout besides.\n\nAs far as fitness goes, what makes Audioshield so good is that, once you start punching all the beats as they fly toward you, you start burning calories like nobody's business. Granted, a Fitbit is not a precise tool, but there's been times when I've burned 600 calories in maybe 50 minutes of play. Obviously, YMMV depending on whether you're punching fast or slow songs, and your difficulty level, but the biggest benefit of Audioshield is it keeps me entertained while I work out.\n\nI've tried exercise bikes, treadmills, and other devices for cardio while watching TV, and I get bored quickly. But I can easily punch music in Audioshield for an hour and the time flies by. Honestly, sometimes I have to make myself stop.\n\nAs far as music, anything works, whether local files or right off Youtube. I have a ton of MP3s and prefer those, but I do stream songs off Youtube on occasion without issue. Finally, while Elite difficulty will make any song at least a bit challenging, there are certainly songs that are more fun than others (seriously, play just about anything by Blue Man Group and you'll have a good time). Anything with a strong beat is ideal, as the beat track comes off drums/percussion.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy listening to music, rhythm games, punching music, or who just want a fun way to burn some calories while punching along to their favorite songs.\n\nRemember!

The general gameplay idea is fine, but there are some issues:\n\n- This game lacks features. It's one minigame sold for an high price. You're paying an HUGE VR premium. There are no hand made tracks, menus are as minimal as possible (looking for a specific track is hell, expecially on YouTube), there's a lack of costumization in the challenge and a lack of different \"hazards\" (boosting the difficulty just adds more spheres overall, there are no added challenges like spheres to avoid or to never touch);\n- Hard mode is cheap: most of the times I miss spheres just because they appear out of sight.\n- This is the most common complaint: the spheres basically NEVER follow the rhythm. The game rewards you for catching the spheres with strength, which is fine, but since they never seem to follow the song, most of the time you find yourself just parrying them because hitting them is pure luck.\n- To add to the last complaint, the spheres change speed on the fly which, together with the \"the song and the spheres are not on the same rhythm\" complaint, forces the player to passively parry the spheres, which kinda defeats the purpose of a music game.\n\nIt's a fine game but for its features is worth way less than it's price (I bought it at 15\u20ac).", "timestamp_created": 1483026807, "timestamp_updated": 1483026807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518381416797637939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28788204": {"recommendationid": "28788204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978524605", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1593774761}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily my favorite game in VR, love that you can play from YouTube.

Combine them to make a purple sheild.\nNow get ready for balls to rain down from the heavens as you fight them off (in color coordinated fasion). \nWhile the controls and concept of the game is simple, it still offers a great challenge with the patterns and song choice (higher BPM's and complex rhythms step the game up).

For casuals, normal is usually better than casual, although if it's granny smiths first time, maybe reconsider. 10/10\n\nSound: Havent had a problem with sound so far.

This is a game to just have fun and let loose. Sometimes before a jog, i'll punch all the balls in a boxers stance as  a warm up on high BPM songs.

I played 10+ year on drums, and a little on guitar. I got 200+ hour in guitar hero 3, and i listen a lot of music every day. So this was my #1 VR game on my whislist.\n\nAnd its a reall good concept, but sadly the game itself is pretty .. \"meh\". The idea is 10/10, the graph and other stuffs are a solid  8/10, but the algorithm for the youtube songs is preatty bad, like 3/10 bad (there is some song that actually not bad, but most of the time its just nonsens randomness. By the way i mostly use it for rock/metal so its maybe better on pop/electro). I have programming experience, so I know its hard to write a good algorithm that you can use on every youtube vid, but still it could be a LOT better than this.\n\nWell thats my big concerne, but there are a lot of small things that could be better:\n\n-The shileds hitbox is not 100%. I have an older PC so i only have 45 fps at best so maybe thats the reason, but sometimes the sound blobs just pass through my shield. (like 1% of the time)\n\n-The blobs come way to high. I noticed that the higher the sound the higher the blubs, but it just constant high. It need to start lower, and incrase less for the sound. I cant do more than 1-2 song at the time because my neck start to hurt. Its like watching an IMAX movie from the first line.\n\n-If you start the youtube video instantly after loading in to the \"chamber\" the first 1-2 sec is totally fucked up. So you need to wait like 10 sec every time after loading before you actually can start.\n\n-custom shields and maps would be nice.\n\n-A little less cross boxing would be nice. I play on hard and expert (or whatever its called) and there is a lot of time when you have to box x-cross with your hands. Its not really a good way to incrase difficulty. Give us more and faster blobs, but not this crossboxing thing.\n\n\nI hope they gonna do something with the algorithm. If they do i would never stopp playing it.\n\n(PS: Sory for my grammar.

It works with so many different genres of music (I've tried classical, rock, jazz, film scores, Disney...) and the only one that didn't work quite so well was techno, as the algorithm struggles a bit with the music's \"stuttery\" nature, messing up its reading of the tempo.

So while I need to focus, I can play with an \"aggressive style\" (ample and fast punch on each bubble) to get a good artistic score. Not the most efficient way to do that, but that's how I achieve my best feelings of power and merging with the music.\n- \"Elite\" mode is great if I want a technical challenge. Rarely a perfect hit score (close though), but now I mostly play that anyway.\n\nSome points that would need improvement in my view:\n- I don't like pauses in the flow, and sometimes generated patterns are not so good. Though current modes cannot be tweaked without messing up the score rankings.\n- Maybe for a new mode/game, instead of \"artistic\" score I'd like one that promote punch power on each bubble. Not just impact speed, but also requiring an ample movement.\n- File exploration could be improved, to also list a few information about the track. For example my best score in selected mode.\n- Would like the ability to create/share playlists/bookmarks.

That's pretty dang important for a game.\n-Lets you listen to any song you want!\n-Works well, didn't encounter too many bugs, if any.\n-A nice physical activity game that doesn't involve TOO much physical activity. You keep active, but it's not as exhausting as something like Dance Dance Revolution (unless of course you play the hard modes in which case you're a maniac). I like to start my day with it from time to time to wake me up and get the blood flowing.\n-Good game that you can just hop into, play for a few minutes, then hop out if you want. Which also makes it good for showing it to friends.\n\nCONS:\n-I'm not sure why but the sprites in this game (The orbs, if you will) are blurry.\n-If you play a song from the internet who's file you don't already have on your computer, and nobody's ever played it before, the game will take a while (as long as the duration of the song, to be percise) to \"Create\" the level for it.\n-The computer generated levels are usually pretty good, but they are random and are based on the computer's understanding of what the song is like. This leaves me sorely wanting a level editor, so that people can make levels based on actual choreography or the flow of the song, rather than just procedurally generated beats and long notes.\nPlus it would help minimize the time when notes sneak on you by hiding behidn other notes, or by showing up on the opposite edge of the play area than where you're facing.\n-No ability to see how well you did previous times on a level.\n-It seems fairly easy to get a score above 9 on normal mode, regardless of how good you are. The actual difference is usually in the numbers after the decimal point.\n-I wanted to record this game for a Youtube video but the desktop display of it is portrait oriented, rather than landscape for some reason. Not easy to record.\n\nFinal verdict: Fun. Simple. Needs more features in my opinion, but worth buying if it's on sale or if you're really into this sort of game.", "timestamp_created": 1479636206, "timestamp_updated": 1479636252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610427498817443848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26704647": {"recommendationid": "26704647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084288286", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1195, "last_played": 1529064435}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a huge fan of Audiosurf since I got my hands on the first one, the idea of a dynamic rhythm game in which you can load your own audio files has always captivated me. Audioshield is no exception.\n\nThough most will have you believe that the Youtube update killed the game, that's not the case. Though admittedly it did negatively impact it, as I've not even been able to get that part of the game to work, and I definitely miss the days when I could just play something from Soundcloud, it made it a ton easier for those of us in the underground EDM scene, where tracks we like aren't always on Youtube.\n\nHowever, the game still gives you just as much freedom with the ability to load in your own files. If you're a fan of Audiosurf 1 or 2, you'll be familiar with this system, as the interface is identical to Audiosurf 2 (same dev). I'm not sure how much the the algorithm has changed, but I can say it feel very fluid and accurate. Though some songs with a lot of complicated rhythms can be a bit difficult to play, it's still very fun. Me and my family have spent countless hours playing this, laughing at each other's and our own mistakes in the game and trying to beat each other's scores. The game also offers to change who is playing on the PC side, allowing for guests to keep separate scores than the owner of the account. It's very active, and even encourages players to be more so with the \"Physical Activity\" score.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're looking for a good rhythm game for the Vive, this is about the best there could be (excluding the bad Youtube implementation and removal of Soundcloud). A must have if you love music and own a Vive.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1479611713, "timestamp_updated": 1479611713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26700366": {"recommendationid": "26700366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028229358", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1514304712}, "language": "english", "review": "A must-have! \n\nMultiplayer mode would be be nice ;)", "timestamp_created": 1479592334, "timestamp_updated": 1479592334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26699876": {"recommendationid": "26699876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046926989", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1638477098}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun if you have a solid library of music, even with youtube it is a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1479590565, "timestamp_updated": 1479590565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26667005": {"recommendationid": "26667005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025560976", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1522331737}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun, best rythm game so far on HTC Vive.", "timestamp_created": 1479449535, "timestamp_updated": 1479449535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26611508": {"recommendationid": "26611508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035257129", "num_games_owned": 684, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1781, "last_played": 1619656941}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty amazing and simple game.", "timestamp_created": 1479193974, "timestamp_updated": 1479193974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26566498": {"recommendationid": "26566498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070244961", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1640625205}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the only reason I'm keeping my Vive.

Beat detection is really bad in this game, it works only for certain type of music (techno, house, anything like that with a steady beat). As a comparison I have a game called Audiosurf and beat detection in that game is much better. I was hoping for a kind of \"dance-and-play\" game, but it just doesn't deliver.

They probably said \"Give us the game or we will shut off access to Youtube for it\" >>> Funny part is, Google is owned by liberals, who are SUPPOSED to agree with the idea that 'poor people need more equality\"... yet, them basically stomping on these devs proves that all they really care about is MONEY and nothing else. \n\nMan, what a joke. Thanks, Google for ruining a really good VR game because your selfish BS got in the way of letting people have fun. Remind me to never buy a Google product again, oh wait, you just did.\n\n\n----OLD REVIEW---\\/\n\n9.3/10 - In my opinion the best VR game available for the Vive.\n\nPROS:\nThe replay value of this game is very very high (which is very very rare among VR games nowadays). You can try new songs over and over by picking from your audio/video collection on your hard drives, or you can even search for a YouTube video and play it. Every time you play the same song, the same orbs will come in the exact same pattern, so you can play songs until you master them, or just pick new songs every time. \n\nThe competitive online aspect of this game is also very high, as any popular song has a leaderboard. The leaderboard is different whether it comes from your hard drive or from YouTube, but there is a leaderboard to compete against on any popular song either way. I even found that some of my favorite songs by relatively unpopular artists (by bands like Opeth, or Infected Mushroom) had one or two people to compete agains on the leaderboards.\n\nOut of all the games I've played for VR since I got my Vive a couple of weeks ago, this one seems to give you the most exercise WITHOUT the chance of hitting objects in your real life space, or tangling/unplugging a cord in the process.\n\nI was skeptical of this game before I purchased it that the orbs wouldn't be in sync enough with the music to enjoy it. I was very wrong. They obviously have a pretty advanced algorithm for making the gameplay match certain notes in the song. The harder the difficulty you choose, the more the orbs go to the song. Of course on easy mode its hard to see how the notes are going to the song, but thats beacause easy mode is there to teach you, not to make you feel like you're part of the song.\n\nAnd the best part about this game is, even when you master a song, and can hit 100% of the notes, you get an 'Artistic' score. I have found that this is based on how you are moving in correlation to the rhythm of the song. When I am jumping around and dancing to the song while blocking the orbs, I get a much higher artistic score than if I were just standing there carefully blocking the orbs as they come.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nThe feeling of personal achievement and progression is very limited with this game. You can compare yourself to other players that just so happened to play the same song from the same source (HDD mp3 ID tag/YouTube), but it ends there. There is no 'campaign' type system in place that you have to beat in order to progress.\n\nThere are no tiers to see how well you scored (like all the good rythym games have in place). A star system (1-5) stars would make this game more endearing, but unfortunately it just has a score for your % of notes hit, and a modifier for Artistic value (If i hit 100% of the notes I get a 10.0, and can only surpass other 10s on the leaderboard by having a higher artistic value)\n\nThere seems to be a bug with some songs that make it almost impossible to hit all the notes at the start because of a bpm change that somehow basically superspeed rush a bunch of notes at you so fast that its impossible to block them. It seems like a bug and I'm sure it will be fixed eventually. \n\n\n----------\n\nWhat I think should be added to this game: \n\n* A campaign mode that the devs made with songs they chose, where you can actually fail a song if you miss too many notes too fast (like GH/RB), and cant continue to the next few songs until you pass 2/3 or 3/4 of the songs in that tier. \n\n* A campaign builder mode where you can make your own setlist (with only YouTube songs, to make it easier to program) and upload it that follows the same rules as the devs campaign; you have to beat the songs in order and not fail, in order to unlock the next songs in the setlist. \n\n* A list of recently played songs (24 hours?) by every Audioshield user. This would encourage people to try out and be expsed to new songs that people have already played, so they're guaranteed to have at least one person to compete against.\n\n* A star power type system that you can get by hitting difficult note streaks that either makes your shields bigger or makes both shields able to block either color note for a short period of time. \n\n* User imported arenas/Arena Builder mode\n\nAnyways, this game is the epitome of fun, and it really allows you to thoroughly enjoy all your favorite music on a whole new level.", "timestamp_created": 1476818047, "timestamp_updated": 1539254226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26101519": {"recommendationid": "26101519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310745681", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1587872642}, "language": "japanese", "review": "MOD\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u540c\u3058\u66f2\u3067\u3082\u98fd\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u6d0b\u697d\u3001\u90a6\u697d\u3068\u308f\u305a\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u597d\u304d\u306a\u66f2\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304c\u826f\u3044\u306d\u3002\n\u30b5\u30d3\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u8b5c\u9762\u304c\u30ba\u30ec\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3092\u6319\u3052\u3066\u308b\u3068\u6c17\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u904b\u52d5\u306b\u3082\u306a\u308b\u3057\u3001\u6b4c\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3084\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3068\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u89e3\u6d88\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1476800521, "timestamp_updated": 1476800521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505703389644622803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26095819": {"recommendationid": "26095819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026088169", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 680, "last_played": 1593834220}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing update!

Very Tron-esque.\n[*]I didn't have any problems with stability, kept a buttery smooth 90fps during gameplay. I did get some dropped frames when I started tweaking supersampling, but that isn't a fault of the game.\n[*]It's a damn good workout.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]In the grey area between a roomscale and standing experience. Not knocking the game at all here, works fine as is.\n[*]Beats are generated based on an algorithm, the game scans the audio file and generates orbs accordingly. While ususally this works pretty well, there is some definite room for improvement. Understandably a lot of songs don't match up well on base difficulty. Faster paced songs having orbs matched to every beat could easily overwhelm new players on lower difficulty. That being said, some songs even on harder difficulty don't match up like you would hope. The option to play hand keyed music would be great.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Huge lack of quality songs from the default online resource (Soundcloud). You will run into a lot of bad remixes of songs you actual want to play. If you have a well stocked Google Play Music account I would highly recommend [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4tbso3/use_audioshield_with_google_play_music_v30/] the Audioshield-PlayMusic mod. [/url] It's a proxy server mod that replaces Soundcloud support with Play Music support. This game would really flourish with support for Spotify, and Play Music out of the box.\n[*]Song selection interface is poop.\n[*]No way to see song length from menu. Would be very nice to know before you start an epic 10 minute+ song. This can be very exhausting on hard/harder difficulties.\n[*]No Workshop support. Game only has 2 stages, and they get very old. Also handkeyed music would be a godsend, as mentioned in the neutral section.\n[*]Searching for songs in-game is a chore, though this is more the fault of the steam virtual keyboard than the game itself.

In comparison, the content of this VR experience is light for $20.  The price is acceptable ONLY because the VR game  market is so thin, and filled with so many pitfalls, that this game stands out as somewhat quality in comparison.  That's not really a vote in the plus column for this game as it is a sigh of disappoint for the current state of VR as of writing this review, but there it is...\n\nIn my opinion, Audioshield is more striking just above what I'd consier a minimum bar of quality.  A more fair price point for this game, based on it's mechanics and level of depth, would be about $5.  If this game wasn't VR, and was a trypical \"flat\" game, you'd probably be some free bowser based game with a lot more depth.  Just looking at the game from a mechanic standpoint, you will find it has trouble syncing with a lot of songs, and it's missing some cool obvious features such as letting users create their own modified song syncs to share with friends, etc. \n\nThe graphics are \"ok\", not great, definatley not polished like The Lab.  There are only two scenes to listen / interact music with, when there could easily be more.  There's no kind of actual progression, no co-op, it's really just a bare bones experince.  In my time with the game, it also crahed often, sometimes forcing me to restart SteamVR.  \n\nStill, given the rough state of many VR titles, I'm going to thumb this game up.  With all the negatives above, it is still immersive and fun.  When you load up one your personal favorite music scores, and you get into that virutal world that doens't seem at all that interesting in flat videos on the store poge, you'll find a TOTALLY different world and expereince in VR.  Then kicks in the highs and lows of yoru favorite song, and honestly, you could be in for a surprisingly  emotional experience.  It's prtobably just the music of your favorite track thundering in the background  ...but either way, it's about that time you might think this game was maybe actually worth the $20.  \n\nIt's also worth mentionging this is the kind of game tha draws in non-gamers, such as your mother in-law, etc.  Just load up their favroite song, and watch them be wow'd to the immersion of VR.  The clear excersize / activity you have to extert playing the game is also a fairly good ground for buying it, just for health.  For these reasons, this game really is a worthwhile purchase even at $20.

I think it is ambitious, and has great potential. Before buying my vive, I greatly anticipated playing this title. It was one of my first purchases of vive software. My reference point is that of a musician. I'm a professional violinist, orchestra director and educator. Music is my life, and what I do for a living. \n\nI quickly have become disilutioned with this title, for one main reason. I feel that the \"punches and pulses\" should be curated for the best rhythm punching experience possible, but they are not. From what I have read and experienced by playing, the punching of beats is generated randomly. \n\nThis makes for an often very bizzarre experience, that does not line up with the music very well.  \n\nI wish the developers of Audioshield would add a method for the community to custom make punches (Like the Bethesda community), or have the developers create a library of curated songs, the game is just not worth spending time with. \n\nTo recap:\n\nThe pros:\nGreat concept (if it worked)\nAwesome visual effects\nCool left and right shields, feel great and look awesome\n\nThe cons:\n-Most or all of the music is OUT OFSYNC with the beat puching\n-Punching is generated randomly\n-There is not currently a way for the community to create custom beat puches and movements\n\nI would be one of the first people creating beats for the game, I'm sure the game would get much more popularity if the community could have a creative avenue with content generation for the game. \n\nUntil these issues are addressed, I suggest to save your money and wait for the updates.", "timestamp_created": 1469578229, "timestamp_updated": 1469578229, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579888999462127686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24543560": {"recommendationid": "24543560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036599304", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1302, "last_played": 1642547253}, "language": "english", "review": "Best reason to exercise in the morning EVER!

Songs with hard hitting notes that are defined, with percussion that is clear works the best. Music that has a lot of background noise (i.e. Classic Rock) doesn't work as well, and the notes will seem more random. The algorythm could be better in that sense. However, when the system works, with the whole song having the orbs on point, it is very, very fun.\n\n\nCons:\n-No streaming services (what was the best part about the game)\n\n\nOverall I find the game very enjoyable, and I can forgive that the orbs aren't always 100% accurate to the notes, but it is good enough for me. Moments when songs are intence and the orbs line up perfectly are very satisfying, and I always work myself into a sweat trying to get a high artistic score.

Yes it looked entertaining, and I do love music, but there is a plethora of things to shoot on the Vive. So I eventually got around to playing this and if it weren't for being on call, and the fact that it's 2 am, I would put that sweat dripping Vive back on for more. I'm fairly certain I would play this game till I collapsed from exhaustion (it would be hilarious trying to explain to work why I was unable to report in), it is that entertaining.

I'm an Audioshield addict.\n\nWhat really swung it was the moment I bothered to transfer my music collection over to the computer with the HTC Vive on it. Fending off incoming music blobs to your favourite tunes is so very more-ish.\n\nThat said, I would like to point out that somewhere between the first and second times I played Audioshield, the leaderboards and global music menu stopped working. So when I tried it that first time I could pick from a selection of songs that other Audioshield users had \"battled\" their way through, when I came back I couldn't get to that menu and basically had to select songs from my computer's hard drive instead. Of course, since these aren't known to Audioshield, you can never compare your performance against anyone else. (So all the leaderboards stay completely blank.)\n\nIf one of the devs reads this and can suggest what might have gone wrong and how I can get back the global menu / leaderboard, I'd really appreciate it. (Not that I think I'm any good at Audioshield, but it would be fun to see how my performances compare with others around the world...)\n\nAll in all, this is the first game for the Vive that I could see myself playing on a daily basis to get some much needed exercise whilst revisiting my music collection... the latter having not received proper attention in many years due to the advent of podcasts! ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1468624968, "timestamp_updated": 1468624968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502233564853668213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24337298": {"recommendationid": "24337298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283164371", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1504371120}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u542c\u7740\u81ea\u5df1\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u5c31\u662f\u52a0\u5206\u9879\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0a\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u542c\u6b4c\u3002\u3002\u3002\u597d\u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1468601937, "timestamp_updated": 1468601937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24333953": {"recommendationid": "24333953", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991112580", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1512875261}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a lot more that can be done with this game, but there hasn't been an update for months. \n\nAlgorithmic beatmatching is wonky, and the UI is barebones and awfully glitchy. \nThere aren't any additional stages aside from the two that are included, and the lack of workshop support is a missed opportunity.\n\nParticle effects are nice, and it runs pretty well, but I can't recommend this seeing as the dev just split without supporting his game.", "timestamp_created": 1468589257, "timestamp_updated": 1468589257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527975320816040039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24333489": {"recommendationid": "24333489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016763999", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1611919638}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u8010\u73a9\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u953b\u70bc\u8eab\u4f53\u795e\u5668\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u624b\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u594f\u63a5\u7403\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u97f3\u4e50\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u635f\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u770b\u89c6\u9891\u89c9\u5f97\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u8d77\u6765\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1468587273, "timestamp_updated": 1468587273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556962013244628906", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24329567": {"recommendationid": "24329567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309455037", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2753, "last_played": 1637039273}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6839\u636e\u8282\u594f \u9ad8\u4f4e\u97f3 \u97f3\u7b26\u6765\u589e\u52a0 \u4e50\u611f\u5417\u3001\uff1f\u660e\u660e\u5c31\u662f   \u770b\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1468568379, "timestamp_updated": 1468568379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24329121": {"recommendationid": "24329121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971358653", "num_games_owned": 717, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1482770109}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see myself putting alot of time into this game.

Ce n'est pas que le jeu soit particuli\u00e8rement facile, j'ai loup\u00e9 quelques boules (quoique pas sufissamment pour avoir commenc\u00e9 direct en difficult\u00e9 max), mais je ne ressent rien en jouant. Moi qui aime les jeux de jeux de rythme, je suis souvent emport\u00e9 par la musique, avec un vrai sentiment d'accomplissement quand je suis bien le rythme, mais l\u00e0 bah rien.\nLa faute surement \u00e0 deux ou trois choses :\n\nLe rythme n'est pas clair ou pas rescpect\u00e9, l'impact des boules sur le bouclier ne se fait pas toujours en rythme, mais avec les contr\u00f4leurs du vive, ce n'est peut-\u00eatre pas si \u00e9tonnant. Ce genre de jeu demandant un certain timing pr\u00e9cis, tout d\u00e9pends d\u00e8s lors de l'endroit o\u00f9 la boule s'\u00e9crase. Selon si on l'arr\u00eate \u00e0 bout de bras ou au plus pr\u00e8s du corps, le timing ne sera pas le m\u00eame. Le seul moyen d'avoir un rythme parfait serait de ne pas bouger et de garder les contr\u00f4leurs toujours \u00e0 la m\u00eame distance. Mais alors dans un cas, \u00e7a ferait tr\u00e8s mal aux bras rapidement, et dans l'autre ce serait tout simplement inint\u00e9ressant.\n\nLe second point, c'est que les vibrations des controlleurs ne sont pas assez puissantes. Ce n'est pas la faute du jeu j'imagine, mais j'aimerais sentir d'avantage l'impact des boules sur les boucliers.\n\nEt le troisi\u00e8me, c'est que la musique n'a pas de \"sur ou sous notes\". J'entends par l\u00e0 que l'on entends pas les notes qui sont r\u00e9ussies, ce qui m'emp\u00eache de \"sentir\" la musique.\n\nAh puis une autre d\u00e9faut assez r\u00e9dhibitoire, c'est que les boules arrivent trop souvent en hauteur, ce qui fait que l'on passe le plus clair de son temps \u00e0 lever la t\u00eate, et le cou finit vite par en souffrir, notamment \u00e0 cause du poids du casque, qui, s'il n'est pas significatif en conditions d'utilisation normale, se fait sentir quand on doit lever les yeux au ciel en permanence. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela le poids d'un casque audio, \u00e7a devient vite d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able.\n\nBref, l'id\u00e9e de base du jeu est honorable, mais je pense honnet\u00eament que ce genre n'est pas adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 la VR, en tout cas pas de cette fa\u00e7on. A la limite si on jouait une batterie virtuelle fa\u00e7on Rock Band, \u00e7a marcherait, les caissons seraient fixes, donc pas de d\u00e9-syncrhonisation espace-rythme.\nSi vous cherchez un bon jeu de rythme, passez votre chemin et attendez un truc plus r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.", "timestamp_created": 1467332748, "timestamp_updated": 1467332748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600503683090209961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23966892": {"recommendationid": "23966892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060215020", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1466728804}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really great idea and I wish I could recommend it but I just can't, mainly because I'm a rhythm game junkie.\n\nEven the songs that aren't from my library or not on the internet radio that they play off of, the notes just aren't in sync.

Render distance has a bit to be desired, but it isn't bad.\nImmersive.  Play with the volume up, and you feel like you're there.\nGreat use of depth.  Never hurts your eyes to focus on something getting closer or further.\nThe orbs line up with the music!  I'm a drummer, so I was concerned about this before purchasing.  In fact, it lines up very well and catches subtle differences (it will have you hit on the E, And, and UH of a beat, if the songs has an accent there!)\nIt's a workout!  I'm sure this could be used as a workout tool for anybody struggling to get motivation to get to a gym.\nDecent UI and explorer interface.  Not too complicated.  I'd recommend moving it back a little bit from the user though.  It gets annoying to move my whole head just to see a different song.\n\nCons:\nUI is too close when selecting songs.\nMore of a question than a con, but if you're short, do you have to hold your hands up higher, or do the orbs fly to where the headset is located?  May be an issue for short people.\nCould be the vive, and probably is, but every once in a while I get tracking issues.\n\nIn conclusion, try this game out!

If you're not really fit, you're not going to do very well.  I've had some physical conditions that limits my movements a bit (probably by only 10% at most) so for me this game is quite difficult.  \n\nFirst off, basically you stand in the marked spot and hold the two vive controllers  in the appropriate hand and those become shields. One blue and one \"red\" (looks more orange to me).  When a blue blob flies toward you, you block it with the left hand, and when a red blob flies toward you, you block it with your right.  Occasionally a big purple blob flies at you and for that you put both hands together to make a big purple shield.\n\nSounds relatively simple right?  Well, it seems to me like the game likes to throw blue blobs on your right hand side and red blobs on your left hand side (requiring a big reach to hit it in time) a lot.  These kinds of motions cause me enough pain that it's rough to do quickly.  I try to compensate by turning my body more but it's still a fast motion.\n\nSo I'm getting ahead of myself.  First off, there's several kinds of shots to block.  The single ball (like a eighth note), the \"Comet\" type which is a ball with a streamer behind it (like a quarter note or more)  and then the stream of balls that curves across your view (which would be either like an arpeggio or a slurred note depending on your point of view).\n\nYou're graded on your accuracy (how many of the shots did you block?) as well as an artistic measurement which goes by how you moved to block the shots... did you move a lot? Were you standing mostly still?  Were you punching hard or just a little?I had enough on my plate trying to merely stand still and block so the most I did was try to punch each shot or slap it down as it came in my reach and after a while that starts to wear you out.\n\nFor music, this game can use your mp3s (though it prefers high quality music and some of your songs may be tagged as \"low bitrate\".) In a way though this game is like Audiosurf.  you move to hit/catch certain things that are flowing to the beat.  Most of the songs you'll find with a good leaderboard are the ones that are included from Soundcloud.  Remixes and mashups galore! \n\nI don't know if there's any check to see if a song is actually the song it purports to be, so it may be like audiosurf there as well (where you could have someone playing the 3 minute radio edit vs someone playing the 12 minute club remix on the same leaderboard).\n\nAnyway, if you need a workout and don't mind working up a sweat (which is easy to do) then this could be a big help to your exercise program.  For me personally I find it a bit TOO active.  There should be a way to group songs by how much motion is required... I hoped there'd be a more mellow mode but so far I haven't found one.\n\nThis would be another one I'd give a \"meh\" rating to, but since I didn't have any trouble playing it (other than my old man bones creaking) I'll still give it a thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1466392143, "timestamp_updated": 1466392278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620014727115631104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23660290": {"recommendationid": "23660290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976159552", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1520037933}, "language": "english", "review": "After seeing a ton of very polarized reviews, I decided to take a chance on this game.

I would describe it as a Guitar-hero-esque rhythm game in a catch the missle style.\n\n The game has many many reasons to be bought:\n\n-With a price of 19.99 Euros, it is one of the cheaper VR-titles\n-It runs fine, even on mediocre Pc\u00b4s\n-While playing, the risk of smashing something is rather small, as you do not have to move around a whole lot ( if you aren\u00b4t going batshit crazy when playing the game)\n-The ability to use your own music is a godsent, but even without a huge music collection, you are provided every day with a playlist of popular songs to play\n-The representation of your songs is very often on point, far better than I could ever have imagined! The game is not perfect, as only the most prominent notes are being picked up, even if it isn\u00b4t the melody or the bass-line, which is to be expected.\n-Leaderboards provide a welcome challenge, and the possibility to be notified by mail, when you have been beaten in a song is a funny addition too\n\nHowever, there are also a few ( nitpicky ) downsides which aren\u00b4t to be ignored:\n\n-For me, the sound output which I activated in the VR menu isn\u00b4t being respected, the sound then suddenly coming from my speakers when the game starts, even tho\u00b4 I put the output to the HDMI output. I solved the problem by mirroring the sound output to both my speakers and the HDMI.\n-The game is far too easy. Even when I pick the hardest difficulty, there have been no songs in which I had under 90% of correct notes\n- The music-selection menu gets a bit cluttered, the songs not being separated on pages but one ongoing cluster with all your songs\n\nFurthermore, I have to give the devs credit for fixing reoccuring problems very quickly.\nFor me, the game is a must buy for any VR- or Music-enthusiast.", "timestamp_created": 1466109414, "timestamp_updated": 1466109414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554140150547027588", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23590941": {"recommendationid": "23590941", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995861028", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1629343594}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably my favorite game on Vive so far (I'm maybe too easily entertained). The game is a lot of fun although there are a few things that frustrate me:\n * Impact detection - If you punch the orbs too hard or swing your hands at them, the crash detection misses them a lot of times. Makes it hard to encourage people to increase their artistic score if they are getting penalized for flailing their arms more.\n * Local songs - The game doesn't take advantage of your steam music collection, nor does it go out and pre-scan music collection folders for artists / song names / genre, etc. You are forced to navigate your folder hierarchy to find songs.\n * They don't show you how long your song is. You just have to play it through first. This led my wife to accidentally start 5-10 minutes into a 30 minute song! It also is frustrating when the song ends up being only 20-30 seconds.

The Soundcloud aspect makes it a great way to discover new music.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't have to be physically taxing, you can stand there and just move your arms to block the orbs but the game rewards physical activity and punch strength, which helps on leaderboards.\n\nI don't see myself growing tired of the gameplay anytime soon but if I did, the entertainment I have already received FAR exceeds the fairly modest price of $20.

Da verarbeitet der Algorithmus aber nicht alle Lieder gleich gut - letztlich ist aber auch da ein Lob auszusprechen, denn alles in allem passt es meist.\nAuf Dauer wird das Spiel etwas monoton, da es letztlich nun einmal immer das Gleiche ist, trotzdem kann man es stundenlang spielen und immer mal wieder f\u00fcr ein paar Songs starten.\n\nWer Musikspiele mag, darf Audioshield nicht verpassen, aber auch allen anderen kann ich es ausdr\u00fccklich empfehlen.\n\nTip: Das etwas unsch\u00f6ne Liedauswahl-Men\u00fc l\u00e4sst sich wesentlich bequem \u00fcber den Rechner bedienen!

But it's way too buggy to recommend right now.[/b][/h1]\n\nI want to like this game; I really do. In fact, when I can actually get to an arena and play a song, I enjoy it greatly. But...\n\n[h1]The bugs.[/h1]\nIt's really buggy. The thing I spend the most time doing is standing around in the featureless void waiting for a song to load, hoping it will work, and eventually taking off the headset to see the \"AudioShield not responding\" message on my monitor. And the waiting! Full disclosure; I have moved my VR computer into a room where I don't have wired network, and the wiki is weak. So it really shows up the programming and design flaws in the interface. Choosing any of my tracks off of my NAS via a network drive is interminable. It takes tens of seconds just to traverse each level of folder; when I settle on a band's folder it takes well over 60 seconds to load the thumbnails. During which time you're stuck in VR limbo -- a lobby would be nice, and maybe some progress indicators, so you can tell how long you're going to wait. When it finally does load some thumbnails, moving the headset produces an astonishing amount of jitter -- they should have used non-blocking code there. Then it usually crashes.\n\n[h1]The beatmapping.[/h1]\nAs others have noted, it doesn't really feel like you're \"playing along\" as you would in Rock Band. Their beat-mapping algorithm seems limited, and it would be really nice to see it improved. But to be honest I haven't gotten sick of that because I can't get to an arena very often (see crashing, above).\n\n[h1]Cannot recommend.[/h1]\nBasically, this is a great pre-release demo that should have been free and a teaser for the finished product, because they clearly haven't finished it yet. So I can't recommend it. But the few times you can get through to actually play a song, and the beats feel like they work? It's a lot of fun.

Another nice addition is leaderboards for your own music. if the metadata of the file that you're playing matches other files that were played with the same metadata, you get your own leaderboard for that song, which is a nice touch. The game itself is very enjoyable and probably has the most replay value of any other game I own. You feel very powerful smashing the notes with your shield. It really shows off the power of VR. You're even awarded points for hitting the notes harder, so you're made to work for the highscore. This game is simple, yet a lot of fun.

I would buy a Vive for this game alone.\n\nThis game absolutely nails the old principle of easy to learn, hard to master. The concept is simple: block the dots with your shields. I found it to be kind of fun and pretty easy on Normal difficulty. Once you increase it to Harder the game really shines. The dots match closer to the music and you have to move quickly. It's great exercise. Not the kind that will make you breathe heavy if you're in shape, the kind where your muscles are sore the day after playing for a few hours. Every genre of music is different so try out different things.\n\nIt's not perfect. As I said, it's pretty easy on Normal and not as immersive because the dots don't match the beat well. Some genres of music are less fun. If all you like is slow, boring music this isn't for you. If music doesn't make you want to move this probably won't be very fun. If you're significantly out of shape and overweight you may find it challenging but it could be a great way to get some exercise.\n\nThe game crashes. A LOT. Sometimes I get lucky when I launch it and it works. Most of the time it crashes a few times before it's stable. It crashes in multiple places, on launch, on song restart, and on song end. Disabling my second monitor seems to make the Vive more stable although I'm not sure if it helps Audioshield's stability.

The devs seem to be AWOL and ignoring all threads on the discussion page. My advice is to skip this for now. Wait for the sequel or at least for a few more updates in case they actually implement mod support and/or some much-needed bug fixes. I'll update this if it changes. \n\nOkay, here are my main gripes: \n\nGripe 1) The music browser is really, really bad. It's nearly unusuable. If you have a lot of music, you will sit for 30 seconds or more at a time waiting for it to refresh whenever you change folders. Finding a song you want will be a long and tedious process. The search function is slow and doesn't work very well. \n\nGripe 2) The mechanic where orbs will speed up and slow down without any warning or indication (presumably to match a beat, though it usually doesn't). That's not really how rhythm games should work. The idea is you're supposed to see the orbs coming and know when they're going to hit based on how far they are. If they stop just out of range and then dash in sporadically and inconsistently, it kind of breaks the rhythm. In some songs it just completely ruins the fun as the orbs are jittering and stuttering and they arrive off the beat instead of when they should. \n\nGripe 3) The algorithm for building tracks isn't very good. It would be a LOT more fun if there were some noticeable rhyme or reason to when orbs appear, where they appear from, and which color they are. As it stands it seems to be just random and scattered all over. There are no patterns, there's no emergent beauty; it's just a bunch of dots coming from all over at varying speeds (not keeping tempo) and then not really arriving on the beat at all. You can see how the game is ALMOST something really special, like with a bit more testing and maybe one more game designer with a sense for music somewhere in the mix, it would have become something really great. \n\nThat really sums up my overall impression of this game. With a few improvements it would be amazing. But as it stands right now, it's a disappointment. \n\nIn addition, the game does crash quite a lot, and it doesn't crash gracefully. I've had to restart my machine more than once.", "timestamp_created": 1462551400, "timestamp_updated": 1463218285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22828400": {"recommendationid": "22828400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052863104", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11620, "last_played": 1619020158}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally a delightful game, in that there were moments I was filled with delight while playing.

The bubbles are inconsistent, resulting in some songs providing far less compelling experienes than others.. I will say that you will get the most out of this game if you enjoy electronic music. Although rock, progressive, pop, and other genres work within Audioshield, they tend not to provide as exciting and dynamic of rhythm for the gameplay.\n\nAdditionally, the gameplay is limited to two stages and three types of shield.

Most of the time these charts end up being garbage, and you'd be better off just playing a game like Space Pirate Trainer with music in the background, but every now and then a song works really well and that's when this game shines. The problem is that the game is very buggy, and in the hour I played I ended up halfway through the floor twice, SteamVR crashed 3 times, my SteamVR desktop view was broken until I restarted SteamVR twice, and the game crashed every time I tried to close it, which I had to at one point when I chose the wrong song and the End Song button didn't respond to anything. Audioshield has potential, but right now it's so buggy that I'm considering refunding it and waiting to see if it gets patched.

watch here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsStC-yKJWc\n\n[b]Room Size Requirements[/b]\nIf you have 180 degrees of space to swing your arms forwards then you're set. No physical movement around the room is required to play\n\n[b]Performance (on minimum specs)[/b]\nRunning on \"Ultra\" settings and 2x anti-aliasing with a GTX970. Performance is perfect, no frame drops.\n\n[b]Level of immersion[/b]\nThis is very dependant on the choice of song. Audioshield allows you to play any music you own, or from online sources such as soundcloud. If you enjoy the music you're playing then you'll easily lose yourself in this world. So if you're not feeling it, try some different songs or genres until you get the ones that fit you. I find high energy songs, or songs with a strong beat work best.\n\n[b]Method of movement[/b]\nMostly standing (or dancing). It's all 1-1 tracked movement, no teleporting or being thrown around.\n\n[b]Comfort[/b]\nOverall very comfortable experience. A washable cover for your HMD would be ideal, as you'll find yourself sweating after high energy songs. Sometimes the notes fly down from very high above you, meaning you have to look up at a steep angle. An option to lower the maximum height of the notes would be ideal to prevent any neck strain. \n\n[b]Interaction[/b]\nThe haptic feedback is what makes this game. Everytime you hit the notes, you get feedback which makes it feel like you've hit something that's physically there. It does wonders for the immersion. The shields are perminately attached to your controllers, so it's super easy, no fiddling around to pick things up.\n\n[b]Social[/b]\nIf you're wearing headphones, it's not fun for everybody else in the room who can't hear the music.

I bought it because I kept seeing this game recommended on reddit. \n\nThis is now my most played VR game. When the balls line up well with the music, it feels magical. You just feel powerful. \n\nThe game works best with faster paced, high energy \"simple\" songs. The more layers there are to the music, more likely the balls will not match the song. When the game does not match the song, you feel like you're just punching random balls while the song is playing in the background. This is the game's greatest weakness. I think the developer needs to change the ball making algorithm to use just the lows and highs of a song and kind of leave the mids out of it. \n\nThe game is very buggy for me. It often crashes after 1 or 2 songs.  \n\nI love being able to stream songs from soundcloud since I don't have much of a music collection. The leaderboards keep me coming back. I'm not sure if the leaderboards are actually separated based off difficulty selected or not. \n\nThe game kind of bugs out anytime it loads anything, but you just have to stand still until it's finished loading.

It has some issues and not for everyone but overall it is an exciting experience.\n\nPros:\n1) Gameplay: The gameplay is extremely simple and the variety of shields gives it enough variety to play with. The different shields essentially determine how you will block the notes and has an impact on your physical motions.\n\n2) Visuals: Honestly the game looks extremely basic and unitneresting just based on videos and pictures. I had many people look at the game running on the monitor thinking it was pretty bland but put on the headset and feel overwhelmed and excited. I myself am guilty of this as well. The impact of the notes on your shieds are bot tactile and visually stimulating. There are often times where the explosions can actually distracting and prevent you from seeing the notes directly after.\n\nCons:\n1) The Music: This isn't a huge issue personally but it is enough so that I must mention it. The game lets you play music off of a limited selection off of SoundCloud so there isn't much to pick from to begin with. Fortunately (or unfortunately for some) it allows you to pick songs files on your harddrive. For someone like me who has a lot of music files, I am able to delve into that library and play songs to no end. However, if you do not have such a collection, you might find yourself playing the same few songs over and over again. \n\n2) The Algorithm: The game generates notes by analyzing the file and then spitting it back at you. Unfortunately, it isn't as refined as I would like it to be. There are some songs that work extremely well that will make you feel like you are fighting the music itself. However there are other songs that don't feel well represented by the algorithm. The algorithm works extremely well with clear distinctive snares and beats like electronic music and pop songs. Anything else like rock however seems to not play well. Overall I feel like I'm hitting random notes about 50% of the time.\n\nConclusion/TLDR:\nI would recommend this game for the experience itself as it is truly a fun VR experience. If you have a substantial library of music of your own to play with however, this is an extremely worthwhile game. It has addictive gameplay and the different shields will make the same songs feel like a different experience.

It's simplistic in a good way; Audiosurf tended to overcomplicate the game with all sorts of gamemodes when almost everyone played the game in mono mode. The core gameplay is simplistic in the way mono mode in Audiosurf is. But it is also challenging, moreso than Audiosurf. It has that same arcade high score focus but the basic gameplay is overall more fun because it encourages you to move to the music. It's designed from the ground up for VR and it shows. \n\nIt's a comfortable game for VR and I can't imagine anyone getting sick from this. It can also be played in a very small space as you stay in a single position. \n\nIt's not a perfect game and I feel like it needs some polish, specifically in the menus which feel unfinished and clunky to navigate. The curation of tracks could also use work. Personally I don't have any audio tracks on local storage as I stream everything from Spotify and have done so for some time, and I suspect many people are the same. There is Youtube integration but for it to really elevate the game there should be some better curation on offer. It could be as simple as pulling data from the trending and most popular tracks on Youtube. That would keep it fresh, offer 'new' content weekly with little further input from the developer once implemented and prevent the 'most popular' Audioshield list from ending up stagnant as it currently stands. Also the beat detection isn't perfect, and you'll quickly find that like in Audiosurf, some songs are just better to play than others, with the best generally being those with a prominent beat. \n\nI recommend this game as it is fun and is unique in its ability to make levels out of any music.

This is what you get when you apply that to virtual reality. The core gameplay comes down to picking out songs on your local machine or available on Soundcloud and surviving the resulting barrage of blue and orange balls which represent your music in the virtual space.  Audioshield is focused on this mechanic alone with laser precision, and completely nails the execution. To this point, I have not had any desynchronization between my controllers and the shields in the game - every note I miss is my fault.\n\nI didn't get sucked in to Audiosurf, though I did enjoy it. However the sense of presence that it's successor gains from being in virtual reality does a great job selling the experience. It's easy to get in to the rhythm and the music and bring some artistic flair to your one-man shield wall. In fact, more active performances from the players are gauged higher than passive renditions. To keep up on the leaderboards as they shake out in this game, I suspect that maintaining an active playstyle will be crucial towards maintaining top spots on popular songs.\n\nWhat comes hand-in-hand with this Audioshield experience is a break from the sedentary lifestyle from those of us that need it. If you need to trick yourself in to staying a little more active in your day-to-day, it's not hard to work up a sweat in this game and the feedback from the experience will keep you to the routine if you let it.\n\nTo answer a question that has come up a lot on reddit and other places, there is no Spotify integration for this game due to the encrypted nature of offline songs from that service. Similarly, Microsoft Groove songs will show up in your list of playable songs with all the proper metadata however no music makes it to the level when you select it.\n\nI can recommend this game without reservation as an excellent choice for brand new VR libraries if you've got a thing for rhythm games and aren't afraid of sweating.

Man oh man was I wrong. This game puts you in a really cool stage environment your left hand wields a blue shield and your right hand wields a red shield (looks more orange to me). If you put your shields together or pull one of the triggers on the controller, you create a purple shield. Your goal is to block the blue, red, and purple orbs that are coming at you, to the beat of the music, with the according color shield. The game is simple but extremely fun and while not perfect the orbs match the beat of the song extremely well. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Can import any mp3 on your computer.\n[*]Visuals, especially the particle effects flying around your shield, are really fun and good looking.\n[*]Simple, anyone can pick this up making it a great party game. It was easy swap headsets between songs to let everyone try it. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Not a lot of included songs with the game it really doesn\u2019t shine unless you import your own. The included songs have a lot of variety and are really good though.\n[*]UI is a little weird, I think the difficulty is supposed to be normal, hard, harder but often times I would see the same option twice i.e. Normal, harder, harder. \n[*]Easy, with only three notes (purples are hardly used) it is hard to miss a lot of notes. As far as I know of you can\u2019t fail out of a song like you can in Guitar Hero for missing too many notes. When I would give the headset to someone new they had no trouble playing it on harder without any previous experience with it. \n[/list]\n\n[b]TLDR:[/b]\nFantastic game, buy it. I really didn\u2019t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was the favorite at my launch day party and we ended up sinking the most time in to this game.
