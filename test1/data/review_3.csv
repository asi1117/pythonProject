109318953,english,"This game is great fun!

For me the fact that I can use my own mp3 is right at the top of the list of reasons for choosing this, over similar games.
The song tracking can be a bit off (it will depend on the tune) but I'll 1000x rather have variable results depending on the audio I feed it, than having to pay to listen to pop drivel.

Complaining at the dev because YouTube changed their policy... well the frustration is understandable, but it's pointless taking it out on the dev. 
They are just trying to make a good game, in a genre that has a lot of inherent pitfalls related to IP/copyright.

If you create content for YouTube, you'll find out that Google are great at 2 things:
1) Finding a target audience for your content.
2) Screwing everyone over while weaseling the profits away into a tax haven.

Not necessarily in that order.
Streaming services are largely the same shit.

Just get a few mp3, completely free, and keep playing the game.

For the dev: 
If you want some music to use for your game - hit me up.
I make music in all kinds of genres, some of which is currently on radio, and it'd be fun to make custom tracks specific for this. 
I'd love to get into sound design and music for games anyway, it'd be a win-win deal.

I promise you there's a lot of indie producers out there who make great quality music, who would also be more than happy to collaborate. I'd probably know a few :)",76561197976137914,480,44,134,0,102,1644780905,1643807067,1644772230,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I have over 980 artists in my personal collection. The main thing i like about this game is it lets you use YOUR music.

You wanna play Pop smoke right after? you can. You wanna switch to Frank Sinatra? You can. And all done pretty seemlessly, assuming you have your music organized.

103169084,english,"Love it! I've just really started stepping out into the world of VR rhythm games. I've been playing a lot of Beat Saber the last week and really enjoy the game, but was kinda disappointed at the lack of songs that come with the game and DLC is pricey.

I'd had my eyes on Audio Shield for a long time, it was actually the first rhythm VR game I ever wishlisted. I loved the idea of adding my own music. Well I finally got the game and fired it up today. It took a second to figure out how to add my music to the game. Once I did though I couldn't stop for almost an hour!

I finally got to play The Stupendium's song Impossible Geometry... a song about Beat Saber... in a rhythm game! I actually played a bunch of Stupendium's music and it was an absolute blast. Highly recommend that music in this game.

So obviously I like the game... but here's some notes...

1) About Adding Your Music: You do have to have the mp4 files on your pc in order to add the music to your game. Be it with files you've had on your pc for a while... or even soundtracks from steam (I'm gonna play the hell out of Skul's Soundtrack ngl). It's really easy to do. From within the game you can go to whatever drive your music is on, go to the folder, and then select the song. Once you select the song you get to select difficulty, background, type of shield, and then you are off to the races! The game will auto generate a map for your song to whatever difficulty you selected and the maps are pretty damn good. The only way the music situation can make this game suck for you is if you are the kind of person who has only ever listened to music on Spotify.

2) About the Maps: Like I said the maps are really good for being Auto Generated. There is the occasional moment where two different color notes are immediately one after the other, in the same spot, and it's damn impossible to hit. Otherwise they are really good maps. A word of caution though, your first play through of a song may be a bit laggy. The game generates the maps pretty quickly, but once you load in for the first time that song can be a bit wonky. Once you've played it that first time though it plays seamlessly. You can also save a song to favorites if you enjoyed it so you don't have to hunt the song down again. I will say that the beats seem to be kinda off on Normal maps, but once you pump up to hard the maps are pretty good at matching the beat. Honestly the normal ones only seem off cause they have fewer notes.

3) The Youtube Situation: This is a non issue for me but I figured I would address it. I understand that people who purchased the game when it had the Youtube support were upset when the game had this feature removed. I understand it and it is justifiable if you bought the game for that reason. However, to  me, this does not reduce the quality of the game in the slightest. Like I said.. if you have an actual copy of a song on your computer... you can play it! There's no limit on how much music you can play. There's no modding involved to play a song you like. You can play whatever song you want... and they won't even be sensored *le gasp*. Seriously, there not being youtube only ruins the game if you don't have any mp3s on your pc or on a jumpdrive somewhere. As someone who never got rid of her files from her MP3 player from ""ye days of old"" I've got a ton of music to play. As someone who still owns CD's from ""ye days of old"" I can rip whatever music I want onto my pc and play it freely. As someone who owns soundtracks for various games on her account. Let's fucking go! So seriously. If you fall into the category of ""Person who has the abilty to get or who has mp3 files"" you can play and enjoy this game.

4) Graphics: Omg I love them. You have a selection of a few backgrounds to play on and there's nothing ""spectacular"" about any of them, but they are nice. Where the graphics are really cool in this game is that when you first start the game... way off in the distance.... you can see tons of little dots of red and blue. Those are your notes... coming at your face. It's honestly really cool to be able to see just how many notes are going to be coming your way as you play. They don't show up a few seconds before you hit them. Nah nah nah. You get the full scope of what you will be doing almost right out of the gate. A few songs I played I saw those dots in the distance and was like ""Oh fuck I'm about to get wrecked...""

5) Controls: The controls are simple. You have shields on your hands and you smack the orbs. Put hands together to smack purple notes. If you wanna get some extra movement in and get some aggression out then feel free to punch them. Simple mechanic. The only thing is that it seems like if your shields aren't somewhat within your FOV that you will miss notes which is kinda annoying. You also can't move much. There is an area highlight that you have to stay in and if you move out of that little square you will miss tons of notes. Not really a control here, but a mechanic. You don't seem to be able to ""fail"" a song. Which is something I really like as it means I can just play and enjoy the song. I won't have my song suddenly ended because I missed a few notes. At the end you see how well you did and it's just kinda all about beating yourself and your high score. So it's not about failing, it's about how good you did.

6) Difficulty: It really depends on the song. I found some of the songs I played were super easy on normal... and not awful on hard... but some songs just kicked my ass in hard difficulty. Which I loved :) tbh

7) Exercise: Omg this is a work out! There is ALOT more full body movement in this than Beat Saber as the notes fly in from a pretty wide FOV. Notes can also come from slightly above you so you have to look up to hit them and then look back down to hit more. It's not rapid head movement, but head movement. The wide FOV makes it so you have to look around and move your body around more. If you decide to actually punch notes rather than just gently tapping them it adds even more to the work out. 

Conclusion: This is a damn good game and highly underrated. Again the amount of music you can play is limitless. Even more so than modding because with modding YOU have to make your map or hope someone else has. With this game you can play whatever you can get your hands on easily. It's far more of a work out than any other rhythm VR game I've played so far. It can be a bit laggy at points but by far this does not make the game unplayable by any means. The only real downside I could think of is that it takes like 30 seconds to load a song in for the first time... so when you first start playing you need a bit of patience. Once you have a library of maps built up though you'll be golden.",76561198169419827,988,80,47,0,42,1637475755,1637448754,1637448754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ich wurde allerdings sehr schnell enttäuscht. Die Idee ist klasse und auch, dass es mit jedem Lied funktionieren soll.

In meinem Fall hätte ich mir also erst mal einiges von Youtube oder so downloaden müssen. Bei dem Spiel an sich sind nämlich nur sehr wenige Lieder dabei. Bei 50% davon kam bei mir auch keine Stimmung auf.

85851148,japanese,"VR専用のリズムアクション。曲に合わせて飛んでくる玉を左右の手で受け止めていく。

VRのリズムゲーはいろいろあるが、このゲームで特徴的なのは、手持ちの楽曲を使用できるというところ。AudioSurfの技術を使い、音楽ファイルから玉の出現が自動生成される。他のゲームは曲が限定されていて、遊びあきたり、曲の好みが合わなかったりということがあるが、このゲームでは好きな曲で遊べるのでそんな心配がいらない。

ゲームモードは難易度３種、通常モードとフィットネスモードがある。フィットネスモードでは玉だけでなく、しゃがんでよける障害物が出てきてこれがけっこうきつい。

ゲームとしては玉の出方に多少パターンはあるものの、基本２種類が飛んでくるだけなのでわりと単調。じっとして玉を受けているだけではちょっとつまらないと感じるかも。しかしこのゲームにはArtisticalという特典があり、たくさん動いたり速く手を動かしたりすると高得点になる。つまりただ受けているだけでは点は上がらず、リズムのノリノリでパンチを繰り出せばスコアが上がっていくという仕組み。なので好きな曲にノリノリで腕をブンブン振れば振るほど良いスコアになるし、これがけっこう楽しいし、良い運動になる。

自分はダイエットの一環として使っているが、ノーマルモードでも30分300kcalくらいになるので効率は良い感じ。ただしほぼ腕しか動かさないので、リズムに乗ってはねたりと意図的に全身を動かす工夫があるともっと良いかと。

スコアボードにも対応していて、同じ曲でプレイした世界中のプレイヤーの成績と競い合うこともできる。

もうちょっと玉の出現のパターンや、おまけの何かがあればもっと楽しかったかもしれないが、いまでもノリノリにさえなれれば十分に楽しめる。

Etwas angesoffen und in heiterer Runde war es recht egal, dass die Beat-Abstimmung eher selten wirklich gut passte.
Heute kann ich Audioshield nicht mehr empfehlen. Die YouTube-Einbindung ist futsch, die Menüführung fummelig und der Entwickler lässt seit Jahren den Elfmeter für eine Mod-Integration einfach liegen.

82853853,english,"I have a lot of VR games that I never play, but I keep coming back to this one. Some people will put it down and say that games like Beat Saber have better beat mapping. But that’s because it’s not procedural, like Audioshield and most of the fun is in listening to the music that I love. Also, how fun it is, largely depends on the song. If you’re bored in this, then you’re definitely playing the wrong song. Much of the music I listen to seems like it was made for this game and is extremely challenging. I like the faster pace too.

As for the negatives, the biggest one is the low volume. I think I read somewhere that the devs were looking out for your hearing, or some garbage. But I can barely hear the music using my Vive. And it’s the only app that I have this problem with. I have to go through a bunch of extra steps to hook it up to my stereo and disable the Vive audio, just to get a halfway decent volume.

The second negative is that a lot of songs have all of the orbs coming from above you so that you have to crank your neck back, to see what’s going on. It’s not a challenge, it’s just physically uncomfortable, for no good reason. I really wish they’d fix that.

Despite the negatives, this game is my main reason for owning VR, at this point. Once you get into that zone, nothing feels better than deflecting thousand of orbs without missing a single one. You feel like Neo, at the end of the Matrix. It’s almost hard for me to listen to music without playing it. I instinctively put up my guard, when I hear a good song now. If you’re just looking for a good workout, Beat Saber would probably be more up your alley. If music is important to you, then Audioshield is the way to go.

If you want to play songs that you actually know and listen to outside of rhythm gaming, this is pretty darned excellent. The automapping is the best that I've encountered, which is to say that solid human generated maps are much better, but I also prefer something automapped to a bad human map. It's more like picking out some tunes and staring at them directly, rather than having them filtered through someone else's sense of what constitutes difficulty. That can be a nice change of pace. The hit detection can be a little squirrely. I actually really like the play environments.

The number one advantage of this game is the automatically generated maps. They're satisfying enough to play - not as good as the curated maps of a rhythm game's official and the best community maps - but they'll have rhythm, they're the songs you own so you probably like them, and they're not bad - frequently good, even - they'll just never be excellent.

Now that i've got that out of the way...

I'll be honest. I bought this game over Beat Saber because it actually supports the tracks I want to play. Because i am [i]not like those other guyz[/i], my music tastes are just outside the mainstream that the tracks that i would want to play would never get a beatmap. Sure i could download a beatmap for Nine Inch Nail's Closer or whatever, but who's going to make a beatmap for their version of Memorabilia by Soft Cell?

[i]Linking to it because it's so good.[/i]

Also, the map generation is not that bad. Is it perfect? Of course not, but it gets the job done, and that's all i need. Sure, good premade beatmaps will usually be better than anything the game can spit out, but Audioshield still knows how to time the blocks to an element of the music in a way that makes sense most of the time. And something is a hundred times better than nothing.

If you love Beat Saber, consider this the other weapon in your VR music game arsenal. And lets be honest, bashing blocks with your hands is still fun, no matter how rough around the edges.

IMPORTANT EDIT: The fitness mode is really good. I can still feel my legs.

Oh, and there's a mod to bring back YouTube support.

The game that paved the road for beat saber to take the crown. This was the first video game in which a gamer with a love of music could combine their two passions in the virtual reality world. The player goes into a musical track of their choice with a pair of shields and have to do their best to get the highest score possible by blocking the beats. 

However, I can't give this game a higher rating than that of 6. While it's simplistic gameplay is both repetitive and enjoyable. It's repetitive factor is also what brings it down. Upon release it was possible to find music on youtube and an algorithm would create a level allowing you to play to your favourite tracks. Since this feature was removed most likely due to copyright reasons, the lack of playable tracks makes the game somewhat boring when comparing to the likes of beat saber.

69281430,english,"I picked this up early in the Vive/Steam VR life - at the time, it was a fun way to play to sounds I enjoyed from YouTube.  Unfortunately, that time has passed.  (TL;DR:  YouTube support is gone, and the procedural generation just doesn't produce an enjoyable experience.)

At the time, Audioshield had two things going for it.  Procedural track generation, so any song ""just worked,"" and the ability to search YouTube for songs and plan anything you found.  Since then, however, the YouTube functionality has been removed, requiring you to have all songs downloaded to your computer - which might not be an option for some songs that are only available on YouTube.  I can't find any kind of patch notes or posting on why this feature was removed - it's just gone.  The fact that seemingly core features were removed alone would be reason for me to recommend NOT picking up this game.

However, the procedural generation just hasn't stood the test of time.  Beat Saber originally got flak for not using procedural generation for tracks, but Beat Saber's tracks have much better flow than anything I'm now getting out of Audioshield.  Seriously, even the provided songs give you wild, poorly paced beats that I feel like I'm either chasing or being psyched out on.  While a custom track made by a person could be bad, at least you have the option of playing something better.  In the case of Audioshield, you ONLY have the bad; you can't have it try again and give you something better.  When the core feature of the game makes it unenjoyable compared to other similar titles, I have to recommend against picking it up.

69019148,english,"Great concept, brilliant being able to use music in your collection instead of having to rely on pre-made maps or custom downloads, and the orbs do fly towards you in time to the music, and behave in different ways depending on the beat, rhythm etc. At first I was impressed but a couple of things annoyed me to the point of requesting a refund. 
First of all something I'd read in another review, saying that there needs to be an option to change the opacity/transparency of the shields, or perhaps even the size too, as they get in the way of things a bit and sometimes obscure incoming orbs.
Secondly, perhaps it's just on the Vive, but the 'field of play' is too wide for a comfortable game - the Vive has a certain amount of 'binocular' vision so you can only see a portion of the play area at any one time - and you can't help but miss some simply because you can't see them in time. This was the deal breaker for me, it just became too annoying - especially on harder settings when they're coming at you fast! Again, perhaps a setting to adjust the field of play depending on your device would be handy. Plenty of other VR games enable you to adjust things like controllers etc, so something like a simple grid to determine your field of vision would be good. I think it's good that there are some out of your immediate vision to get you moving more, but at the moment it is too wide and makes it unplayable.
Shame, I was looking forward to it, especially using your own tunes - I play BeatSaber, BoxVR, Sound Boxing and Synth Riders, so I had an idea of what to expect, but I was expecting something better for the amount of money I was charged!

67149832,english,"Fantastic game, a worthy successor to Audiosurf for the new VR world. As with Audiosurf, the more intense the song, the more intense the play session, made more true when played at a higher difficulty. However, where in Audiosurf it was intense because it looked like driving a fast car through traffic, it's far more so in Audioshield because everything is flying at you from in front and above you. It's quite the experience playing Edge of the Earth by 30 Seconds to Mars on elite, staring up as an endless onslaught of red and blue spheres about to come and ruin your day. And you could do far worse for a workout game.

It should not be compared to Beat Saber, in my view. They serve two different purposes. Beat Saber is a structured experience, like Dance Dance Revolution, where each track is hand crafted for the song. Audioshield is a procedurally generated experience. It provides access to an algorithm that turns your songs into something to play without needing additional input on your end. Mr. Fitterer has already done all the crafting on his part to make an engine that creates an enjoyable and harrowing experience for you with each song you play.

I would recommend Audiosurf 1/2 before trying this to compare. Those games had pure style, lights that increased in temperature based on the intensity of the music you were playing. The only thing you get in this game are slightly quicker moving blue or red orbs in a handful of dark/dull environments. Also, and this could just be me playing obscure hits, but every song I played seemed to show a broken leaderboard.

All in all, the developer seems to shrink away from the game, popping up occasionally to fix a minor bug or add controller compatibility without ever adding any quality-of-life features. It could have been a strong contender to Beat Saber, now owned by the ominous Facebook, but Audioshield seems content with itself collecting dust in the VR closet.",76561197973285103,215,15,48,0,41,1578975600,1578969661,1578969661,False,6,0,0.580553114414215088,0,True,False,False

60913874,japanese,"VRの音ゲーとしてはシンプルで一番好きかも知れない。 
ゲーム要素よりも体を動かすフィットネス感覚を評価。 
 
飛んでくる青と赤の弾幕を、左右の手にした同色の盾で防ぎ続けるだけ。 
楽曲は同メーカーの「Audiosurf」と言うゲームの曲が入ってる模様。 
また、PC内にある楽曲を使って譜面を自動生成して遊ぶ事も可能。 
つまり楽曲数は無限大！　ここが一番良かった。 
 
まず不満を挙げると、ゲーム中にスコアの表示が無い。リザルト画面でも飛んできた弾の総数も書かれて無い。 
プレイ中の背景が５つ（内１つは真っ暗）しかない。しかも背景によっては盾の透過処理が非常に見辛く、次に来る弾が見えない。 
もうちょっとビジュアル面での変化が付けれると良かった。 
飛んで来るのを矢とか星みたいに見た目を変更出来たら面白そうなんだけど。 
あと、体力の導入を希望。ミスし過ぎると強制終了とかにすると盾で守ってる感が出てもっとゲームとして楽しめたと思う。 
 
とにかくシンプルで、ボタンやトリガーはほぼ使わず腕を前にかざすだけ。時折来る紫の弾は両手を重ねる様にすると出て来る紫の盾で防ぐ。（紫の盾は設定にて両トリガー同時押しに変更可） 
見上げると空の彼方から飛んで来るとんでもない量の弾幕を、次々と盾で受けていくだけなのに、曲がサビに近づくと共にテンションも上がってくる。 
フィットネスモードにすれば弾幕に交じって△型の枠が頭の高さで飛来し、これを避けねばならない。 と言っても頭に当たる程度の高さなので軽いスクワットの感覚で避けられ、横に傾いで避けたり、背を反らしてマトリックス避けしてみたり。足腰の運動にもなる。 
加えて、グローブ型の盾（当たり判定が拳の位置）を使ってシャドウボクシングの様にプレイすれば 上半身の動きも追加でき、お手軽フィットネスの完成。 
１曲で４～５分程度✕３曲もプレイすれば汗だくになれます。

たった一人の最終防衛線となって、降り注ぐ敵弾の雨からナニカを守護ってみせるぜ！

それでは一つずつ書いていこうじゃないか。

・自分の持っている好きな曲で遊べる
・盾でノーツを受け止めるゲームが斬新

この２点がまず浮かんだ。
他にも考えれば出るような気がするが大まかにはこの２点。

次に悪い点を挙げる。
・マップ(曲の譜面）がランダム生成
・リズムにワンテンポずれて飛んでくる

この２点だ。

え？２点しかないのかって？ないね！

結論でビートセイバーのほうが面白いと書いたが、ぶっちゃけつまらないとは思わない。
リズムのずれは前後に自分が合わせればいい！（中心地に向かってくるので前に出れば出るほど運動量UPするけど）

しかも何より、好きな曲を遊べるからな。
ただ、この点で細かいことを言うと、「自分の知らない楽曲」をプレイできない。
オトゲーマーならわかると思うが、意外と知らない楽曲をやりたくなったりする。

54412564,english,"Audio Shield benefits from the novelty of being able to play any song, or audio file, for that matter on your computer. You essentially tap colored spheres with similarly colored shields to the beat. To be fair, the game does a good job of automatically generating beats for songs it's never heard. 

The problem is, that it's really not as fun or exciting as other games like Beat Saber. In Beat Saber, you hack and slash your way through the beat, but in this, you just sort of tap the dots. In Beat Saber, telling whether or not you have succeeded or failed in slashing a block is easy, as there are sound cues to let you know. In this game, you really can't tell. The most you get is a faint controller vibration, and that's it.

Also, the game has a tendency to spawn the dots which you are supposed to interact with outside of your field of view. This means you can very well lose a lot of points without knowing it. Also, in order to see the dots, you have to crane your neck upwards. So, if you like your neck getting sore after a nice, long VR session, this is the game for you! In Beatsaber, these aren't problems, because all you have to do is just look straight ahead and the blocks will spawn in front of you. 

I compare this game to Beatsaber because, frankly, Beatsaber is the better deal. Sure, out of the box, Audioshield offers more songs, but Beatsaber offers mods that expand the song range, hell, I even have a mod for Beatsaber that automatically generates where the blocks appear depending on the beat... which is the same thing this game does.

53630482,german,"Technische Probleme waren bei mir das größte Problem. Ich habe eine Oculus Rift S und dort funktioniert das Tracking über die Kameras in der Brille. Da man bei dem Spiel dauerhaft nach oben schauen muss, zeigen auch die Kameras nach oben und ""sehen"" die Controller nicht mehr. Das bedeutet, dass man viele Orbs einfach nicht erwischt, weil die Controller nicht getrackt werden. Wenn man dann mit dem Controller wieder in das Sichtfeld einer Kamera kommt, ploppt aus dem Nichts plötzlich das entsprechende Schild auf. Zudem habe ich es immer wieder, dass die Kugeln einfach durch das korrekte Schild fliegen, als wäre es garnicht da. Ein Update auf die hoch gelobte Oculus Beta 1.39 hat das ganze zwar etwas verbessert, aber trotzdem habe ich noch viele Aussetzer beim Tracking der Controller – während z.B. „In Death“ durch diesen Patch plötzlich perfekt läuft.

Wenn man von zuvor viele Stunden Beat Saber gespielt hat, wird einen Audioshield in den Wahnsinn treiben. Dort sind die Farben genau anders herum. Rot ist rechts und Blau ist links. Das Gehirn sagt aber: ""Mir doch egal ob in Wahrheit rechts Rot ist. Da ist Blau! PUNKT!"". Es gibt aber keinen Menüpunkt, um die Farben auszutauschen. Das muss mühsam durch Bearbeitung einer LUA Datei im Spieleverzeichnis gemacht werden, wo die Änderungen eventuell durch Updates wieder rückgängig gemacht werden. Bei Beat Saber gibt es übrigens eine entsprechende Funktion zum Tausch der Farben in den Einstellungen.

Ein Pluspunkt von Audioshield ist, dass die Level automatisch zur gewählten Musik (Lokale MP3 Dateien) generiert werden. Diese fühlen sich aber größtenteils nicht sonderlich flüssig an. Während man bei den von Hand gemappten Levels von Beat Saber in eine Art instinktive Trance fällt, wirken die Level bei Audioshield sehr willkürlich. Dazu kommt noch dass die Orbs gerne mal außerhalb des Sichtfelds kommen. So schaut man sich einfach nur ständig hektisch um (mit den Kopfbewegungen einer Taube) und versucht unlogisch angeordnete Kugeln zu blocken. Der Rythmus der Kugeln passt auch oft genug nicht richtig zum Rythmus der Musik - deshalb gibt es auch Listen mit Liedern die gut funktionieren im Internet. Das ganze Spiel fühlt sich einfach nicht gut an und macht auch wenig Spaß im Gegensatz zum Lichtschwert-konkurrenten. Man kommt einfach  nicht in diesen süchtig machenden Flow.

The music picking screen is not good either, it really needs to retain your position in the parent folder when you open a new folder and then return.

TEMPS DE JEU ESTIME :
Il est difficile d’estimer le temps que tu passeras sur ce jeu. Si tu joues uniquement avec les musiques de base, tu risques de te lasser rapidement. Mais la force de ce jeu, si tu y ajoutes tes MP3 : sa durée devient illimitée. 😊

DESCRIPTION :
[Audioshield] est un jeu de rythme sorti le 5 avril 2016 par [Dylan Fitterer]. Choisi la musique, l’environnement, le niveau de difficulté et surtout la forme de tes boucliers.  Une fois lancé, tu auras un bouclier orange dans la main droite et un bleu dans la gauche, la musique démarre et c’est là que tout commence. Sur le rythme de la musique, des boules de couleurs viennent à toi. Ton but sera de les attraper avec la bonne couleur de bouclier. 

IMPRESSIONS :
[Audioshield] est selon moi une suite spirituelle en VR de [Audiosurf]. Au lieu de déplacer un vaisseau au clavier/souris pour attraper des blocs, il faut utiliser les boucliers que tu as en main pour attraper des boules de couleur. C’est beaucoup plus immersif.
La synchronisation des musiques importées avec l’arrivée des boules est bonne. Si tu t’en sens l’envie et le courage, je te suggère de passer rapidement du mode facile à normal voir plus difficile. Car même si le jeu se corse, vu qu’il y a plus de boules, le rythme des projectiles s’adapte mieux à la musique. Je te conseille, pour plus de fun, d’importer tes MP3. 

LE MOT DE LA FIN :
Moi qui IRL n’aime pas danser car je suis raid comme un tronc… dans [Audioshield] je me sens à l’aise et je me prends facilement au jeu. Comme je disais plus haut, si tu importes les musiques qui te font bouger, ce jeu prend une toute autre dimension et le plaisir est réellement présent.

48197161,english,"I really wanted to like this game. I've given it the full go round now. But its got some significant problems which I may change my review in the future if they patch it up eventually.

One, I don't mind the lack of youtube support, I prefer to listen to my own library.

However, there is a huge problem in that the user interface for digging around your file system is terribly crude and primitive. The truly pitiful thing is that this app is made in Unity, and for under $50 bucks they could easy buy an off the shelf asset store item that would give them a nice drop in ui canvas widget set that would be a thousand times better. I can recognize already they have some store assets in it like curved ui - dump that if thats whats preventing you from doing it. Geeze... get real and if you can't code it spend another 50 and fix that mess or phone someone up who can.

Its truly a pain to navigate. Worse still there is no list view, which for me at least with the way it pointlessly icon views my mp3s makes it near impossible to read the file names. Which you need in order to pick a tune. And, worse you are stuck w your pick for a long time before you can ever get back to a menu to change a new one.

Terrible controls/ui. I don't seem to be able to pause or stop this game while in mid song session without remove headset and kill the task. And even then it may hose up my steamvr instance.

Yes, that part blows my mind, maybe I'm just not seeing some UI part? Or control button? but as far as I can tell, once the music starts you are committed till the game decides the track is done. So like if you are just not feelin the beat, you're stuck with it. Good luck getting a different song.

The exercise feature sounds like it would be great. But there needs to be some configuration options or something. Like make a slider adjuster for the height of the flying frames. I'm not overly tall, 5'11"". But it feels like the frames come in too low. Or it would at least be nice to adjust them based on desire/body height. Some sliders for the amount/configuation of the ball things would be nice too. Sometimes it just doesn't seem to be giving me enough of them.

And sadly to say, at least with a lot of the music I've tried with it so far... it just doesn't really feel to me like the game is following the beat very well. And some slowing/pausing effects depending on the tracks frequency/speed really can make for some boring pauses.

But also since there appears to be no ui to skip to the next track or whatever, or even skip out of the current session back to a menu, I've only been able to try a limited selection of music so far. Which as mentioned before the file nav menu is so bad I can't read half the tracks on the menu to know which one I'm about to pick until I hear it, and then you are staying with that track until it completes for however long the mp3 lasts.

For as long as this game has been out, and the hype and promo it had at release, I expected much more polish to this game.

Sorry I hate to leave negative like this but... my last session spent with this game has put me over the threshold.",76561198031481634,730,23,39,0,39,1546990019,1546992294,1546992294,False,5,0,0.574707627296447754,0,True,False,False

47947668,english,"I got my Vive setup because of Audioshield. My adult son showed it to me one day, and I decided right then I need one of these devices.  It is a great break from the work I do at home. I sit way too much and when my fitness watch tells me its been too long since I did anything, I get up and play a game. It's not that I'm a couch potato. I actually exercise over 2 hours a day, but this is simply a great addition to my routine, and I'm glad I've got it. I prefer it over BeatSaber primarily because I can use my own music with Audioshield. I've got all sorts of music from Classical, to 60's, 70's, and today. I can't do this with BeatSaber unfortunately.

I used the ""Normal"" setting only for about 9 hours of play before I began exclusively using the ""Harder"" setting. I had trouble keeping my mind focused on the game. Not because of lack of interest because I've played it for over 60 hours since getting the device, so I obviously like the game and it is still my favorite of all that I have. It's just that I'm a creative type of guy and my mind is always thinking about something new I want to do. I had to learn to focus and after trying many things for the past 3 months, I have come up what will work for me, and might work for you. Instead of expecting my mind to over time become trained to do the right thing all by itself, I finally accepted a fact I've known for a very long time. The mind can only do one thing at a time. It can do many things very quickly bu only one after another. You don't have time for your mind to think about other things when you are playing this game. There are two things which help me to get consistent high scores. The most important to me is to always keep loose. I don't let my muscles tense up when the music tempo speeds up. I'm reminding myself dozens of times during a song to stay calm and fluid. I'm making sure my shoulder muscles are not tensing up or any others for that matter. I need to focus on each orb  even if for an instant. I see them coming from the side, but they only register as an object. I don't specifically see it as red or blue. When I look straight at it, I do. By constantly and consciously looking to the right and left of my viewing area. I'm identifying specifically what is coming up next. It doesn't matter if I think there is something there or not. This forces my mind to focus on what I am doing every second or micro-second, and if you want to have perfect scores you have little choice but to learn to do this too. 

I do find it difficult to understand why so many people are complaining about the YouTube situation. Why do you think you are entitled to use something for free? Companies are in business to make money not to provide free music for everyone and every purpose. I have over 16,000 songs in my library. I couldn't possibly care less if there is a song on YouTube that I don't have but would like to use with Audioshield, and can't. If it ever did become important enough, spending a dollar or so can care of that just fine.  Just because you happen to want something and feel you have the right to have it just because you want it that way,  is not an adult way to look at things. For whatever reason, Audioshield is not able to grant your request anymore. The sensible thing to do is simply deal with it, or walk away from Audioshield. If you leave, the world is not going to end, and the rest of us will still be here and still enjoying one hell of a great game.",76561198168899696,34,6,8181,0,1116,1643145189,1546150706,1555193363,True,1,2,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

And, a point I want to make is that just because Beat Saber has come along with a new way of doing a rhythm game, doesn't mean this game isn't still relevant...it's an amazing  blast of a good time and is still unique and challenging enough that both games are great to have. 

The game is SUPER stylish and still very LEGIT even as long as it has been out.  I highly recommend it. It is still a srong competitor with Beat Saber, and I feel that it deserves way more recognition than it has had. Such a great experience.  I am just not playing it as much now with one of my Vive controllers not rumbing anymore; which of course is no fault of the game. It just makes it not as immersive with only 1 controller rumble/haptic feedback.  

Overall, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10...only lowering the score for what it used to be when it had access to YouTube play. I will still play this game now and again...and a lot more once I get haptic feedback in my other controller again.",76561197970889439,166,24,1874,0,1841,1550306504,1546077407,1546077407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

45303411,english,"There’s something to be said about custom levels in rhythm games. Designing and constructing them from the ground up takes effort and while opening tools to a modding community can produce products of ‘differing quality’, there’s always the opportunity for dedicated people to produce outstanding levels with great flow. Swinging in the opposite direction, Audioshield chooses to move with the overwhelming option to [i]generate[/i] levels from [I]any[/I]source. Disappointingly, choice to remove its compatibility with streaming services removed a large portion of quantity over quality that the game’s premise aims for. The enjoyment I got out of my time with Audioshield mainly came from digging through old tunes I had stashed away on my hard drive. I imagine that many, with streaming being so prevalent now, will not have much diversity.


On paper, using shields sounds fantastic and suitable for VR. The trailer footage made gameplay look analogous to conducting. But here, you’re not the one striking the notes, the notes are striking you. There’s a problem with the feeling and timing of that. The shields have to be preemptively place before the notes. You don’t hit the drop, you put your hand in from of it and it bounces into you with a feeble rattle. There’s no force required to break orbs or any sound to emphasize their impact, leaving the overall feel of the game to come off as unenthusiastic.


I loved being able to see far in advance the folly of incoming orbs. It’s a feature that suits itself well to the available depth-perception and carriers a unique look and ability to tellagraph notes from further out. That being said, the angle at which the orbs approach you is greater than your field of view at times. If you’re unprepared, it’s easy to miss several notes while concentrating on the far left or right.

The algorithm that runs Audioshield and its counterparts has always been of great intrigue to me and was a key attraction for purchasing the game. It merits some attention, but it ultimately outputs scattered levels that with structures potentially accredited to the placebo effect.

Audioshield provide as a great case study for both rhythm and VR games.

 - Purchased this game well before Beat Saber even existed and before YouTube integration was dropped.
 - Frequently (nearly weekly) have guests new to VR try the headset and games
 - Played on HTC Vive with 2.2m x 2.5m play area.

*** Game Feedback ***
[PROS]
 - Active gameplay, great exercise!
 - Anyone can pick up and play instantly, very simple concept
 - Randomly generated based on YOUR music, so exploring and replayability is only limited to your music tastes.

[CONS]
 - Lost YouTube integration thanks to Google's fault...
 - Few graphical issues, such as orb placement, can make it nearly impossible to ""perfectly"" complete certain song types.

*** Review ***
 > If you do NOT have personal, offline music, this game will not have much to offer.  It generates gameplay based off of your music.
 > If you want a basic introduction to music-based gameplay, this game does the trick.  Fun and great to have guests try, this game is a perfect pick-up-and-play.  (I have had many say they prefer it to Beat Saber; to each their own)
 > If you want a quick workout, this game is great.  Compared to beat saber, I find this one far more physically demanding (lots of raised arm-movements, and now squats as well!)

Sometimes the beatmaps can be hit or miss though, depending on what song you have playing. From what I've gathered, a lot of the songs on their front page/recommended are pretty good, although I'm not sure if that's a thing anymore seeing as YouTube support has been removed.

On that topic, the people dismissing the negative reviews because 'YouTube support being removed wasn't something the dev(s) wanted/it was out of their control' are missing the point. No matter how it came about, the lack of streaming support (as of writing this review) is enough to give a negative review. It's not invalid criticism and I think it's the right thing to do, because it is (or was) a pretty major feature of the game. When people come to this game page, they should know what they're getting themselves into and that they need to have mp3 files or music downloaded locally in order to listen to them. You shouldn't be concerned about hurting the developer's feelings with a negative review, as long as you're being civil and simply pointing out the state of the game to potential buyers, because they have no reason to feel upset by this and I'm sure they are working on a fix even if it's taking a while.

Overall though, I would still give this game a positive review, with the caveat that you should make sure you have the music available locally before buying (but there are tons of services that make downloading mp3s of your favourite songs much easier).

Now, even if I did warp back to the early days of Napster and Limewire to rip all the music I listen to in order to have local copies, this would not solve a major problem with the game at the moment.

Youtube was perfect for this, with Youtube integration they would look up their favorite song and jam out, not anymore I'm afraid.

-All kinds of modes from very easy to elite (Beat saber's modes depend on the user who uploaded the custom song mod, leaving new users at a disadvantage)
-Can add ANY song, and technically, still can add from youtube via YT2MP3 sites.
-Additional modes allow for casual playing or workout.


Cons:
-Hit registration, very rarely, bugs out (Or maybe it just didn't vibrate the controller and DID infact hit it, I am unsure.)

43557203,english,"If you like the look of this game, then I can tell you, it's everything you want it to be.  It will scratch that VR rhythm game itch.  It's kind of obvious this game has fallen into a hate-hole, where it's getting a bad rep because of the groupthink, but it's actually really good.  really simple, and if you are into really dancing, stretching, and working your lats, it is a little better than Beatsaber.

Without a doubt, I like this better than Beatsaber. The erratic spawning of the orbs gives a bigger challenge in my opinion.
Beatsaber IS the better game;  better graphics, better options, but the beat maps that people come up with are really not very creative for the most part.  It's not common to find one where the creator understands counter-placing the blocks to give a more exciting challenge, instead, it's usuall a symettrical, off-beat, subconciously trying to make you move less/move only your arms kind of thing.  Where Audioshield will just put you through a beating right away.  People are saying the game is abandoned, I don't think so.  Youtube flipped the table over and went home when it comes to streaming and synching options.  Last we heard, he's trying to fix that, and that may be hard to overcome, many Youtube streaming services gave up.  He may be just on hiatus while he thinks of improvements.

One thing that just weirds me out about this game, in a good way, is that the beats for the song are calculated by your computer, but always end up making you dance like the musician themselves.  You have to see it to see what I mean.
One bad thing; there is only 3 environs.  But they are templates so you can make your own very simply.
Pros:  Simple, but challenging.  One of the most maximum moving exercise games I've seen.
The beat creation is unreal.  Even when it's not perfect, it's still good.
Cons:  Only 3 locations
May need a little modding to suit your tastes.
Orbs in your peripheral are really easy to miss, in a bad way.
No combos sucks.  And the option to fail wouldn't be a bad idea.

43072626,english,"Audioshield is a good game (don't let Beat Saber ruin it for you, they are both worthwhile), however I'm going to start with the areas for improvement first in hopes something might be done to fix them to make this game WAY better.

I give it 3/5 stars (fixing the issues below would bring it to a 4/5)

Areas for improvement:
1. I really REALLY REALLY wish there was a way to visually see on the song selection menu which songs I've played before (play count or something). Whether it's a Youtube video or a song from my computer, I have no way to know if I played that song before and how much I enjoyed it. Therefore, unless I keep a written record of where I left off I will end up repeating songs I don't like. Favorites is good, but still doesn't solve the problem when exploring new music. 

2. Further to the first point, it would be great to be able to give each song a star rating and sort that way. 

3. Not sure why, but sometimes globes will pass right through my shield when I'm blocking something on the far right or left, or if I happen to be crossing the shields in a certain way. Makes it harder to get perfect combos

4. This game causes me great amounts of neck pain because of how high up the globes come from. Most of the songs they are coming down at you from a steep angle, forcing you to keep your head looking up. After long periods of time you can get strains and neck spasms. I'd recommend reducing the angle so they come less steep. This is a major no-no ergonomically and for proper posture. 

5. FIX THE YOUTUBE SEARCH! It's totally buggy to search in VR, need to use keyboard

Positives
1. Infinite music, play your own music, youtube etc

2. Gets you moving, flow is pretty good even though the globes come fairly randomly and not always timed to the beats

3.  Great replay value - if you like rhythm games. It's kind of like meditation - relaxing.

41723378,english,"If your looking for an rythem game like Audiosurf 1 but in VR your going to have to wait a bit longer and this is why:

1. there is very little coordination between the music rythem and the ""orb"" rythem. The ""orbs"" come at you at some points in rythem with the music but this is only an small amount of time when your not trying to deal with point 2. I suspect this is due to the game used a lot of Audiosurf 2 as it's basis and just put in VR as the menus are almost the same and they use Audiosurf 2's rythem system to do the ""orbs"" which is also not good compared to Audiosurf 1. (on Vive the youtube search glitchs out a ton as I couldn't even type as the typing screen flashed up and vanished each time)

2. CROSSOVER, there is a ton of crossover the higher you go in difficulty of where you end up with an sudden blue on the orange side and you miss it due to lack of gapping between the ""orbs"" or it's just too far. This could be solved by multiple modes like Audiosurf 1 however you are stuck with one mode and 3 different shields with 5 different difficulties.

3. Difficulty = more spam, yep just ends up being more ""orbs"" thrown at you with no link to the rythem or even an attempt to and so caused me to zone more on getting them rather than listening to the music rythem to get them.

4. Consistancy is nowhere, in Audiosurf 1 you can easily keep replaying an track and it would be the same everytime making it so that you could learn it and become better, that is in this to an small degree of where you see patterns but there is a lot of difference in each playthrough no matter what difficulty it is.

5. Easy to ""cheat""Final point is that you can just do one thing to make any of the modes easy and get 90%+ most of the time and that is to just hold up both controllers together infront of your self and boom everything hits them. There will be some at different angles which will require some movement but even if you ignore them and focus on holding them where the main amount is, your good. The Gladiator shield is the best for playing when you want to switch between this and atcually moving your hands around as they have the front bubble and then side bits which end up providing a lot of coverage when you need it.

So please don't get this thinking Audiosurf 1 in VR and it will be awsome....it's Audiosurf 2 with lazy mode put in to just ride on the VR movement and so for excersing in VR I recomend Space Pirate Trainer in stead as it's lazy mode is hide in shields but that doesn't progress you.",76561198077990240,466,8,84,0,84,1524857845,1524862110,1524862110,False,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

I've always wanted to like rhythm games but never could, then I played Hatsune Miku VR and fell in love with it so I figured maybe I'd give some other VR rhythm games a shot. Maybe being in VR was the missing factor in my inability to like rhythm games... This one seems popular but I just don't see the appeal unless it's just a case of there not being much else available.

Pros:

1) You can play any music with it since it uses a procgen to create beatmaps.

Cons:

1) The procgen beatmaps are terrible. They don't feel like they have anything to do with the music you're listening to at all. I tried a bunch of different difficulties and ""Harder"" seemed to be the best with regard to the speed and complexity of the beatmaps. Casual, Normal and Hard were snoozeville and ""Elite"" is just annoying. ""Harder"" should be ""Normal"", ""Elite"" should be ""Elite"" and there should be an intermediate difficulty between those two for ""Hard"", honestly.

2) The pace of the beats is very awkward. They speed up and slow down constantly. The tempo of the song should dictate the frequency of the beats, not their speed. This is a very awkward way to play a rhythm game.

3) The lack of feedback for hitting and missing. Or I should say, the lack of *good* feedback. If you hit, there's a huge splash of color (which annoyingly obscures the screen a little too much) and haptic vibration and when you miss there is nothing but a line showing the direction that the orb you missed came from. There should be an option for audio cues so it actually feels like you're engaged with the music.

4) There should also be an option for how much of a variance there can be for the vertical angle the beats can come from. Sometimes you spend half the song staring almost straight up. It's uncomfortable and doesn't add anything to the experience.

5) There are only 3 stages.

If you're interested in this game, I will say I've heard it's better with mods so maybe look into those but, overall, I can't recommend the game in it's stock form.

41599222,german,"Also das ist es nun?
Ich hab es durch trailer und gameplay videos schon immer gemerkt aber war mir natürlich nicht sicher... das Spiel muss langweilig sein.

Das feedback für getroffene Bälle ist nur ein kleiner Ruckler am Vive controller und jede menge meiner Meinung nach hässlicher Partikel-Spam Effekte. Ich hatte zu fast keinem Zeitpuntk den Eindruck, die Musik würde synron mit dem laufen was man tut. Der Generator/Algorythmus hierzu ist offenbar sehr sehr simpel.

Die Welten sind steril, langweilig und reaktionslos zur Musik. Ein bisschen haben im Menü die Sterne zum beat geflackert, nichts wirklich außergewöhnliches.

Das visuelle clipping der Schilde ist katastrophal. Wenn man die controller zueinander zu nahe hält, und das sind ungefähr schon <15cm, dann clippen die Schilde ineinander was einfach nur schlecht aussieht. Kommt dann noch der lila plane hinzu, dann clippen insgesamt 3 farbige meshes ineinander. Ohne jeglichen Effekt natürlich. Sichtbares clipping sollte nie zu sehen sein..... hier wäre mehr Mühe/Liebe zum detail angebracht gewesen.
Hält man also beide Controller nahe zueinander erscheint (effektlos) ein lila Schild das man benötigt, um lila Bälle zu schlagen.

Aus technischer Sicht empfinde ich das FOV der Vive (sowie Rift) mit 110° für das Spiel zu klein. Zu oft kommen die Bälle aus einem totel Winkel auf den Spieler zu und werden somit verpasst.

Insgesamt fühlt sich das Spiel wie eine lieblos und vor allem kurzzeitig zusammengebastelte DEMO an. Der Inhalt ist mikrig und innovativ ist hier auch nichts.
Meine Bewegungen haben sich stark in Grenzen gehalten, man muss sich schon fast zwingen in der zwischenzeit während man auf die Bälle wartet, sinnlos in der Gegend zu hampeln.

Im großen und ganzen fehlt mir einfach knallhart das feedback wenn ich Bälle treffe. Es passiert im Spiel einfach VIEL zu wenig.

41365299,english,"Let me preface by saying this: I LOVE rhythm games. I've been playing them for 10+ years. When this game is good, it's really good.

However:
1. It's almost never good. :(
Most of the time (at least in the songs I have tried), the ""bullets"" coming in aren't timed to the music. I'm sure I'll like it better once I find a sufficient number of songs that actually keep you moving to the beat instead of moving randomly while music plays. It's really, really jarring for something that markets itself as a rhythm game. For this reason, I have a hard time motivating myself to play this at all.

2. In my opinion, the menus are clunky and very unpolished. This doesn't feel like a finished product - the interface is something I'd expect out of an early access game (and many of those aren't anywhere near this bad).

That all being said, I'm really glad I bought it... on sale. I definitely would've returned this if I'd paid full price.

[*]You feel like a badass when you have a storm of notes flying at you. The particle effects are fantastic.
[*]This game is the ultimate for freeform movement. Wanna spin round and hit notes from behind? Do it. Punch every single note as if you were boxing? Choose the Cestus Brawler gloves and have at it.
[*]Modding. You need a mod for this game if you want it to feel the best. The default settings feel underwhelming and hilariously off-time in comparison to other auto-generation games out there. Fortunately, Discookie's Insane mod is perfect for this. You can even adjust the settings so that it's not ""hard"", but just feels better.
[/list]

[h1]The bad:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Miss feedback is bad. It's just a solid coloured bar that appears over the top of the game. It blocks your view of the oncoming notes and takes you out of it. This used to be better, but it was changed for some reason.
[*]The built-in support for YouTube is janky at best. If you're playing a song, it has about a 50/50 chance of being slightly off-beat. You don't have this problem with local MP3 files. On top of this, if you play a YouTube song that nobody has played before, you have to wait [i]more than a minute[/i] to start playing.
[*]No built-in playlist feature. This is more of a QoL adjustment, seeing as you can organise your MP3s into folders if you want this functionality, but it does interrupt a workout.

Dylan, I know you're a busy person, and this is a one-man project, but in this world of accessible developers and social media, you seem to be hidden away and just not involved in the community surrounding this game. I hope that you read this, and start to listen/respond to feedback more often. Give us all an understanding of what you wanted to accomplish with this game, and what plans you have for it.
I was so excited for the future possibilities that this game could have, but over the almost two years that I've been playing, nothing much has changed from an external perspective. There's still so much that could be improved and polished.

[h1]All in all:[/h1]
This game's great. I still recommend this game over any other VR rhythm game if your goal is to [i]feel great[/i]. If you want a proper workout, BoxVR is better. If you want anime-style dance troupe gameplay, Holodance. If you wanna have structured dance moves, a la Just Dance, Soundboxing.

Audioshield is definitely one of my favourite games in VR and reminds me of Audiosurf because, well, it's basically the same thing. Out of the VR rhythm games I've played Audioshield is best for versatility, allowing you to play with whatever music or YouTube video you can find. It also makes you feel like you're an epic hero saving the world from an alien invasion of bubbles! However, I often find that the generation of bubbles can be... Strange. Sometimes you'll get a stream of red bubbles to the far right immediately followed by a red bubble to the far left. I'm not really sure how anyone is able to hit those. It seems impossible to me. Perhaps it's a flaw with me and not the game but it does make it a little frustrating; it certainly doesn't feel like it's me. The game is also just as repetitive and samey as Audiosurf so it certainly isn't something you spend hours on everyday. I have also found that of all the games I've played, aside from Climbey, Audioshield glitches the most often. However, this could be my set up? I'm not sure. The shield sometimes move out of my hands and the game pauses with a grey screen causing me to miss some bubbles I otherwise wouldn't. This doesn't happen as often in other games. It usually only happens during the first song I play for the session though, maybe the whole machine just needs to warm up lol.

That being said it is one of my favourite games for a reason. It's fun, energising and a great way of warming up for much more challenging games like BOXVR and Sprint Vector (both of which I also recommend, but they certainly need you to warm up and I always warm up with Audioshield). I tried warming up with Holoball today but because it requires full body movement and I was feeling lazy going into my play session I felt no motivation to chase the ball flying at me.I switched to Audioshield for a couple songs and was immediately in the zone even though I did worse than usual at blocking the bubbles.

As a relaxing game, a way to listen to music and move at the same time (because you know, we need something to help us with that obviously  lol) and my personal favourite warm up game Audioshield is the best.

39467558,english,"Me: Rhythm game with tracks I can choose freely from? AWESOME!
Narrator: As it turned out, it wasn't awesome.

English isn't my native, please be gentle. 

I would say I was pretty hyped to play AUDIOSHIELD, because it's often mentioned when there is a ""TOP 10 GAMES"" of VR. I played Guitar Hero on the Wii so I thought I'd get a similar feeling while playing (reads: to feel as being one with the music), but there is one big issue for it and that's - rhythm.
The ONLY thing this game is being expected from is that you, beating the orbs, are in sync with the beat you're listening to, but exactly there, it fails. 

Most of the time it felt like I was beating orbs which have nothing to do with the music that currently plays. And that is, mildly speaking, boring. 

First I tried the two first choices I was presented with and then chose ""This cannot continue"" from the NieR: Automata OST. The last one has some parts with heavy emphasis on the beat and I had expected that this is one of the tracks where the game can shine the most. 
For example: the singing voice has a few long streched out words, before the last one's are sung with a heavy tonation on each word and it all ends with a final ""HUAH!"" shout (like the last part of the FUS-RO-DAH). The change of tone your hear of these three parts wasn't converged into the orbs flying to me. At all. At least for the last shout you would expact a single big bubble you have to block, but it's merged into one big ""tube"" to block with the rest of before.
For the rest, most of the time you beat bubbles out of sync to the music beat.

Visually, it is okay. The bubbles look crappy but the particle effects the moment you block them give you a nice feedback for your success (with the controller rumble).


I had no time to play it within two weeks, otherwise I would have refunded it.

However 2 years later after moving into my new house and firing this game up again hoping to play some of my new favorite songs, I was very disappointed to discover the Youtube feature is no longer there.  The only way you can play your favorite songs now is to have them installed on your computer somewhere.  Otherwise you're stuck with the included songs in the game.  I don't store music on my computer anymore, and in fact some of my favorite songs I don't have digital copies of.

ORIGINAL REVIEW - 1/9/2018

This game is extremely fun.  Its a simple concept but the fact you can use virtually any song makes the replay value endless.  I finally got around to playing it last night after picking this up on the Steam winter sale, and it was worth every penny and more.  In fact even at the regular price, I think its worth the cost.

You can use music from your personal library, pre selected songs, or you can use youtube videos.  I had a blast and I will be playing more today.

I probably look like an idiot playing this game to observers, but I don't care, this game is amazing.  If you like rhythm games like guitar hero, piano tiles, then this is a must buy.

But in reality this is a pretty fun rhythm game if you're looking for something that allows you to play any song you want without needing to download them. There are a few problems I have with the game and the biggest and most notable one is that the beats don't match up with the music very well all the time.

Beats usually attach to drum hits and anything quieter wont be mapped at all. Including vocals. More intense songs don't have enough notes because there's just too much musical density. I would also prefer it if there were more than just the regular beat simultanious hits. I would like to see the rapid / slider notes have some simultanious variants.

The UI is finicky and unrefined, the hit detection can be a bit off when the shields are held closer to you, but the big one: the beat generation is pretty bad. This is really noticably when you get in the zone, and start moving with the music more. Often times the beats don't feel aligned with the most impactful movements of the song. Song's got thundering bass? Well we're gonna follow the weak little melody. And then when it does get the beats of the song right, they feel off. The genres I was playing with were modern electronic, as well as some 90s techno.

The other big one, I think the play testers for this game were all taller than me. I'm short, and hitting some beats can be challenge because they're out of reach of my handspan. THis happens especially often during sections which require you to cross your arms.

I've noticed it's different for different songs so I wonder if there's something in the algorithm that decides this (I'm pretty sure it has to do with volume or speed). This isn't terrible once you get used to it but still not my favorite.

Second, the song accuracy is not quite there yet. I'd say it's probably about 80%. When it works, it's absolutely amazing and there are times where I've hit the perfect groove and it's one of the greatest experience VR has to offer. When it doesn't work, it's confusing and a bit frustrating. A lot of this seems to stem from the difficulty setting, which I'll get into later.

Third, the hit detection doesn't always seem right. It seems the shield has to collide properly with a certain portion of the orb, which causes grief when you actually hit the orb but don't pass that threshold and it counts as a miss. I've also noticed that if I swing and sort of slap an orb, it doesn't usually count. I'm not sure if I'm just not hitting it or if that's not detected properly, but it bothers me.

Fourth, I think the difficulties need to be tweaked to provide better challenges. It seem like the game is balanced around the middle difficulty, with that appearing to be the intended way to play and the most in-tune with the algorithm. The lower difficult just has less orbs, and the higher difficult has more orbs (to a fault sometimes). Often the higher difficulty throws hand-crossing orbs in such rapid succession I'm doubtful it's actually physically possible. It also occasionally throws orbs at you from outside your peripheral vision, which is kind of a dick move. The middle difficulty is really the sweet spot, but sometimes I can't help but wish for more orbs, as long as they were fair in in logical patterns.

Fifth, the choices for environment and shields are pretty crappy. I picked the top ones when I started and none of the others feel right. This might be just because I've gotten used to the game like that, but honestly the stage and beach environments feel really distracting and off.

Sixth, I would love some support for putting together playlists so I can play songs consecutively. I like to use this as a way to get myself active and doing albums is my favorite way to play. If not that, I'd like support for longer songs (I think it caps at about an hour) and support for cue/flac rips.

Overall I loved the game, although it's not perfect and feels a little light (sale price of $10 is fair). It looks like the dev just put out an update after about a year of inactivity so here's to hoping we get more in the future!",76561198025696276,795,187,486,0,310,1588956612,1514675768,1515733544,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

38098639,english,"July Update: The developer removed the YouTube option with no explanation as to why or if it will be coming back. The silence and lack of communication states volumes and is very saddening. Game cannot be recommended on its own unless you already own a robust music library. I would recommend Beat Saber over this anymore. While it also doesn't have a streaming option, the gameplay has a much better frame work than Audioshield does and it much funner in that sense. There are many custom songs for it as well. 



Old Review: 80/100. Game is fantastic, but it has its flaws. The primary of them being that interaction with the menu is a pain. An inability to log into your Youtube account and play preselected playlists and that the modified Youtube search that this browser uses is quite obnoxious as song titles have to be rather exact to find what your looking for.

I understand the reason for the later or at least I assume I do. The reason I would assume is so that the leaderboards are more populated and thus I'm rather mixed on this as I really, really like the leaderboards.

Intergration into streaming services would be the best thing that this game could implement. I understand the limitations of it needing to parse the song entirely before beginning and whatnot, but surely there could be a way to work around this by working with these streaming services?

At least in an ideal world. Unlikely to happen given the all the IP restrictions on music so I won't place much blame on the developer. Just makes me sad at how wonderful it would be. Also would be good for the leaderboards so that there aren't duplicates as there are on Youtube. 

I would recommend the game. Even at asking price. If looking for something liesurely to pass the time, maybe not. Especially if you aren't in shape and don't care to get in shape. Game on low difficulties is rather boring. At high difficulties it is tense, fast pace, and unforgiving. Gets your blood pumping and can definitely get a good sweat going. An unfortunate thing with the Vive foam pads as they do soak. I like to run a fan swiveling towards me.

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/MMG53Yi6lSo

When I first purchased Audioshield, back in 2017, it was widely considered the best VR music rhythm games. Once Beat Saber released, that was no longer the case. Since then, Audioshield has actually gotten worse as an experience with the loss of YouTube integration. Is Audioshield still worth getting?

I would say maybe, but only on a deep, deep sale ($8 bucks or preferably less). It's still fun as a workout where you can listen to your tunes. You pretty much do have to bring your own music as the included music soundtrack is pretty forgettable. There are mods you can download though (I don't include detailed discussion of mods unless it's a game like Garry's Mod or HLA where the mods are included by the dev themselves). 

The problem is the computer algorithm for the beatmaps just isn't as good as the beat maps from the top VR music rhythm games, that are mostly hand-crafted. Also, the core gameplay is just too simple compared to the current generation of VR music rhythm games like Beat Saber, Audio Trip, Synth Riders, OhShape, etc. Compared to those games, Audioshield just looks dated now. A VR game from a bygone era .... 2016. This game is still fun for a workout with tunes, but it's not good when thinking about beatmaps that actually enhance the musical experience or make you feel like you're dancing versus just playing a competitive game of chasing the leaderboard to music. 

Audioshield is running on the Unity Engine and it was running at a steady 90 frames per second for me on my 1060 GTX. I experienced zero issues (well, except on WMR where it seemed that less than a full battery charge on motion controllers caused issues with the hit detection, but I'll blame WMR versus the game). The visuals and backgrounds, however, are also a bit dated now in 2020. 

Audioshield is good for nostalgia reasons for some. I just can't recommend this over many other VR music rhythm games. It's definitely a buy on deep, deep sale only neutral recommendation. It's not bad, it's just that there's so many much better VR music rhythm games now. This was seen as the best VR music rhythm game back in 2016 by many (I only started playing in 2017 so it was never my favorite), but now in 2020 it wouldn't even crack my top 20 list of VR music rhythm games.

I remembered I had about 8gb of music on an old flashdrive and uploaded them. Just a bunch of favorites.
I do have to say this one is my favorite VR game. The trailer on Steam is pretty accurate other that not being able to capture the full aspect of VR. Play is stationary, i.e. you can stand in one area as long as you have the abilty to reach out with your arms in an ~120 degree arc, so not overly wide. A bit of overhead so be careful of ceiling fans.
Gameplay is simple, you hit the incoming blue and orange (red) dots, you get points on accuracy, style, and punch power. This is also a great arms workout (I'm thinking of adding some weight straps just for effect).  The hand units vibrate briefly when you strike an orb adding to effect.

The ability to play your own selection of music means you can easily get lost in the groove, and this obviously adds a lot of variety. The beat detection algorithm isn't perfect, but for the most part is perfectly adequate if the quality of the audio reccording is sufficient - garbage in, garbage out. With a bit of practice, you can soon learn how the algorithm is treating each song and focus on those elements; once you figure this out, you can start throwing some great shapes :) Scores are submitted to the global leaderboards, and you can choose to ignore them, or try to get yourself to the top, adding a further layer of replayability. The difficulty levels scale reasonably well, from normal mode where you won't have to cross your arms and can almost stand still, to Elite level where - with the right sort of song - you will be active for every second, with frantic flapping of arms and bouncing around your playspace...

Whilst the ability to play any song adds almost infinite replayability and variety, the lack of arenas makes thigns a bit ""samey"", and if your local music library is not organised very well you will not have fun navigating the interface (though there is a working search function!!), but these are very minor points and in no way impact the actual gameplay which is itself, flawless, in my opinion.

It's also an excellent demo/introduction to VR; there is no involuntary movement so relatively free from nausea problems, the concept is very easy to understand, the normal mode is very forgiving, new players can try it out on a song they know/love and this really aids in getting comfortable with the VR environment.

If you own a VR headset and enjoy listening to music, you can do a lot worse than picking this up, sale price or not. You can become Lord of the Dance too...

The notes or beats of the song being played are visualised as blue and orange orbs and fly at you at different heights and directions. You punch or block them out to the beat of the song. It's that simple. It never seems to get old. Once you master the vanilla game there are mods which honestly should be a part of the main game, Check out the rythm+workout mod, it's outstanding! 

There are some improvements I'd like to see. Right now when the song is over you have to go back to main menu to select a new one.

The game has no progression or story or anything like that.  It's just a standard rhythm game.

There are many sections of songs that are totally random, or constantly switching between the harmony, high percussion, underlying percussion, and utter nonsense.

Hopefully there'll be more features down the road, just some ideas from the top of my head:

Increase graphic fidelity or amount of ""balls"" the higher your streak is (for feeling awesome).
Dynamic difficulty, the higher your streak or the better your technique, you'll see an increase in balls or more range on them.
Adding an API that both allows to expand on the music library but also modes, arenas, difficulties, shields and everything. Hell, playing your cards well, this could also be a music played Arkanoid or Space Invaders.
Add more options and possibilities to turn it into a proper workout.
Make it possible to switch shield colour by the press of a button, to get the hard to get balls.

However there are also a few downsides:
- When playing Youtube songs, the game gets stuck at loading the song from time to time (mostly after about 5 or 6 songs) and I have to shut it down. That's annoying as the recent songs and favorites are not saved. So I manually close Audioshield after 4 songs to avoid this.
- The search in Youtube only delivers a handful of songs and it is hard to find the version of a song you want. It would be great to be able to add Youtube links to the favorites outside VR.
- For some videos on Youtube the game tells me that the song has to be processed as it is started the first time and it would not happen the next time. It happens every time I start these videos and takes quite a while.
Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVgSuuUTwQ

So even if the game is really nice and fun to play, the downsides are pretty annoying for me. But I still recommend it, especially if you don't encounter the stuck issue when loading the songs.

33691433,english,"Audioshield is one of the best games I have played in a long time. I used to love DDR when I was a teenager, and this game is like a VR version for your arms, except it's even better because you aren't limited by song choice. You can play any audio with it, which I absolutely love!! This game has helped me actually enjoy exercising again for the first time in years. Because of that, it is also helping me with my depression and anxiety which is this incredible and unexpected benefit that I cannot thank you guys enough for.

I have been obsessively playing this game almost every day since we got our VR headset at the beginning of this month (and felt ridiculously deprived for the week when we had no headset because we decided to return the VIVE and get the Rift instead.) I'm absolutely in love with this game. Because of that, I have a few suggestions that I really think would make it even better.

First, I wish there was a way to adjust the height/width of the playing area and the shoulder level of the game. Sometimes, the red and blue spheres come flying from so high above me that my neck is craned way, way back to the point where it really hurts my neck and shoulders and they start to cramp up. If there were a way to manually set a limiter for that it would be such a relief. It doesn't even need to be adjusted that much; I enjoy that the height changes throughout the song, it just goes too far back for me and it becomes painful. I know I can take a step back behind the shoes on the ground as a sort of ""quick fix"" but it doesn't completely work because then the spheres are flying into the wrong area and then I find myself bending forward in an awkward position instead of it being the fluid dance that it usually is. If we could set our own parameters so that it fits our unique body that would be so nice. Same thing with the horizontal area from left to right. Because the edges of the headset don't allow for as much peripheral vision as we have in real life, I am constantly noticing a sphere here and there wayyyy off to the side that completely escaped my attention and I missed it because it was out of the range of my peripheral vision and I didn't even know it was there. It's not the end of the world, but it's definitely frustrating when you know that you wouldn't have missed it if you had actually been able to see it. I love how the game has a wide playing area, but for me I feel like it just needs to be slightly smaller to be comfortable. I wouldn't mind having the option for the spheres to go lower than they currently do, either.

And as a way to make that whole idea even more user friendly, you could also allow us to set multiple profiles within the game so that if multiple people in the household play the game often, they don't have to constantly manually adjust these settings each time they switch. They can just select their profile (shoulder level, playing area size, etc.) and go. And I wish you could switch between steam accounts easily under one game setup. My fiance and I play most of our VR games through his account (this one) because it's just easier. But now all of my high scores are under his account so I don't get bragging rights. It's too much of a pain to switch between steam accounts all the time so I just don't worry about it. Still, though!

Okay, and one more super cool idea. I'm sure everyone keeps telling you that you need more places to play (since there are only currently 3 locations to select from.) Well, what if, rather than having to make a whole bunch of new locations, you just made it compatible with Steam VR Environments?? Then anyone could choose from any environment they love, download directly to the game, and play there! That would really take Audioshield to a whole new level!!!

Last but not least... I think that at some point there needs to be an even harder level than Elite. It is still wonderfully challenging, but some songs are so much better than others (pattern-wise) and there are songs I would love to play but even on elite they are just too slow between spheres. And some songs where there are really challenging parts (usually when the music picks up) but there are still long sections of the song where there are less spheres and it gets a little boring. And then there are songs that are really hard throughout the whole song and I LOVE that. Every time I find a song that is challenging the whole way through I'm like YESSSSS!!! The best part of this game is that it not only challenges your body to keep up, but it also challenges your brain. I'd rather do harder levels, even if I miss more, because my brain stays so focused and entertained in addition to the exercise I'm getting. That's the part that keeps me coming back for more!

Thank you again for making this game -- it is absolutely fantastic!! I LOVE IT!

This game is based around music, as you can tell by 'audio'shield. Many reviews below me complain about the game's lack of mapping to the beat, in which I say they've either only played on the lowest difficulty (the least amount of orbs to hit, therefore lacking the beat), only played on shite songs that dont have a defined beat, or a combination of the two.

It's really quite simple when it comes to the 'audio-tracking.' Pick a song with a defined beat and you'll be fine. Pick something thats either incredibly slow or muffled, and the program will have some difficulty.

33352714,english,"I tried Holodance, Soundboxing and Audioshield. I would say Audioshield is the game with the “most covenience factor.”

You can just jump in, find a YouTube song and play. All the beatmaps are created by an algorithm, and if the song was never played by anyone before, Audioshield will scan it and create the beatmap for you. 

The game doesn't require third party programs to access music libraries and it doesn't require people to create beatmaps for you (or it doesn't require you to create one). Sounds good so far and it's the main reason I like Audioshield – there is little upkeep required.

Since the beatmaps are created by an algorithm you can choose difficulty, so you can start slow and work your way up the difficulty levels, again a good thing about using an algorithm VS user made beatmaps. This also lets you avoid silly beatmap, where the person who created it does something very complicated that it is really not intuitive at all.

While I seem to praise Audioshield's algorithm, I didn't really touch on the quality of its beatmaps which greatly varies from song to song. Audioshield seems to work best with classical music (for example try the Star Wars soundtrack), especially when there are no vocals. Volume seems to be the factor that influences beats the most.

Audioshield will always throw you beats that correspond to something in the song, but what it does throw at you changes from attempt to attempt and it can be seemingly random. One time you will have to punch your way through the bass. The next it will be two beats from the base, one from a word it picked on, 1 from the drums, 1 from the guitar. This makes it seem like the beats are not on the rhythm. It is also very apparent that the algorithm can't fully distinguish the various instruments. Sadly, I don't think it's possible to code an algorithm that can do that perfectly, unless the instruments are saved on separate tracks. This is essentially what Holodance does for their story mode songs – they separate the instruments and then map them.

Movement wise, Audioshield is my favourite. You use more of your virtual canvas than the other two games, certainly more than Soundboxing. You can make very large and sweeping movements, thing which you can do with Holodance, but Audioshield does it to a bigger degree. The bigger canvas however does present the issue of missing some beats because they were out of your field of view. It also presents issues at higher difficulties, where you have to touch to beats on the opposite sides of your “canvas” with the same hand in a VERY short time. I lost count of the amount of times I yelled, “I don't bend that way!”

Although I do lean towards a particular music genre, my taste in music is fairly eclectic, so I find I can't stick to only playing Audioshield because some of the songs I want to play work better in Soundboxing. But when I am tired to play U2, Anastacia or ACDC in Soundboxing, and I want to play Singing In The Rain or the Star Wars Imperial March – Audioshield is definitely my go to.",76561198016440082,294,48,1299,0,269,1542226948,1499457640,1499457640,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Just picked it up in the Steam Summer Sale and all I can say is WOW! Perhaps it's because I'm into clubbing muisic or that I'm a musician but this game is among the very best I've played on VR. I never expected the game to generate the entire melody as items to hit, but everything is in time and occasionally it will add in melody parts. However this could be the game's strength because you actually feel as though you are playing a different instrument part that is still in time. Playing on the harder setting gives a much greater degree of satisfaction and I look forward to being able to try Elite mode. The feeling of completing a purple shield block (both hands) followed by a long stream is amazing. VR games are all about how they make you feel and this hits the spot. 

I had some initial issues with crashing which were resolved by opting into Steam VR Beta as per the pinned support notice.

Audioshield is a suprisingly fun upgrade to Audiosurf 2. I rather enjoy the Hard and Elite difficulties, it's a great game to just put on as a warm up or even just to play for an hour or too. As with AS2, the game relies on your own tracks to generate a level for you which is pretty much the best thing about this game as you can find a track that's right for you and just mess with each of the difficulty settings.

The game basically works by giving you a shield in each hand, left is blue, right is orange and you use them to hit the corresponding colours flying towards you, occasionally bringing the two colours together to make a shield to hit purple orbs.

Honestly the game seems to function more like a work-out routine, a few songs on the higher difficulties and you're already sweating bullets, it's fantastic. Tracking of the headset and controllers is smooth as anything and I've had no major issues with the game aside from the occasional weird shake in the menus and you don't need a large play space either.

I'd definitely recommend giving this game a go, especially if you've got a decent music library of fast/upbeat tracks (although there's an option to use YouTube too!)

Overall, I'd give it an 8/10, a fun experience that could do with a few modes (maybe Workshop content like AS2) and maybe some harder difficulties without needing to mod the game to do so.",76561198136294393,261,12,5,0,5,1499194222,1499194251,1499194251,True,0,0,0.49751242995262146,0,True,False,False

I directly need to say Audioshield was the worst of them. 

1.	Airtone (most expensive, great look and gameplay, limited songs) Highly recommended!
2.	Holodance (really really great, nearby nr. 1 and by far nr. 2) Highly recommended!
x (Soundboxing - can not recommand at this time as it is very buggy, uploading beatmaps does not work and virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users)
3.	Beats Fever 
4.	Audioshield

Audioshield: it did not feel like a rhythm game at all and it had only a few sound-stages. The gameplay was not in sync with the music as the algorithm does not do that well. Every game with predefined beatmaps is far superior. You Tube integration does not help. Gameplay feels often chaotic and shallow.

Soundboxing: Gameplay felt more serious as in Audioshield. It has user made beatmaps and a youtube integration. You can easily create beatmaps to your own favorite songs and share them. It has 12 different show-stages. -- Can not be recommanded atm as uploading beatmaps does not work and the virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users --

Beats Fever: Good looking environments, 40 songs with predefined beatmaps. Songs are a bit generic, gameplay is okay but does not feel that organic. A bit chaotic at times. 

Holodance: with Osu! integration, great looking, fun gameplay, definitely one of the best. Through Osu integration nearby infinite gameplay. Highly recommended!

Airtone: Best rhythm game out there, if you can life with Japanese pop. It has the best rhythm gameplay of all of them: you have to punch/slap the notes, just holding the stick in the direction is not enough; your punches/slaps make a sound when you hit so you hear the rhythm you are beating (not just a short vibration), the presentation is very beautiful, every song has three difficult levels, all in all very fun and addictive. 25 Tracks included.

When that happens it can be very satisfying, and definitely a good work-out. I recommend playing it on the highest diffulty where that is more likely to happen. Lower difficulty levels often leave out important notes which the song itself emphasizes.

The orbs sometimes speed up and slow down based on the music, which is quite annoying, because you have to unlearn a life-time of understanding of conservation of momentum.
There are also situations where it feels like the game misses collisions (those situations feel different from just missing), which can be frustrating.

32964496,english,"I'd like to start this off saying that this is an incredible game. It allows you to pick ANY youtube video and have it convert to notes and have you dance to it. It gives an incredible workout and makes you feel like a total boss climbing up the leaderboard. That said there are a couple complaints. The main being frequent crashes. Sometimes when I am in a game the thing starts to glitch. For some reason some songs are worse than others. I play this one song ([Sukone Tei] Psychotic Love Song) and while it is one of the most amazing songs for audioshield, it tends to crash halfway through. I am able to play for long periods of time but the game gives way to many crashes. A couple days the video searching function didn't work. My only other complaints are the lack of variety and it being easy. Sometimes I put some really intense songs.....only to have the notes go very slow. It ruins the groove and I can't play some songs I otherwise really enjoy. As for the lack of variety, there are only blue notes, red notes, and purple notes. Sometimes you hold them in one spot but that's about it. In a FEW (As in like 3) songs I found spots where the long notes curve and have this little twist. If there were more things like that then the songs would be more interesting. 

Interesting ideas:
-Times where you have to completely freeze (Hopefully matching quiet parts of some intense songs like right before the beat drops)
-Certain notes that you have to dodge (Whole body if possible)
-Green notes (maybe another color) that make you have to move your hands in certain patterns
-Community-made notes that will fit songs. Like, you could go with the actual formula or choose a pattern someone else made

There are some things that could be improved upon. 

I've noticed that there are a lot of complaints about the game being too easy. From what I've noticed, the better quality audio source, the harder the game is. Many people use the YouTube stream feature for play, where the audio is heavily compressed. It seems that the game does not read each note as precisely as if you use a music file from your computer. I've also noticed that, while using music from your computer, there is a difference in difficulty between bit rates. I have played the same track in 128 kbps MP3, 128 kbps OGG, 350 kbps OGG, and 16 bit WAV. The WAV file had a somewhat steeper difficulty curve compared to the lesser formats. All were significantly harder than anything played from YouTube.

Musical genre has a large impact on the difficulty of the game. A track such as Current Value - Loner played on hardest difficulty will be significantly more challenging that something like Armin Van Buuren - Drowning. I'm not sure if this was an intentional design practice, or something that happened as a result of programming limitations, but either way you spin it, if you want to have the game be more challenging, play faster songs with more complex drum patterns.

Pros:

[olist]
    [*]Music library is virtually limitless!  Use your own songs! This freedom is easily the best part of this game.
    [*]The stages are abstract and can make it easy to focus on the music.  I personally prefer the type of stages you'd find in Beats Fever, but this is at least less likely to lag.
    [*]Great optimizations and a professional level polish to the menu UI.  Everything is easy to understand and runs smoothly on both my Phenom II X4 955 and my Ryzen 1600X, though I find that the YouTube streaming hiccups a lot on my older hardware, pausing every 30-45 seconds to buffer.
    [*]Recommendations seem to be on-point a lot of the time with fast-paced songs and songs which just sound really cool.  When I bought this, I kept telling myself I would use my own mp3 library, but I find it easier to just play the recommended songs from YouTube.  The YouTube songs often come with lyrics, too, which is a nice bonus.
[/olist]

Cons: 

[olist]
    [*]Note orbs often do not fit the music.  Note orbs move eradically, pausing for no particular reason and moving at different speeds to hinder your timing.  I prefer notes move toward you at a constant speed so I can plan ahead.
    [*]The difficulty levels can be very hard or very easy and often not anywhere inbetween.  I found the game too easy and not fun enough unless I played in Harder or higher difficulty, but some songs aren't as accurate as others and the difficulty settings are there to help alleviate that.
    [*]I found myself getting worn out trying to swing my arms into the right position to get the right color, because the colors of notes and their position are totally random.
    [*]You're limited to just 3 stages, and they're mostly abstract scenery, aside from the concert stage, which is decidedly low quality.  I would like to see different levels of quality for each stage and more stages to choose from.  I'd be happy to pay for that as a DLC, too.
    [*]There's no way to add your own custom note tracks for songs from what I can tell.  It would be really cool to see user-generated tracks for popular songs.

Overall, this game is great.  Audioshield gives me a lot more replay value than Beats Fever does.  It's a good buy, even at full price, but definitely consider other music games, too!",76561197997801929,2597,368,1491,0,92,1527199592,1497825883,1501777055,True,16,0,0.681928694248199463,0,True,False,False
32488890,english,"Bottom line up front this is a fun game that gets you up and moving, HOWEVER, it doesn't work as advertised. For a rhythm game, it really has a hard time keeping the onscreen obstacles with the rhythm. 

I've seen reviews saying it crashes and freezes, I haven't had one issue with it so far, runs perfect for me. I've also seen reviews saying it's a great work out and you'll have sweat running down your face, maybe if you're in very poor shape, like don't normally move around much shape. 

This is a game that is on the highest rated VR games and best sellers, so I maybe put a little too much stock in and set my expiations too high on the ""puts you at the point of impact for every hit in your music"" tag line. So that’s what I was expecting, something that kept time and felt like I was visually playing the music. I tried popular music, recommended music from the game, most popular songs used, my own downloaded music and any every list in the game to see if it got any better. But it’s only accurate when there’s heavy beat with little to no other instruments or music in the song.

When the song picks up, the game is just all over the place. Not really throwing the obstacles with the beat or rhythm, just throwing random balls and whatever as what I'm assuming is the software losing track of what's going on. That’s what I’m also assuming about this game, it’s just trying to “guess” what to display on screen based on the song selected. But it seems like the software has a hard time trying to determine what to do most of the time and you just end up hitting random bubbles out of rhythm.

As most songs pick up you just find yourself playing a whack a mole game to a song you picked instead of an actual rhythm game. Usually in the intro and outro of most songs it keeps the beat and rhythm very well. Though, the game does substitute the lack of accuracy with the bubbles staying on beat with having the speed of them change with the tempo of the music, that's what the game does best in my opinion. 

But the game is fun, even out of rhythm and beat you're often challenged with the left right left left oh right again, nope wrong color game play. As the bubble obstacles zoom in to your position you end up just reacting at times like something is actually coming at you, so the game does a very good job with the depth and feel of it all. 

I know it sounds like I’m bashing the game, but don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy playing the game. I was having fun but something seemed off. That does hamper on the “fun” of it as you find yourself just punching randomness to a song you picked instead of going with the rhythm of the song you picked. 

Do I recommend this game? Sure
Do I think it's a bit over rated? Definitely

I'd give it a 7 out 10 for being a rhythm game that can't keep up with the real rhythm.

[b]REVIEW:[/b]
The pioneering VR music rhythm game is still going strong even with the negative reviews it's getting since losing the YouTube intergration. Adding your own music library is easy and it effectively gives you unlimited new levels to play. And the new fitness update is really good. 2 years on and it's still getting new features, so you got to appreciate the developers dedication.

If you want to enjoy some fine VR gaming and get a workout, look no further, Audioshield is a real test and a lot fun at the same time.

This game has the best replay value of any game that I've purchased for my HTC Vive.  It's.. just.. insanely addicting!!!

You can sync it to ANY song in your library or on YouTube.. meaning you can essentially play to any song in existence.

Difficulty levels can be too easy or too hard to have fun, but I've found the middle difficulty to be challenging enough to get me sweating without frustrating me by missing beats.

This is my absolute go-to game when I get off of work.  Just dance and pound the flying orbs and you lose track of everything except the music!

Pros:
Sync to ANY song on ur PC or Youtube
MOST songs Sync very well
It's a great workout!
Sound is great, visuals are good
Vibrations in the controllers are seamless

Cons:

Might need a decent ear for music to play at higher difficulties (A lot of songs send orbs on the up-beats and typically sync to the music, not the vocals)

Pros:
 - Totally smooth on geforce 1080. Looks good; generous particle effects.
 - When everything syncs up, VR beat dance is a great idea, and fun.
 - Pretty cool that it can import youtube videos, though it takes a while and seems to be only some subset of youtube.
Cons:
 - The automatic beat inference is bad. I tried a bunch of different music, including just some random tunes I like, electronic music that I thought would be ""easy for it"", and the globally most popular tracks (which I figured must be good?). There were certainly moments where I felt the sequence matched the song well, but they didn't last long. Like sometimes you'd get to a point in the song that was obviously symmetric to something you just did, but the dot sequence would just be different.
 - Menus and things seem pretty unpolished. ""Change location"" button just didn't do anything. Post-game report is like an ascii-formatted text file that shows up in a text box. There is no introduction for first-time players; it just throws you into the song browser.
 - Seems like they could easily provide more environments, but there are only three, so I got bored of those pretty fast.
 - It's hard to get perfect scores, but I didn't find the game all that challenging even at the highest level; there's not much negative feedback if you miss hitting dots and you can't ""fail"" a song like in Guitar Hero. I would like to see it directly challenge me some more. It also could use the up/down dimension more on difficult sequences. It's mostly punching back 
and forth at chest level.

This is a dead game to me and the fun exciting aspects of playing to your favorite songs are now frustrating and inaccessable as the only way to play to your own songs now is to upload mp3 files to the game which sucks as you have to get ahold of the mp3 files in the first place. additionally, you can no longer compete to your favorite songs as again they are now sourced from mp3 files on your computer instead of youtube videos. this means that even if you are playing the exact same song as someone else it will now show other people on the leaderboard since the files are technically different. Don't buy  this game. I'm so sorry to say that as this used to be my favorite game. If you want a more engaging option with more versatility beat saber is probably your best bet that I am aware of. 

Old review in case you would like to see my old opinions from around the beginning of this game:

If you are having second thoughts like I was about buying this game, don't.  I promise that you will not regret it.  The concept of this game may seem too short for $20, but trust me, it's not.  This is probably the most addicting VR game that I own because you can search youtube for literally any song or play one of the popular songs and try to get to the top of the leaderboard.
To sum this up (and make this review less tedious to read) here is a list of pros and cons with this game:

PROS:
-Super fun
-Infinite new songs to play
-Really good workout (there has actually been someone who has done a short study on how many calories you burn in vr games and this is one of those games that he did the study on.  Here is the link to the article that I found about it: https://uploadvr.com/best-htc-vive-games-excercise/     )
-Wide veriety of difficulties: Casual, Normal, Hard, Harder, and Elite for any level of challenged and sweaty you want to be
-You can rock out to the pokemon theme song along with my personal favorite, ""We Are Number One""
-The graphics and effects are really cool
-There are pvarious types of shields and environments to fit your liking
-You can search for a song from either in the game or from your computer with ease meaning if someone is trying it out you can set it up for them, or if you are alone and don't want to take your headset off to look at your computer you can just do a youtube search from inside the game
-You can comete against others and get creative with your movements to earn more points


CONS:
-You can't play for as long as you probably would like to; it gets really tiring and you get really sweaty after a while.
-As I said, this game can be really tiring if you are playing on a more intense difficulty.  If you hate moving this probably isn't for you, but even though it gets tiring it is so worth it and so fun
-The sweat. Preare to have waterfalls coming down your nose.  You might have to take off the headset to wipe your face between games if you are playing on a hard dificulty.

I've seen other people say that the notes aren't exactly in line with the song.  This is sortof true because it is auto-generated, so instead of the noted being in line with the lyrics I have noticed that they tend to be more in line with the actual notes, pitch, and volume.  This may sound bad if you havn't played the game, but this didn't really effect the expirience to me.  In fact, it sometimes even made the game more fun and made me feel more badass even thogh I deep down know that I probably look ridiculous in real life.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I 100% reccomend this game.  This is probably my favorite vr game, and that's going up against games like vanishing rhealms, the lab, rec room, the blu, and many others that I own and I've only had this game for a day or so! I Havn't found any problems that are too bad so far and I love, love, LOVE this game.

31184102,english,"The below review was written April 2017. YouTube support (probably my favorite feature) was dropped a while ago, so please see my comment below for some thoughts as of September 2019 (in short, I still recommend the game, though not quite as highly as I once did).

---------
Audioshield has overtaken our home.  For me and my roommates, this is the Vive killer app, and maybe it will be for you, too.

Let's get the few minor cons out of the way, first:
[list]
    [*]As others have noted, in some songs the orbs sometimes sync up poorly with the music, making such songs borderline unenjoyable (i.e., it seems more like a random pattern than any kind of rhythm).
    [*]I have not experienced this, but some players report that very rarely, the game does not correctly detect an orb being blocked (my roommate, obsessed with getting perfect scores, can attest to how frustrating this can be).
    [*]The menu interface still has some minor glitches, and certain functions are difficult to navigate to or occasionally decide not to work at all (this does not affect the gameplay at all, though, only the menus).
    [*]If you go to play a song on YouTube that has never been played before, the game must analyze the entire video before it is ready for you to play (though if someone else did play it at least once already, you can just start right away, which is the case with most popular songs).
[/list]

Okay, now on to the good stuff:
[list]
    [*]THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!  Find yourself some good songs where the orbs match up well (not that hard, I assure you; try some of the popular songs), crank up the difficulty, and jump in.  If you're a fan of rhythm games, you won't want to stop (seriously, as I write this I just finished a three-hour play session)!!
    [*]Being able to connect to YouTube is a great feature.  Pretty much any song you could possibly think of is there for you to try, so you don't technically even need your own library, and it's easy to get lost in all the possibilities.
    [*]The leaderboards! If you are even a little competitive, it can be a lot of fun challenging other people's scores.  And even if someone has a perfect score on a song, you can still ""dethrone"" them if you also get a perfect (though since it is possible to set up notifications when you get dethroned, don't think they won't try to take that top spot back).
    [*]Like DDR before it, you will accidentally be getting a workout just by playing a video game... so this is definitely one game you don't have to feel guilty about getting addicted to.
    [*]Like similar VR games (e.g. Space Pirate Trainer), this can be really fun to play locally with a group of friends taking turns (and guests can even put their own names in, to better keep track of scores).
    [*]Lastly, the developer seems to be actively updating the game (adding new features, arenas, and so on), so as far as I can tell this game has a hopeful future ahead of it.
[/list]

And finally some neutral notes (whether these are pros or cons depends on your perspective):
[list]
    [*]Each playthrough of a song will be slightly different.  While the exact timing and amount of orbs in a given song never change, the placement (and even orb color) can change from one playthrough to the next (though for those so inclined, there is supposedly a mod that changes this so every playthrough is identical).
    [*]The game scores you on both your technical ability (i.e., blocking every single orb), as well as your artistic ability (i.e., how much you move around to the music), and the technical score takes precendence on the leaderboards.  This means, for example, that someone with a perfect technical score of 10.00 but a terrible artistic score of 5.00 would still beat someone with an excellent technical score of 9.99 and a perfect artistic score of 10.00. A little unintuitive, I think, and good to be aware of if you want to top the leaderboards.
    [*]Finally, you need a compatible VR headseat with motion controllers (duh, but... just in case).
[/list]

In short, I highly recommend this game to anyone who owns a VR headset and is a fan of rhythm games or working out to music.  Recognize that you may find some duds, but the songs that work really well (and again, there are a lot of them) make it all worth it.

31077041,english,"This game is AWESOME! I purchased Audiosurf a few years ago, and liked the aspect of a music-based game using your own music instead of preinstalled or proprietary tracks. It was a cool idea, but not a game I could play for hours on a controller. When I heard the same company created the same idea, but on a VR platform. I couldn't contain my excitement. The game is beautifully put together, and it's incredibly easy to navigate the menus which can be done via your monitor and mouse or the HMD and controllers.

Allowing the usage of Youtube videos is a new feature that was not available in Audiosurf, but for those of you with weaker systems it should be known the youtube video plays in the background along with the orbs coming at your face which can easily put a strain on your GPU. If you've got an extensive library of popular songs though, you'll have no issue finding some competition on their leaderboards which will be visible to you before you launch your song. Once you complete a song, you can see how you compare with others globally, within your region (aka state in the US) or your Steam friends that also play. You can also add your email address which will notify you if you are ever bested in a song by another, and your position in the leaderboard shifts down.

Finally, there are a TON of people claiming the orbs do not sync in time with the song. That is crap. The orbs do sync in time with the song, but they won't always sync on the downbeat or on the part of a song which you would probably anticipate. The algorithm the game uses will often produce orbs on subdivisions of beats. If you are a musician or have any sense of rhythm outside 1-2-3-4, then you'll easily be able to feel the orbs syncing up with the tempo of the song. That being said, if you play something like Merzbow on Audioshield, the algorithm will most likely produce orbs that seem sporadic. The best music I've found to play on Audioshield are things like EDM, dubstep, trap, trance, even bass heavy pop songs. Post-hardcore & screamo music works well, too.

As stated, this game is awesome, but everyone should know before purchase that this IS AN ACTIVE GAME. You will be moving your arms around A LOT! Especially as you progress into the higher difficulties. If you are into your music like I am,  you will probably even find yourself stepping or jumping in time with the music also. You can easily wear yourself out by getting lost in the music. Remember to wear your controller straps, take breaks after every 1-3 songs and be sure to keep your HMD dry of sweat.",76561198000028698,116,66,1296,0,809,1557040597,1491913142,1491914831,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Obviously comparable to Audiosurf. It follows the music very well. A nice touch I always enjoy is that when the tempo kicks up, the angle of the orbs changes to start coming at you from further up.

I wish there was a difficulty between Normal and Harder. Normal just seems to have fewer orbs, which can kind of kill the mood for a song you really like when you aren't getting to hit on all the beats. The Harder difficulty, though it is much fuller, also throws in a lot of orb setups that require you to cross your arms. The jump in coordination required is huge.

I would like it if they could add more arena environments to play in, more shield shapes, and maybe a customization menu that allows you to set the color scheme of the orbs and shields.

I'd also like options that give you a more granular control over the gameplay, such as how often you're required to cross your arms, how wide the spread of orbs is, and maybe even an option to turn on a 360 degree approach of the orbs.

All criticisms aside, the feeling of playing this game is incredible. It sounds childish, but it just make you feel really cool. It feels like doing fight choreography set to music. It's just absolutely fantastic.

Pros:
- Song selection can be from a variety of sources including your PC and YouTube.
- Runs well.  My computer is on the lower end of what's acceptable for VR (i5-2500k @ 4.4GHz and GTX 970) and I don't really have any performance issues.
- It can be a good workout.  Playing a fast song on the hardest difficulty and going out of your way to 'punch' the orbs instead of just blocking them can work up a sweat.
- I was incredibly impressed when I tried to load a song that hadn't been previously played.  It played through the song once and then the level was ready to go.  Their algorithm for generating 'levels' is quite good.

Cons:
- Arenas are uninspired.  They're nothing special to look at and you don't usually notice them anyway.
- YouTube video playing in background is 100% unnecessary.  You never pay attention to the video, so in my case I'd rather have it not there taking up resources.

- I'm on a GTX 1070 and 3.12 Ghz quad core, but the game sort of fades out to the ""waiting for X game"" screen maybe once every 1-3 minutes for 1-2 seconds REGARDLESS of if I have the graphics turned to the absolute max or lowest.
- This is kind of a nitpick, but the hard difficulty makes you look left and right constantly, rather than just worrying about more complex note patterns. Seems cheap.

Wishlist
This game has big potential, but I want the world to be even more engaging, like maybe seeing distant mountains as waveforms pulsing in matching colors.
How about a song editor?
Harder difficulties should introduce more colors or maybe instruments. like clicking the button pad to change it the green. Or maybe notes fly into different quadrants of the screen almost like playing a rock kit.",76561197978968208,507,74,216,0,148,1522562309,1490579512,1490579512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a fan of Audiosurf and this one was on my radar before I purchased my VR headset as I read great reviews and kinda already knew I would like this game based on play style.

The game is simple enough, you have 2 sheilds (1 per hand) with different colours and need to punch the orbs that come down in time with the song's you play, the more you hit the higher your score (percentage). The reality for me however is about cranking up the difficulty to Elite, finding something fast and blasting full blast as I dance around like mad man trying for 100% so I can stare smuggly at the leader board on my fav songs :D 

I try to play this game for a minimum of 20 minutes a day and as stated at the top of my post I have lost 1 stone in around 5 weeks and I owe most of this to this game alone, I will warn however, purchase additional face cushions before pushing it.... things get rather wet.

Pros;
Simple 
Great workout game
Features such as youtube players are great
Online leader board
Multiple modes, levels and difficulties

Cons;
If this is not your thing, the game is very repetitive

Thanks largely to this game I have improved stamina, flexibilty, renewed my appreciation of various music genres, and acquired some dance moves beyond raptor arms.

I'm still fatter, older, and achier than I'd like, but I can occasionally escape to tron mode, where popping bubbles is all.


For prospective purchasers - anyone with at least two arms can enjoy this game at the lower levels, but the simpler algorithm can lead to a perceived lack of on-beat orbiness.

The 'harder' and 'elite' levels match up much better. At these levels only tracks using novelties like a sudden stop/start or reverse samples can become frustrating. Pretty much anything else with a defined beat will be fun. 

I prefer 'harder', which makes you swing your pants, and everything else, for the activity score. Elite provides activity points by upping the orbage and pattern diffuculty a bit, often becoming an all-arm twitch-fest. Different strokes, I guess. 


As far as improvements - of course we can hope for more of everything - modes/backgrounds etc., but it's a fantastic, well-balanced game as it stands, and I'd rather the dev put his time and experience into Audioshield 2, with a view to the capabilities of next-gen VR hardware.

I was looking for a VR game I could enjoy that would give me a workout, and this game is exactly that. It is from the developers of Audiosurf, and it shows. You can choose any song you have access to locally, from soundcloud, or from Youtube. It also appears that your ""friends favorites"" are from your Youtube friends, not people that have specifically purchased the game. 

The game itself is a simple premise. You choose a song, ball-things appear and you hit them with the correct color shield, blue on the left hand and ORANGE on the right (the game says red, but I see orange dammit). The ball-things have been on beat to the music on the songs I've played so far (from Youtube). There appears to be five levels of difficulty, but two (casual and legacy hard) are separated from the other three. I'm not sure what all changes with the different difficulties, but so far all of them have been a blast. There are also three different shield shapes, with one even being more a backhand shield (I kept having to force myself to hold the controller correctly, instead of cheating).

What I wasn't expecting though, was the scoring. There's a ""technical"" and ""artistic"" score. The artistic score seems to entail ""how into the music you are."" In other words, the more you bob, the stronger your punches (yes this measures punch strength when popping the ball-things), the higher the artisc score. The technical score is how many times you hit the ball-thing with the correct shield.

I haven't spent much time with this game yet, but I love rhythm games, and at this point I've seen what I need to see. This is well worth the $19.99.",76561197968613947,727,3,1392,0,706,1546240029,1487110638,1487110638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

29605946,english,"I liked the idea of Audioshield being able to load and play music from my own personal music library and be able to punch/block the beat. Im a big fan of DDR, Guitaro Hero, Stepmania, Cytus, Dance Central, Fantasia, and other such music games that bring my enjoyment of the songs to a new level. These kinds of games make the music feel more alive, it makes you feel part of it. So when I first heard of audioshield I knew right away I would be buying it, and It could potentially go beyond and be better than any music game ever. 

Sad to say, all of the games I mentioned are far better than audioshield. And what do they have that audioshield doesnt? On point beats/rythm. I am not a expert musician or game designer, but you dont have to be in order to realize that the red/blue/purple beats coming at your face is not at all lined up with the songs (at least the majority of the time).

When you play other rythm games it makes you kinda dance or put your energy into the beats, it almost energizes you. A good song makes the game funner, and a good stage/level makes the song better. With audioshield though, it makes both feel worse. As I was playing the game I tried to make the color blasts match, I would try punching the blasts with my shield but that doesnt match, and many colors are long rifts which also doesnt match like it should. Then I try just blocking the blasts, which probably is the easiest way to go if you want to be accurate with the game, but this way is even less fun/engaging and it completely changes the game from a music beat type of game, to some bland, bargain bin, color matching game, the music just becomes backround noise if you play it this way.

Long story short, I decided after about 10 different songs that this game sucks, its in a way broken, because it doesnt do what it sets out to do. It shouldnt be called audio shield, it should just be called Music Visualizer VR. And one other thing I must mention.

It's a great concept, and I love how it's a form of DDR for VR and instead of your legs you use your hands.  I love how it gets you moving about your room trying to hit all the beats and after a couple songs I'm actually breathing pretty good with a good sweat going!  It's a lot of fun with moderate re-play value and makes for a staple party game.

Now for the bad....  The games audio sync is really not that great.  Half the time I feel like the game has just synced to random noises in the song and are not to the beat at all.  The moves feel un-natural, not to the time of the music.  Because of it, it is very difficult to keep up with the moves because they don't match the natural time of the music.  It feels this way for most songs, I've only found a handful that are perfectly timed, poppy and fun.

It's very interruptive as well having to wait to start or wait to end, pick a new song takes time and a lot of songs the timing is lagged.  It looks like the song synced well but the beats stutter...  Freeze up and then suddenly come flying at you.  Nothing is ever at a consistent speed and it's hard to keep on top of, again, detracting from the experience.

29065832,english,"Update: After many hours sunk into this game, I can no longer give it a positive review. The main issue I mentioned below (bad tracking causing missed notes) is infuriating at upper levels of this game. I've played Sound Boxing quite a bit now as well and it doesn't suffer from this problem, which leads me to believe it's not a problem with the Vive hardware.

First off, the scoring system is horrible. The game scores you based on accuracy and 'style', both on a 0-10 scale. Accuracy is the main attribute that will determine where you rank on a leaderboard, and if you're tied for accuracy then it will come down to how the game judges your 'style'. Trying to get/maintain a high score is a very frustrating process when the game fails to track the controllers and it mostly turns into a matter of luck.

Second, the 'style' is not actually a 0-10 scale as the game would lead you to believe. It's possible to get above a 10, although you have no way to actually tell what the true value is. Trying to beat a high score that is some unknown amount higher than yours is a frustrating process.

I really like the concept behind this game, and love the ability to generate a level based on any song you choose (unlike Sound Boxing, which people have to create levels on). I still get one hell of a workout when I get into it, but trying to get a high score isn't fun.

Old review:

Audioshield is hands-down my favorite game (so far) on the Vive. I was always a sucker for rhythm games and this is tickling that itch while also being a productive workout tool. I actually bought a Fitbit to track heartrate because I was curious how well this was working, and this easily gets me above 100 BPM and up to 150 on some songs (e.g. metal).

I have two complaints with the game, though it's nothing I can't work around:

-If you're punching notes too fast, it's possible to miss. I imagine this is due to controller tracking, but it can be annoying if you care about getting that 100%
-The game does not handle long tracks very well. By long, I'm talking about one hour or more. Since I'm using this as a workout tool, this is not a crazy scenario for me and I've had to resort to using YouTube videos because local files will just never finish processing. Even YouTube tracks of this length take like 15-20 minutes to load, albeit only the first time. I love using this to workout, but having to change tracks constantly definitely takes away from the experience.

It’s a simple concept: punch the floating glowing orbs in time with the music. That’s it. You could literally print the rules on a match book. You might even be thinking, “Sounds just like every other music rhythm game made for the last ten years.” Well, while Audioshield might share it’s gaming DNA with Guitar Hero, this is a prime example of how a well-executed VR experience can transform an otherwise worn out formula into something incredible.
 
In Audioshield, you are transported to an immense stage with a giant screen playing your music video off in the distance. Waves of orbs fly toward you in time with the beat and you block them with the glowing shields that cover your hands. It adds a sense of urgency to the music while being relaxing at the same time. When things go right and you hit a several orbs perfectly, there is a definite connection with the music and that spark will put a smile on your face. At the end of the song, a global ranking pops up. (A humbling but motivating experience in my uncoordinated case.)

Pros:  
Very replay-able since any music can be used from your own library or online.

Simple and intuitive mechanics. Anyone can play. Makes it a great group game.

Cons:
Could use a couple more theaters. While the three currently included with the game are great, a few more would be welcome.

You have a blue shield in your left hand and an orange shield in your right. You choose a song to play to, which can be a suggested song or one from your music library (same as Audiosurf).

As you play, projectiles are fired towards you; these are either blue, orange or purple in colour. As they reach you, you 'block' with the corresponding colour shield. Purple shots are blocked by holding both shields close or pulling both hand controller triggers (on HTC Vive).

At the end of the song you're rated based on how many shots you blocked but also how artistic you were and how much energy you expend. Basically, play enthusiasticly, move around a lot and you'll get a better score provided you still manage to block shots well.

The difficulty curve is well done; the lowest difficulty is extremely easy, but high BPM songs in higher difficulties can be a huge workout.

28799789,english,"So I've logged way too many hours with this game. In my opinion, it's worth a buy both as a fun diversion (who doesn't love punching music in the face?) and an actual fitness tool.

First, the biggest complaint I see people making when they first try the game (and a claim often made in refunds) is that the rhythm at which the blue and orange balls come in doesn't match the song. That's actually true only if you try to ""catch"" the balls - which is not how you're supposed to play. You don't catch the notes in Audioshield - you punch them!

Although it's not obvious, the beat track is generated such that it expects you to be punching the note with an extended arm from a standing position, not ""catching it"" a second later. That's why the beat track may seem off if you try to intercept the notes at your chest, rather than punching the note while it approaches. Once you figure *that* out, and you start to time your left/right punches with the beat, all of the sudden the game stops being a diversion and becomes an actual zenlike trance. Your punches match the beat and you start having a really good time.

Obviously, as with other rhythm games, the difficulty level you choose will affect how many beats get thrown at you at once. If you start out on the lowest difficulty, this also lends to the feeling that the beat tracks aren't completely synced, as it purposely drops notes so as not to overwhelm you. Once you're ready to tackle Elite difficulty (which I believe is the most fun) you're getting tracks that match your chosen song beat for beat, and give you a good workout besides.

As far as fitness goes, what makes Audioshield so good is that, once you start punching all the beats as they fly toward you, you start burning calories like nobody's business. Granted, a Fitbit is not a precise tool, but there's been times when I've burned 600 calories in maybe 50 minutes of play. Obviously, YMMV depending on whether you're punching fast or slow songs, and your difficulty level, but the biggest benefit of Audioshield is it keeps me entertained while I work out.

I've tried exercise bikes, treadmills, and other devices for cardio while watching TV, and I get bored quickly. But I can easily punch music in Audioshield for an hour and the time flies by. Honestly, sometimes I have to make myself stop.

As far as music, anything works, whether local files or right off Youtube. I have a ton of MP3s and prefer those, but I do stream songs off Youtube on occasion without issue. Finally, while Elite difficulty will make any song at least a bit challenging, there are certainly songs that are more fun than others (seriously, play just about anything by Blue Man Group and you'll have a good time). Anything with a strong beat is ideal, as the beat track comes off drums/percussion.

In summary, I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy listening to music, rhythm games, punching music, or who just want a fun way to burn some calories while punching along to their favorite songs.

Remember! Punch the notes, don't catch them.",76561197988955334,93,6,3866,0,2344,1622685373,1483036336,1483036352,True,1,0,0.502233564853668213,0,True,False,False
28794661,english,"I hardly recommend this game. The general gameplay idea is fine, but there are some issues:

- This game lacks features. It's one minigame sold for an high price. You're paying an HUGE VR premium. There are no hand made tracks, menus are as minimal as possible (looking for a specific track is hell, expecially on YouTube), there's a lack of costumization in the challenge and a lack of different ""hazards"" (boosting the difficulty just adds more spheres overall, there are no added challenges like spheres to avoid or to never touch);
- Hard mode is cheap: most of the times I miss spheres just because they appear out of sight.
- This is the most common complaint: the spheres basically NEVER follow the rhythm. The game rewards you for catching the spheres with strength, which is fine, but since they never seem to follow the song, most of the time you find yourself just parrying them because hitting them is pure luck.
- To add to the last complaint, the spheres change speed on the fly which, together with the ""the song and the spheres are not on the same rhythm"" complaint, forces the player to passively parry the spheres, which kinda defeats the purpose of a music game.

The music selection is basically YouTube videos or your personal library, so you can search for any song you like and get your groove on.  Unfortunately they don't have a history/favorite video function so anytime you want to play a new video you'll have to manual search for it.  Another drawback is there's usually a bit of lag just at the intro to a song that causes several of the orbs to ""spawn"" on top of you so that you miss them, messing up your score, not that score is that important anyway, but it CAN motivate you to shake your ass harder to get to the top spot on a specific song.

GAMEPLAY: Sometimes you want to go Dubstep and play some Zedd, others times you may feel poprock like the killers, or even play some soundtacks to your favorite Shows or movies (i've done everything from Buffy the V slayer to repo the gentic opera). ""Be a man"" by mulan never gets old or getting shwifty with old man rick. If its on youtube or your library, you can play the song! 9.5/10

CONTROLS: very intuitive and simple. blue sheild in one had, red in the other. Combine them to make a purple sheild.
Now get ready for balls to rain down from the heavens as you fight them off (in color coordinated fasion). 
While the controls and concept of the game is simple, it still offers a great challenge with the patterns and song choice (higher BPM's and complex rhythms step the game up).

Sound: Havent had a problem with sound so far. Depends on the quality of video or audio file. i have stock headphones that came with a vive bundle and thats enough to hear everything and then some. 10/10

There's no campaign. This is a game to just have fun and let loose. Sometimes before a jog, i'll punch all the balls in a boxers stance as  a warm up on high BPM songs. So much fun as long as you always have a new song in mind!

Cons:
- Performance is choppy at times for me, even when I dial back the graphics on my 1070. This is a game where frame drops are devastating.
- Loading times are quite long, and sometimes I wait for ages and find hitting a button magically makes everything load up. Seems to be a bug.

- The ability to see your past scores on each song, perhaps in graph form.
- Autopause when the dashboard is triggered accidently (I'm clumsy).

Two years on the developer is still updating the game. Kudos!

 - vibration feedback
 - play song from YouTube
 - really great VR experince
 - if you love music/rythem games this is the ultimate form you can ever experience in

 - [Edit on April/09/2017: developer had updates on this point!]song searching on main UI can improve a bit: a bit hard to put in search strings every time
 - [Edit on April/09/2017: faverate mode has been added!! ] maybe have a ""favorite"" or ""add to library"" function after found a song or a list
 - more environment would be great
 - resolution is too low. and somehow I couldn't find much difference of 640x480 and 1680x800
 - rift please?
 - [Edit on April/09/2017: Despite it's not officially stated in the game's Steam status, but I can actually launch this game in Oculus Rift now like a lot of other Vive games with the latest SteamVR SDK - just remember to do a ""setup the room"" procedure in SteamVR as well after you setup your Rift in Oculus Home, otherwise the positioning might be off] Vive's display is just so pixelated - sorry not related to the game i just had to rant :)

And its a reall good concept, but sadly the game itself is pretty .. ""meh"". The idea is 10/10, the graph and other stuffs are a solid  8/10, but the algorithm for the youtube songs is preatty bad, like 3/10 bad (there is some song that actually not bad, but most of the time its just nonsens randomness. By the way i mostly use it for rock/metal so its maybe better on pop/electro). I have programming experience, so I know its hard to write a good algorithm that you can use on every youtube vid, but still it could be a LOT better than this.

Well thats my big concerne, but there are a lot of small things that could be better:

-The shileds hitbox is not 100%. I have an older PC so i only have 45 fps at best so maybe thats the reason, but sometimes the sound blobs just pass through my shield. (like 1% of the time)

-The blobs come way to high. I noticed that the higher the sound the higher the blubs, but it just constant high. It need to start lower, and incrase less for the sound. I cant do more than 1-2 song at the time because my neck start to hurt. Its like watching an IMAX movie from the first line.

-If you start the youtube video instantly after loading in to the ""chamber"" the first 1-2 sec is totally fucked up. So you need to wait like 10 sec every time after loading before you actually can start.

-custom shields and maps would be nice.

-A little less cross boxing would be nice. I play on hard and expert (or whatever its called) and there is a lot of time when you have to box x-cross with your hands. Its not really a good way to incrase difficulty. Give us more and faster blobs, but not this crossboxing thing.


I hope they gonna do something with the algorithm. If they do i would never stopp playing it.

- Patterns are generated, so I can play some niche music. I like to explore different tracks more than focusing to perfect a few.
- Balls are well spread out in ""harder"" mode, but it's still usual to get perfect hit success. So while I need to focus, I can play with an ""aggressive style"" (ample and fast punch on each bubble) to get a good artistic score. Not the most efficient way to do that, but that's how I achieve my best feelings of power and merging with the music.
- ""Elite"" mode is great if I want a technical challenge. Rarely a perfect hit score (close though), but now I mostly play that anyway.

Some points that would need improvement in my view:
- I don't like pauses in the flow, and sometimes generated patterns are not so good. Though current modes cannot be tweaked without messing up the score rankings.
- Maybe for a new mode/game, instead of ""artistic"" score I'd like one that promote punch power on each bubble. Not just impact speed, but also requiring an ample movement.
- File exploration could be improved, to also list a few information about the track. For example my best score in selected mode.

26709534,english,"So, this game is pretty much exactly what it looks like.

PROS:
-Very fun! That's pretty dang important for a game.
-Lets you listen to any song you want!
-Works well, didn't encounter too many bugs, if any.
-A nice physical activity game that doesn't involve TOO much physical activity. You keep active, but it's not as exhausting as something like Dance Dance Revolution (unless of course you play the hard modes in which case you're a maniac). I like to start my day with it from time to time to wake me up and get the blood flowing.
-Good game that you can just hop into, play for a few minutes, then hop out if you want. Which also makes it good for showing it to friends.

CONS:
-I'm not sure why but the sprites in this game (The orbs, if you will) are blurry.
-If you play a song from the internet who's file you don't already have on your computer, and nobody's ever played it before, the game will take a while (as long as the duration of the song, to be percise) to ""Create"" the level for it.
-The computer generated levels are usually pretty good, but they are random and are based on the computer's understanding of what the song is like. This leaves me sorely wanting a level editor, so that people can make levels based on actual choreography or the flow of the song, rather than just procedurally generated beats and long notes.
Plus it would help minimize the time when notes sneak on you by hiding behidn other notes, or by showing up on the opposite edge of the play area than where you're facing.
-No ability to see how well you did previous times on a level.
-It seems fairly easy to get a score above 9 on normal mode, regardless of how good you are. The actual difference is usually in the numbers after the decimal point.
-I wanted to record this game for a Youtube video but the desktop display of it is portrait oriented, rather than landscape for some reason. Not easy to record.

Final verdict: Fun. Simple. Needs more features in my opinion, but worth buying if it's on sale or if you're really into this sort of game.",76561198000574574,255,46,1216,0,624,1524535303,1479636206,1479636252,True,10,1,0.610427498817443848,0,True,False,False
26704647,english,"I've been a huge fan of Audiosurf since I got my hands on the first one, the idea of a dynamic rhythm game in which you can load your own audio files has always captivated me. Audioshield is no exception.

Though most will have you believe that the Youtube update killed the game, that's not the case. Though admittedly it did negatively impact it, as I've not even been able to get that part of the game to work, and I definitely miss the days when I could just play something from Soundcloud, it made it a ton easier for those of us in the underground EDM scene, where tracks we like aren't always on Youtube.

However, the game still gives you just as much freedom with the ability to load in your own files. If you're a fan of Audiosurf 1 or 2, you'll be familiar with this system, as the interface is identical to Audiosurf 2 (same dev). I'm not sure how much the the algorithm has changed, but I can say it feel very fluid and accurate. Though some songs with a lot of complicated rhythms can be a bit difficult to play, it's still very fun. Me and my family have spent countless hours playing this, laughing at each other's and our own mistakes in the game and trying to beat each other's scores. The game also offers to change who is playing on the PC side, allowing for guests to keep separate scores than the owner of the account. It's very active, and even encourages players to be more so with the ""Physical Activity"" score.

Conclusion:
If you're looking for a good rhythm game for the Vive, this is about the best there could be (excluding the bad Youtube implementation and removal of Soundcloud). A must have if you love music and own a Vive.

Otherwise, a worthy addition to my VR library offering something more unique, and with the ability to import songs I know this screams replayability.,",76561197991698116,135,13,500,0,235,1585159050,1478809754,1478809754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

　　游戏当中的音乐玩家可以自行下载，支持MP3、Flac，不支持ape格式，任何符合格式要求的音频都可以（甚至包括郭德纲相声、新闻联播等等）。并且最后会给与歌曲以及玩家的游戏表现一个详细评分。音质根据玩家下载的版本而定。
　　游戏的玩法和操作都很简单。玩家可以自行选择已经下载的游戏歌曲进行游戏。
　　进入正式游戏前，总共要进行三项设置，盾牌形状、游戏难度、游戏场景。
　　游戏分为Normal、Hard、Harder三种难度，玩家可以根据自己的需求选择。但是Normal与Hard模式下，难度区分并不是太大，只有在Harder模式下才能明显感觉到与前两种模式的区别。
　　玩家手中的手柄将化身为盾牌，通常是左手蓝色盾牌，右手橙色盾牌，盾牌对应打击同色光球，紫色光球则需要玩家两只手一起抵挡或者直接按住手柄上的按键。
　　有两种方式可以选择还是很人性化的，不至于让玩家因为操作的问题而错过紫色光球。
　　该游戏结合了VR的体感模式，不仅让音乐实现可视化，还玩出了打击感。在画面上虽然不尽如人意，但是带给玩家的视觉冲击力很强，让玩家在游戏中感受一场视觉盛宴。
　　游戏目前在Steam上售价为68元人民币，这个价格已经偏高了，并且游戏中玩家想要更多曲子来进行挑战，就必须花钱购买，造成游戏成本增加。
　　总的来说，这个游戏可玩性比较高，但性价比偏低，适合资金比较充足的玩家。

Man, what a joke. Thanks, Google for ruining a really good VR game because your selfish BS got in the way of letting people have fun. Remind me to never buy a Google product again, oh wait, you just did.


----OLD REVIEW---\/

9.3/10 - In my opinion the best VR game available for the Vive.

PROS:
The replay value of this game is very very high (which is very very rare among VR games nowadays). You can try new songs over and over by picking from your audio/video collection on your hard drives, or you can even search for a YouTube video and play it. Every time you play the same song, the same orbs will come in the exact same pattern, so you can play songs until you master them, or just pick new songs every time. 

The competitive online aspect of this game is also very high, as any popular song has a leaderboard. The leaderboard is different whether it comes from your hard drive or from YouTube, but there is a leaderboard to compete against on any popular song either way. I even found that some of my favorite songs by relatively unpopular artists (by bands like Opeth, or Infected Mushroom) had one or two people to compete agains on the leaderboards.

Out of all the games I've played for VR since I got my Vive a couple of weeks ago, this one seems to give you the most exercise WITHOUT the chance of hitting objects in your real life space, or tangling/unplugging a cord in the process.

I was skeptical of this game before I purchased it that the orbs wouldn't be in sync enough with the music to enjoy it. I was very wrong. They obviously have a pretty advanced algorithm for making the gameplay match certain notes in the song. The harder the difficulty you choose, the more the orbs go to the song. Of course on easy mode its hard to see how the notes are going to the song, but thats beacause easy mode is there to teach you, not to make you feel like you're part of the song.

And the best part about this game is, even when you master a song, and can hit 100% of the notes, you get an 'Artistic' score. I have found that this is based on how you are moving in correlation to the rhythm of the song. When I am jumping around and dancing to the song while blocking the orbs, I get a much higher artistic score than if I were just standing there carefully blocking the orbs as they come.


CONS:

The feeling of personal achievement and progression is very limited with this game. You can compare yourself to other players that just so happened to play the same song from the same source (HDD mp3 ID tag/YouTube), but it ends there. There is no 'campaign' type system in place that you have to beat in order to progress.

There are no tiers to see how well you scored (like all the good rythym games have in place). A star system (1-5) stars would make this game more endearing, but unfortunately it just has a score for your % of notes hit, and a modifier for Artistic value (If i hit 100% of the notes I get a 10.0, and can only surpass other 10s on the leaderboard by having a higher artistic value)

There seems to be a bug with some songs that make it almost impossible to hit all the notes at the start because of a bpm change that somehow basically superspeed rush a bunch of notes at you so fast that its impossible to block them. It seems like a bug and I'm sure it will be fixed eventually. 


----------

What I think should be added to this game: 

* A campaign mode that the devs made with songs they chose, where you can actually fail a song if you miss too many notes too fast (like GH/RB), and cant continue to the next few songs until you pass 2/3 or 3/4 of the songs in that tier. 

* A campaign builder mode where you can make your own setlist (with only YouTube songs, to make it easier to program) and upload it that follows the same rules as the devs campaign; you have to beat the songs in order and not fail, in order to unlock the next songs in the setlist. 

* A list of recently played songs (24 hours?) by every Audioshield user. This would encourage people to try out and be expsed to new songs that people have already played, so they're guaranteed to have at least one person to compete against.

* A star power type system that you can get by hitting difficult note streaks that either makes your shields bigger or makes both shields able to block either color note for a short period of time. 

* User imported arenas/Arena Builder mode

[*]Great Immersion, you get to ""feel"" your favorite songs.

[*]Overall graphics are clean, and looks nice. Very Tron-esque.
[*]I didn't have any problems with stability, kept a buttery smooth 90fps during gameplay. I did get some dropped frames when I started tweaking supersampling, but that isn't a fault of the game.
[*]It's a damn good workout.

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]In the grey area between a roomscale and standing experience. Not knocking the game at all here, works fine as is.
[*]Beats are generated based on an algorithm, the game scans the audio file and generates orbs accordingly. While ususally this works pretty well, there is some definite room for improvement. Understandably a lot of songs don't match up well on base difficulty. Faster paced songs having orbs matched to every beat could easily overwhelm new players on lower difficulty. That being said, some songs even on harder difficulty don't match up like you would hope. The option to play hand keyed music would be great.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Huge lack of quality songs from the default online resource (Soundcloud). You will run into a lot of bad remixes of songs you actual want to play. If you have a well stocked Google Play Music account I would highly recommend [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4tbso3/use_audioshield_with_google_play_music_v30/] the Audioshield-PlayMusic mod. [/url] It's a proxy server mod that replaces Soundcloud support with Play Music support. This game would really flourish with support for Spotify, and Play Music out of the box.
[*]Song selection interface is poop.
[*]No way to see song length from menu. Would be very nice to know before you start an epic 10 minute+ song. This can be very exhausting on hard/harder difficulties.
[*]No Workshop support. Game only has 2 stages, and they get very old. Also handkeyed music would be a godsend, as mentioned in the neutral section.
[*]Searching for songs in-game is a chore, though this is more the fault of the steam virtual keyboard than the game itself. You're going to want to lauch the game and make a playlist at your computer, As opposed to searching for music a song at a time in-game.
[*]This seems to have gotten better with recent patches, but long songs can take a significant time to load.

The price is acceptable ONLY because the VR game  market is so thin, and filled with so many pitfalls, that this game stands out as somewhat quality in comparison.  That's not really a vote in the plus column for this game as it is a sigh of disappoint for the current state of VR as of writing this review, but there it is...

In my opinion, Audioshield is more striking just above what I'd consier a minimum bar of quality.  A more fair price point for this game, based on it's mechanics and level of depth, would be about $5.  If this game wasn't VR, and was a trypical ""flat"" game, you'd probably be some free bowser based game with a lot more depth.  Just looking at the game from a mechanic standpoint, you will find it has trouble syncing with a lot of songs, and it's missing some cool obvious features such as letting users create their own modified song syncs to share with friends, etc. 

The graphics are ""ok"", not great, definatley not polished like The Lab.  There are only two scenes to listen / interact music with, when there could easily be more.  There's no kind of actual progression, no co-op, it's really just a bare bones experince.  In my time with the game, it also crahed often, sometimes forcing me to restart SteamVR.  

Still, given the rough state of many VR titles, I'm going to thumb this game up.  With all the negatives above, it is still immersive and fun.  When you load up one your personal favorite music scores, and you get into that virutal world that doens't seem at all that interesting in flat videos on the store poge, you'll find a TOTALLY different world and expereince in VR.  Then kicks in the highs and lows of yoru favorite song, and honestly, you could be in for a surprisingly  emotional experience.  It's prtobably just the music of your favorite track thundering in the background  ...but either way, it's about that time you might think this game was maybe actually worth the $20.  

It's also worth mentionging this is the kind of game tha draws in non-gamers, such as your mother in-law, etc.  Just load up their favroite song, and watch them be wow'd to the immersion of VR.  The clear excersize / activity you have to extert playing the game is also a fairly good ground for buying it, just for health.

+Simple and addicting
+SoundCloud integration
+Good way to get up and moving while gaming
+Music gameplay algorithm is not perfect, but works well enough (harder difficulties and certain songs are better than others)
+Graphics are sharp and do a good job making you feel epic

CONS:
-Developer updates with new features are non-existent (needs playlist feature, other music services, etc.)
-Could use workshop integration (only 2 stages, but you can find some minor mods online)

One of the things you can’t appreciate from the video is how cool it looks to have the coloured balls coming at you and how awesome it feels to pop them and get in a flow. Really easy to play, only takes 2 or 3 goes to really get in to it and then it becomes one of the best VR arcade style games out at the moment.

24546925,english,"I love the concept of Audio shield. I think it is ambitious, and has great potential. Before buying my vive, I greatly anticipated playing this title. It was one of my first purchases of vive software. My reference point is that of a musician. I'm a professional violinist, orchestra director and educator. Music is my life, and what I do for a living. 

I quickly have become disilutioned with this title, for one main reason. I feel that the ""punches and pulses"" should be curated for the best rhythm punching experience possible, but they are not. From what I have read and experienced by playing, the punching of beats is generated randomly. 

This makes for an often very bizzarre experience, that does not line up with the music very well.  

I wish the developers of Audioshield would add a method for the community to custom make punches (Like the Bethesda community), or have the developers create a library of curated songs, the game is just not worth spending time with. 

To recap:

The pros:
Great concept (if it worked)
Awesome visual effects
Cool left and right shields, feel great and look awesome

The cons:
-Most or all of the music is OUT OFSYNC with the beat puching
-Punching is generated randomly
-There is not currently a way for the community to create custom beat puches and movements

24498951,japanese,"音楽に合わせてこちらへ向かってくる、赤青の球を、左右のViveコントローラ上に作られる盾で弾くVR音ゲー。
作者はSteamでは有名な音ゲーであるAudiosurfの人。
http://store.steampowered.com/app/235800/
ステージは手持ちの音楽の他、同じSteamの音ゲーのAudiosurf2のSong of the dayや、よくプレイされてる曲が連携されているので、それらを選択することで自動生成される。
またフリーワード検索ではSoundCroudに対する検索も行ってくれるため、SoundCroudの曲もプレイが可能。
曲の選択画面はマルチバイト文字に対応しており、よくある日本語名タイトルの曲が文字化けしてよく分からないということも無い。

盾の形状やプレイ時の背景（空間）を選択することができ、Audiosurfと同様にスコアボードにも対応している。
また、ステージの難易度はNormal、Hard、Harderの3種類から選択ができる。
Audiosurf2のようなワークショップ対応は残念ながら今のところ無い。

ゲーム内容は上記に書いたとおり弾くだけだが、盾で球を弾いた時のエフェクトと、コントローラーの振動が凄く気持ちよく、つい長時間プレイしてしまう。
振動の感覚としては、水をプラスチックの板で弾いてる時の感覚に近い気がする。プルプル感がたまらない。
そして何より気持ち良いのは、既存のAudiosurfシリーズより、譜面の配置がより音楽のリズムに合っている。
もうノリノリでパンチを繰り出せるわけである。

スコアの採点方法は、球を弾いた数と、どれだけ芸術的に弾けたかの芸術点の2つでの採点方法になっている。
後者の芸術点は正直満点の取り方が分からない。
盾で弾くときのパンチの速度が1つの採点対象となっているようだが、それ以外は不明。
満点とってる人のプレイ動画を是非見てみたい。

Viveを持っている人で音ゲーが好きな人、Audiosurfのプレイヤーに是非プレイしてほしい一品。

24386108,english,"Pros:
-Very active (A high 'Artistic' score is acheived through a lot of active movement).
-When songs sync very well, it is a VERY satisfying experience.
-The game looks very nice.

Mixed:
- The ""Audiosurf Analysis System"" is very hit or miss. Songs with hard hitting notes that are defined, with percussion that is clear works the best. Music that has a lot of background noise (i.e. Classic Rock) doesn't work as well, and the notes will seem more random. The algorythm could be better in that sense. However, when the system works, with the whole song having the orbs on point, it is very, very fun.


Cons:
-No streaming services (what was the best part about the game)


Overall I find the game very enjoyable, and I can forgive that the orbs aren't always 100% accurate to the notes, but it is good enough for me. Moments when songs are intence and the orbs line up perfectly are very satisfying, and I always work myself into a sweat trying to get a high artistic score.

What really swung it was the moment I bothered to transfer my music collection over to the computer with the HTC Vive on it. Fending off incoming music blobs to your favourite tunes is so very more-ish.

That said, I would like to point out that somewhere between the first and second times I played Audioshield, the leaderboards and global music menu stopped working. So when I tried it that first time I could pick from a selection of songs that other Audioshield users had ""battled"" their way through, when I came back I couldn't get to that menu and basically had to select songs from my computer's hard drive instead. Of course, since these aren't known to Audioshield, you can never compare your performance against anyone else. (So all the leaderboards stay completely blank.)

If one of the devs reads this and can suggest what might have gone wrong and how I can get back the global menu / leaderboard, I'd really appreciate it. (Not that I think I'm any good at Audioshield, but it would be fun to see how my performances compare with others around the world...)

- Some reviews complain about the notes not being in sync to when you hit them... all you have to do to fix this is take a step forward or backwards, as appropriate, since it is a spacial game so your positioning can affect timing (there are food pads on the floor that you're supposed to stand on, but depending on arm length and when you naturally feel like you should be hitting the notes the timing can be adjusted by you physically moving in the room).

- I like that there are leaderboards for each song, and that you also get points not just for having perfect accuracy but also for just being active and moving around, it keeps things interesting.

- I would like to see integration of various web-based music services like amazon prime and google play music, although you can also just download these to your computer and select them that way.

The game simply randomly generates new tracks each and everytime (While they still stay close to the previous track of the same song I have noticed) and it will follow the melody of the song. The slower or softer the song, the less ""FAK"" you will go, HOWEVER this also factors on the difficulty. Cause you have Normal (easy), Hard ( Normal) and Harder (Hard). Hard (Normal) is recommended for a good time.

23970490,french,"Un jeu qui avait l'air franchement symphatique au premier abord, surtout vu les retours positifs... mais non, avec moi ça ne passe pas. 
Je m'ennuie ferme sur ce jeu. Même les modes de difficultés les plus élevés ne parviennent pas à m'amuser. Ce n'est pas que le jeu soit particulièrement facile, j'ai loupé quelques boules (quoique pas sufissamment pour avoir commencé direct en difficulté max), mais je ne ressent rien en jouant. Moi qui aime les jeux de jeux de rythme, je suis souvent emporté par la musique, avec un vrai sentiment d'accomplissement quand je suis bien le rythme, mais là bah rien.
La faute surement à deux ou trois choses :

Le rythme n'est pas clair ou pas rescpecté, l'impact des boules sur le bouclier ne se fait pas toujours en rythme, mais avec les contrôleurs du vive, ce n'est peut-être pas si étonnant. Ce genre de jeu demandant un certain timing précis, tout dépends dès lors de l'endroit où la boule s'écrase. Selon si on l'arrête à bout de bras ou au plus près du corps, le timing ne sera pas le même. Le seul moyen d'avoir un rythme parfait serait de ne pas bouger et de garder les contrôleurs toujours à la même distance. Mais alors dans un cas, ça ferait très mal aux bras rapidement, et dans l'autre ce serait tout simplement inintéressant.

Le second point, c'est que les vibrations des controlleurs ne sont pas assez puissantes. Ce n'est pas la faute du jeu j'imagine, mais j'aimerais sentir d'avantage l'impact des boules sur les boucliers.

Et le troisième, c'est que la musique n'a pas de ""sur ou sous notes"". J'entends par là que l'on entends pas les notes qui sont réussies, ce qui m'empêche de ""sentir"" la musique.

Ah puis une autre défaut assez rédhibitoire, c'est que les boules arrivent trop souvent en hauteur, ce qui fait que l'on passe le plus clair de son temps à lever la tête, et le cou finit vite par en souffrir, notamment à cause du poids du casque, qui, s'il n'est pas significatif en conditions d'utilisation normale, se fait sentir quand on doit lever les yeux au ciel en permanence. Ajoutez à cela le poids d'un casque audio, ça devient vite désagréable.

Bref, l'idée de base du jeu est honorable, mais je pense honnetêment que ce genre n'est pas adapté à la VR, en tout cas pas de cette façon. A la limite si on jouait une batterie virtuelle façon Rock Band, ça marcherait, les caissons seraient fixes, donc pas de dé-syncrhonisation espace-rythme.

23761621,english,"It's ok... but it uses the same algorithm as audiosurf, which is very hit or miss as to how well it synchronises with a given track - I'm a Symphonic Power Metalhead, and I found that some tracks such as Sober by Voyager (fucking awesome track by a fucking awesome band!) synchronised reasonably well and felt satisfying to play, but others like Vampire by Xandria just had no feeling of the music at all and the game actually detracted from the music.

One annoying thing I found trying to play Metal tracks was that the intensity of the music almost always made the game spawn orbs from their maximum height, which just led to me craning my head to look towards heaven and my neck getting sore - and not the good kind of sore from headbanging, which is rather impossible to do in this game.

I'd also criticise that the orb positioning, which also has no (apparent) link to the music and seemed quite random. The game also had an annoying tendancy to do a sweep with one arm, followed immediately by another orb of that same colour/arm over the other side, which you often can't see in time because the orbs in the sweeping movement block the view of it. For that matter, I'd like an option to turn off the colours - I just want to enjoy my music and not really care about which arm I'm supposed to use for which orb.

To be honest, if you just want to hang out in VR and dance to your favourite music just load up a custom environment in SteamVR and use the light saber models to replace the controllers - this kept me entertained for hours the other night :-p

If you want a good VR rhythm game I'd recommend checking out Holodance as well as (or instead of) this one - it doesn't allow you to load up your own music, but it IS perfectly synchronised and you really feel the music.",76561198018759801,1073,57,673,0,245,1560558397,1466786378,1466786378,True,13,0,0.599294781684875488,0,True,False,False

I completely recommend playing on the hardest setting and really getting into it!  It's a really fun game that requires your whole body, but doesn't take up a lot of space.  I'm pretty in shape and regularly work out, but that didn't stop me from breaking a sweat just two songs in!  I strongly recommend buying this game.  It's one of my favorites so far for my Vive.

Pros:
Good aesthetics.  Not overly complicated, and it stays smooth on my reference R9 290.  Render distance has a bit to be desired, but it isn't bad.
Immersive.  Play with the volume up, and you feel like you're there.
Great use of depth.  Never hurts your eyes to focus on something getting closer or further.
The orbs line up with the music!  I'm a drummer, so I was concerned about this before purchasing.  In fact, it lines up very well and catches subtle differences (it will have you hit on the E, And, and UH of a beat, if the songs has an accent there!)
It's a workout!  I'm sure this could be used as a workout tool for anybody struggling to get motivation to get to a gym.
Decent UI and explorer interface.  Not too complicated.  I'd recommend moving it back a little bit from the user though.  It gets annoying to move my whole head just to see a different song.

Cons:
UI is too close when selecting songs.
More of a question than a con, but if you're short, do you have to hold your hands up higher, or do the orbs fly to where the headset is located?  May be an issue for short people.
Could be the vive, and probably is, but every once in a while I get tracking issues.

For a game-genre that taught civilians that musical timing needs to be tuned to within milliseconds for your gameplay to match up, and taught a million kids how to calibrate their controllers for fractions of a second, Audioshield is a complete fail.

23662697,english,"This is a very physical game.  If you're not really fit, you're not going to do very well.  I've had some physical conditions that limits my movements a bit (probably by only 10% at most) so for me this game is quite difficult.  

First off, basically you stand in the marked spot and hold the two vive controllers  in the appropriate hand and those become shields. One blue and one ""red"" (looks more orange to me).  When a blue blob flies toward you, you block it with the left hand, and when a red blob flies toward you, you block it with your right.  Occasionally a big purple blob flies at you and for that you put both hands together to make a big purple shield.

Sounds relatively simple right?  Well, it seems to me like the game likes to throw blue blobs on your right hand side and red blobs on your left hand side (requiring a big reach to hit it in time) a lot.  These kinds of motions cause me enough pain that it's rough to do quickly.  I try to compensate by turning my body more but it's still a fast motion.

So I'm getting ahead of myself.  First off, there's several kinds of shots to block.  The single ball (like a eighth note), the ""Comet"" type which is a ball with a streamer behind it (like a quarter note or more)  and then the stream of balls that curves across your view (which would be either like an arpeggio or a slurred note depending on your point of view).

You're graded on your accuracy (how many of the shots did you block?) as well as an artistic measurement which goes by how you moved to block the shots... did you move a lot? Were you standing mostly still?  Were you punching hard or just a little?I had enough on my plate trying to merely stand still and block so the most I did was try to punch each shot or slap it down as it came in my reach and after a while that starts to wear you out.

For music, this game can use your mp3s (though it prefers high quality music and some of your songs may be tagged as ""low bitrate"".) In a way though this game is like Audiosurf.  you move to hit/catch certain things that are flowing to the beat.  Most of the songs you'll find with a good leaderboard are the ones that are included from Soundcloud.  Remixes and mashups galore! 

I don't know if there's any check to see if a song is actually the song it purports to be, so it may be like audiosurf there as well (where you could have someone playing the 3 minute radio edit vs someone playing the 12 minute club remix on the same leaderboard).

Anyway, if you need a workout and don't mind working up a sweat (which is easy to do) then this could be a big help to your exercise program.  For me personally I find it a bit TOO active.  There should be a way to group songs by how much motion is required... I hoped there'd be a more mellow mode but so far I haven't found one.

This would be another one I'd give a ""meh"" rating to, but since I didn't have any trouble playing it (other than my old man bones creaking) I'll still give it a thumbs up.",76561197969913402,3168,216,142,0,77,1523671319,1466392143,1466392278,True,6,0,0.620014727115631104,0,True,False,False

Are you super picky about what songs you want to play? Don't buy it then, because whatever witchcraft it is that charts these songs is not super good at it. Some can be good, others can be great, but most fall towards mediocre. 

Are you looking for a fun rhythm experience, without being too concerned about exactly what songs you can play? Buy it!

Only certain types of music shine with the charting software, and the community manages to pick these ones for you.

I was a pretty huge Rock Band entusiast when that started, but I did my best to not go in to this game with that kind of mentality, since I know that the songs are charted on the fly.

 The game has many many reasons to be bought:

-With a price of 19.99 Euros, it is one of the cheaper VR-titles
-It runs fine, even on mediocre Pc´s
-While playing, the risk of smashing something is rather small, as you do not have to move around a whole lot ( if you aren´t going batshit crazy when playing the game)
-The ability to use your own music is a godsent, but even without a huge music collection, you are provided every day with a playlist of popular songs to play
-The representation of your songs is very often on point, far better than I could ever have imagined! The game is not perfect, as only the most prominent notes are being picked up, even if it isn´t the melody or the bass-line, which is to be expected.
-Leaderboards provide a welcome challenge, and the possibility to be notified by mail, when you have been beaten in a song is a funny addition too

However, there are also a few ( nitpicky ) downsides which aren´t to be ignored:

-For me, the sound output which I activated in the VR menu isn´t being respected, the sound then suddenly coming from my speakers when the game starts, even tho´ I put the output to the HDMI output. I solved the problem by mirroring the sound output to both my speakers and the HDMI.
-The game is far too easy. Even when I pick the hardest difficulty, there have been no songs in which I had under 90% of correct notes
- The music-selection menu gets a bit cluttered, the songs not being separated on pages but one ongoing cluster with all your songs

Furthermore, I have to give the devs credit for fixing reoccuring problems very quickly.

 * Impact detection - If you punch the orbs too hard or swing your hands at them, the crash detection misses them a lot of times. Makes it hard to encourage people to increase their artistic score if they are getting penalized for flailing their arms more.
 * Local songs - The game doesn't take advantage of your steam music collection, nor does it go out and pre-scan music collection folders for artists / song names / genre, etc. You are forced to navigate your folder hierarchy to find songs.
 * They don't show you how long your song is. You just have to play it through first. This led my wife to accidentally start 5-10 minutes into a 30 minute song!

23563674,english,"If you like rhythm games, if you liked Audiosurf, hell if you like music this game is well worth trying.  I have had my Vive for just over a day, I have used it for 5 or 6 hours.  At the time of this review I have 2.7 hours in the game; I stopped because I have to go to bed.

Of all the games I have tried, this is the one I haven't felt the need to stop after 15-20 minutes.  Sure there is a lot of great stuff to do on the Vive (ok not as much as there needs to be but it's a start) and this title I feel is the first thing I will touch when I next put the headset on.

The fact the game connects to Soundcloud means a great amount of music is available to play, otherwise anyone with an extensive music collection on disk will be able play that as well.  The Soundcloud aspect makes it a great way to discover new music.

The gameplay doesn't have to be physically taxing, you can stand there and just move your arms to block the orbs but the game rewards physical activity and punch strength, which helps on leaderboards.

I don't see myself growing tired of the gameplay anytime soon but if I did, the entertainment I have already received FAR exceeds the fairly modest price of $20.  This title is a great tech-demo / proof-of-concept for VR and it is easy for people to learn and feel really good about scoring in the high 90%

How much mileage you'll get from Audioshield really depends on a couple things:

[*]Do you love feeling like a badass but looking like an idiot to bystanders?
[*]Do you want to burn off some calories from all that beer you drink?

The gameplay itself is fairly limited, hopefully they'll add additional ""modes"" at some point that mix things up a bit.

+- I have a huge mp3 collection, but if you dont, it only uses soundcloud for songs. The popular ones on soundcloud are good enough but Youtube access would be a great adition to look for songs (and maybe video playing)
+- UI is not very polished. I cant favourite songs, I dont have access to previously played songs, navigation is slow, it doesnt rememver your shield selection from the previous song, etc. Good enough tho

#2) This game has never crashed,  the interface works just fine once you figure it out and master your wrist movements to cycle through play lists and even if thats not enough and you have a custom music list of 10k + songs you can still search by name.
#3) The rankings are fun,  and while I would like ""something extra"" don't be mistaken this game is ready to play, its very good and worth $20.

Wer von uns kann sich für solch banale Dinge des Lebens, wie Disco und Sport begeistern? Unsere Moves beim Abtanzen werden kaum beachtet. Unsere sportlichen Errungenschaften sind meist zweitklassig. Da bietet es sich doch an, das ganze in die Weiten der virtuellen Realität zu verfrachten und gar garstige Energiekugeln mit unseren Schildern abzulenken. Schilder, die doch wesentlich cooler sind, als das was Captain America so durch die Gegend schleift. Kugeln, die im Takt zu der Musik auf uns einprasseln, die wir ausgewählt haben. Ohne Zweifel, das macht Laune, ist günstiger als Disco und überaus knifflig. Nur die Drinks fehlen halt. Und die Frauen. 

Hätte nicht gedacht, das mir ein Game dermassen Spass macht, bei der ich lediglich mit dem blauen Schild die blauen und mit dem roten Schild, die roten Kugeln abprallenlassen muss. Auch noch nach sieben Stunden. Simpler gehts kaum, aber das Teil rockt. Okay, vielleicht ist es auch nur die Musik, die rockt, aber man fühlt sich tatsächlich grossartig dabei. So grossartig, dass man gänzlich vergisst, wie bescheuert es für Aussenstehende ausschauen muss, die eben keine VR-Brille tragen.

Die Tiefe durch das 3D hilft enorm dabei, die Kugeln rechtzeitig zu erkennen und zielgenau abwehren zu können. Es wirkt da auch gleich ganz anders: Wenn Kugeln im Sekundentakt auf einen niederprasseln, kann sich das sogar bedrohlich anfühlen. Das Zerspritzen in einzelne Tropfen ist dabei ebenfalls sehenswerter als man nach dem Trailer denkt.
Das wichtigste bei diesem Spiel ist natürlich die richtige Musik. Man kann sich bei Soundcloud bedienen und auch Lieder spielen, die das Spiel empfiehlt - sehr hilfreich. Auch die eigene Musikbibliothek kann verwendet werden. Da verarbeitet der Algorithmus aber nicht alle Lieder gleich gut - letztlich ist aber auch da ein Lob auszusprechen, denn alles in allem passt es meist.
Auf Dauer wird das Spiel etwas monoton, da es letztlich nun einmal immer das Gleiche ist, trotzdem kann man es stundenlang spielen und immer mal wieder für ein paar Songs starten.

楼主保持隔几天刷一次VR游戏资讯有一段时间了。音盾这货刚出视频的时候，感觉无非是个VR版的体感音乐游戏！靠着快节奏撩骚撩骚大家内心的Show欲。然后我把宣传视频最大化，对着电脑屏幕跟着玩，我靠就这样被一首歌深度毒害了！玩一盘下来会出汗的有没有！果断趁打折提前下手！
感谢先驱者的评测，楼主懒人，直接放弃VPN，专玩本地音乐。楼主也是个喜欢音乐的人，这货真心抓到了内心G点。游戏不光是一个个波波球那么简单，音乐节奏、音调变化甚至是不同音色都有体现。
举个栗子：专门试了试《泡沫》(请忽略楼主厚德载物有容奶大气吞山河非攻兼爱的品味），听过的都知道这首歌的编曲段落感超浓，就是前一秒打呼后一秒被草尼玛碾过赶脚。体现在游戏里，就是起初一个个龟派气功安详平和，催人尿下，突然就TM天崩地裂流星火雨化身超级英雄了！

期望：多加一些游戏背景、音盾造型等，游戏本体的两个背景都不错，一曲终了总会到处看看。还有，啥时候能体会到官网音乐呢，应该会有不一样的感觉吧？

缺点
- 节奏不明显的歌打起来依旧尴尬
- 很糟糕的UI和加载界面设计：界面有BUG先不说了，UI连歌曲长度等基本信息都不提供。每次都要选择场景和盾牌类型以及观看游戏介绍略显啰嗦繁复。加载过程就是直接把玩家放入全灰的默认场景里，就算是稍微做个加载界面都好啊。游戏中只有写在盾牌上的小计数器能够提供一点点和成绩相关的信息，但是盾牌一直在被挥舞所以基本看不到
- 生硬的评分标准：目前仍以总体打击准确度（配以玩家动作“艺术性”为辅）为评分标准，缺乏一些有意义的判断依据
- 光球经常在视野外飞过来：缺乏左右手协调性引导我忍了，麻烦可不可以在有光球从视野外飞过来的时候给那么一点点提醒？
- 在中国直连服务器很困难：每日推荐的歌不挂加速器[spoiler][strike]VPN[/strike][/spoiler]基本是玩不了的，娱乐性自然大打折扣啦╮(╯▽╰)╭

The major one was how much I had to crane my neck to play, probably because of the type of music I used. If you remember game demos at wal-mart that were on the top of the damn shelf, and you had to look all the way up, then YOU'RE A 90S KID and infinitely more importantly, you know what I'm talking about. If the devs would get on that, maybe tone down the maximum angle, then I can recommend it without hesitation.

That aside, the game's awesome. Doing a dramatic metal epic felt freaking amazing (I recommend ""Chosen Ones"" by Dream Evil) and the game actually feels like decent exercise (or maybe I was a little over-excited!) Must-buy for music-loving VR owners.",76561198030526813,714,13,90,0,67,1529157121,1464140622,1464140622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

23144323,english,"[h1][b]In principle this is a great game — when it works. But it's way too buggy to recommend right now.[/b][/h1]

I want to like this game; I really do. In fact, when I can actually get to an arena and play a song, I enjoy it greatly. But...

[h1]The bugs.[/h1]
It's really buggy. The thing I spend the most time doing is standing around in the featureless void waiting for a song to load, hoping it will work, and eventually taking off the headset to see the ""AudioShield not responding"" message on my monitor. And the waiting! Full disclosure; I have moved my VR computer into a room where I don't have wired network, and the wiki is weak. So it really shows up the programming and design flaws in the interface. Choosing any of my tracks off of my NAS via a network drive is interminable. It takes tens of seconds just to traverse each level of folder; when I settle on a band's folder it takes well over 60 seconds to load the thumbnails. During which time you're stuck in VR limbo -- a lobby would be nice, and maybe some progress indicators, so you can tell how long you're going to wait. When it finally does load some thumbnails, moving the headset produces an astonishing amount of jitter -- they should have used non-blocking code there. Then it usually crashes.

[h1]The beatmapping.[/h1]
As others have noted, it doesn't really feel like you're ""playing along"" as you would in Rock Band. Their beat-mapping algorithm seems limited, and it would be really nice to see it improved. But to be honest I haven't gotten sick of that because I can't get to an arena very often (see crashing, above).

[h1]Cannot recommend.[/h1]
Basically, this is a great pre-release demo that should have been free and a teaser for the finished product, because they clearly haven't finished it yet. So I can't recommend it. But the few times you can get through to actually play a song, and the beats feel like they work? It's a lot of fun.

Pros:
- Mesmerizing visuals
- Great use of tech to adapt to each song
- Fast-paced and fun concept
- Simple mechanics are easy to learn but difficult to master

22969055,english,"TL;DR: Audioshield is hands down one of the most fun games I've ever played. I would buy a Vive for this game alone.

This game absolutely nails the old principle of easy to learn, hard to master. The concept is simple: block the dots with your shields. I found it to be kind of fun and pretty easy on Normal difficulty. Once you increase it to Harder the game really shines. The dots match closer to the music and you have to move quickly. It's great exercise. Not the kind that will make you breathe heavy if you're in shape, the kind where your muscles are sore the day after playing for a few hours. Every genre of music is different so try out different things.

It's not perfect. As I said, it's pretty easy on Normal and not as immersive because the dots don't match the beat well. Some genres of music are less fun. If all you like is slow, boring music this isn't for you. If music doesn't make you want to move this probably won't be very fun. If you're significantly out of shape and overweight you may find it challenging but it could be a great way to get some exercise.

The game crashes. A LOT. Sometimes I get lucky when I launch it and it works. Most of the time it crashes a few times before it's stable. It crashes in multiple places, on launch, on song restart, and on song end. Disabling my second monitor seems to make the Vive more stable although I'm not sure if it helps Audioshield's stability. When it crashes on launch I find restarting the Vive helps.",76561198019691120,398,2,1652,0,1231,1467068796,1463202277,1463202277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

22828899,english,"TLDR: It looks nice, but it's buggy and feels unfinished. The devs seem to be AWOL and ignoring all threads on the discussion page. My advice is to skip this for now. Wait for the sequel or at least for a few more updates in case they actually implement mod support and/or some much-needed bug fixes. I'll update this if it changes. 

Okay, here are my main gripes: 

Gripe 1) The music browser is really, really bad. It's nearly unusuable. If you have a lot of music, you will sit for 30 seconds or more at a time waiting for it to refresh whenever you change folders. Finding a song you want will be a long and tedious process. The search function is slow and doesn't work very well. 

Gripe 2) The mechanic where orbs will speed up and slow down without any warning or indication (presumably to match a beat, though it usually doesn't). That's not really how rhythm games should work. The idea is you're supposed to see the orbs coming and know when they're going to hit based on how far they are. If they stop just out of range and then dash in sporadically and inconsistently, it kind of breaks the rhythm. In some songs it just completely ruins the fun as the orbs are jittering and stuttering and they arrive off the beat instead of when they should. 

Gripe 3) The algorithm for building tracks isn't very good. It would be a LOT more fun if there were some noticeable rhyme or reason to when orbs appear, where they appear from, and which color they are. As it stands it seems to be just random and scattered all over. There are no patterns, there's no emergent beauty; it's just a bunch of dots coming from all over at varying speeds (not keeping tempo) and then not really arriving on the beat at all. You can see how the game is ALMOST something really special, like with a bit more testing and maybe one more game designer with a sense for music somewhere in the mix, it would have become something really great. 

That really sums up my overall impression of this game. With a few improvements it would be amazing. But as it stands right now, it's a disappointment. 

In addition, the game does crash quite a lot, and it doesn't crash gracefully. I've had to restart my machine more than once.",76561197993280776,317,34,2210,0,107,1524039884,1462551400,1463218285,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
22828400,english,"Literally a delightful game, in that there were moments I was filled with delight while playing.  There is something magical about the moment when your movement, the music and the colors filling the screen all align.  

As others have noted it is also exhausting, great exercise.   Hard to put down.  In fact the only time I've run into my controllers running out of batteries while in VR was with Audioshield.  I had lost track of time, and played so much they had run down.  

No other exercise has kept me so enthralled that no matter how tired I wanted to push myself to do more like this does.

Edit - I've now hit 70 hours in this game, and don't see myself slowing down at all.  In fact, as I play the excercise I'm getting has allowed me to play longer before getting exhausted.  This game has staying power that is for sure.

I've found myself playing it every day in order to transform myself into the world of music that I'm normally only able to experience with my ears. With Audioshield, I'm thrown into the music and can feel it, and see it. 

Not only is Audioshield great exercise, but it's very recommendable to a wide audience. Out of all the games I currently own for HTC Vive, it's certainly one of the three best to demo to friends and family.

It helps that I can use my own local music. That said, the Soundcloud based streaming provides some great options to diversify the offerings and make the experience less reliant on collecting a library of songs.

Audioshield isn't perfect, though. The bubbles are inconsistent, resulting in some songs providing far less compelling experienes than others.. I will say that you will get the most out of this game if you enjoy electronic music. Although rock, progressive, pop, and other genres work within Audioshield, they tend not to provide as exciting and dynamic of rhythm for the gameplay.

The idea is great, but somehow it just isn't as fun as I expected. 
You can choose your own songs, which sounds great, but actually isn't, because the speed of the bubbles seems to depend the frequency of bass. 
If it's a quick song with only a few low bass notes, it feels extremely weird, because the bubbles actually stop moving for a second until the bass hits again. At first I thought that it just wasn't running smoothly, but I testet it with different songs and there is definitely a connection.

I expected the general speed of the song to determine the speed of the bubbles and the heigth of the notes influence the position of the bubbles which would feel a lot more intuitive, I think.

22656212,english,"Much like Audiosurf, Audioshield is made to react to not only music from the internet, but to your own music as well. Each motion control is a different color shield, as you frantically or ""artistically"" match them with the corresponding colored bubbles flying at you. The faster the song, the faster the bubble velocity. The harder the difficulty, the better it syncs up to the chosen song, although do not expect the algorithm to be perfect, it's very much like Audiosurf and does not sync well with every single song. Global, local and friendly leaderboards keep track of who's the best at the game for each song, assuming they're not constantly pausing the game. Either way, it is loads of fun within the HTC Vive and probably currently one of the best virtual reality games available on the market. Equipped with a few graphical options and a couple different environments, this extremely immersive, fun and a bit psychedelic game will give you a work out.

Erstmal vorweg, ich war schon damals Audiosurfbesitzer und liebe Konzepte, die Spiele und Musik in ""Einklang"" bringen.

Menüführung ist stellenweise bisschen seltsam...kommt man in den Ordnern mit dem Laserpointer bisschen zu weit nach unten, oder oben, kommt, scrollen die Titel runter bzw hoch. Ausserdem sind die ""Optionen"" nur als ein ziemlich kleines Symbol oben rechts schwer zu erkennen (stand 2016.04.25). Die Übersicht der in dem Ordner vorhandenen Tracks ist mir persönlich teilweise zu groß, da wäre nen Skalier-Slider ganz gut. Ausserdem wären auch ein bisschen mehr Variationen in von den Stadien her nicht ganz so schlecht. Ein Workshop wäre hier wirklich großartig!
Und TROTZDEM...
Ich starte das Spiel, such meine Tracks aus (am Anfang noch zum probieren alle Variationen :D ) und begebe mich in die ganz cool designten Arenas. Ich wehre die aus den Beats und Gesang berechneten leuchtend-schönen Farbbällen mit meinen virtuellen Schildern ab, schwitz' wie Sau, hab tierischen Spaß und guck nach ner kurzen weile auf die Uhr...
Nur um feststellen zu müssen, dass ich schon DREI STUNDEN gespielt hab! Ich war selber total erschrocken, wie derbe man sich in der Audioshield-Welt verliert. 

Hatte noch NIE so viel Spaß daran, mich beim ""spielen"" so auszupoweren!
ENDLICH mal eine geile Alternative zum Fitnessstudio, zu denen ich mich irgendwie immer nicht so hinzwingen kann :D
Freu mich schon auf die nächste Zeit mit dem Game.

Now I play this until my arms and shoulders beg me to stop. Anyone making the argument that VR won't see mass adoption because the HMD is too uncomfortable (or gimmicky, or whatever) needs to play this game. Audioshield is, to put it simply, the purest form of mind-body fusion in an entertainment experience that I've ever had the pleasure of losing myself within. I will play this game forever, most likely. It speaks to me on a level that only rhythm games are capable of doing. And it's in virtual freaking reality! Of course I'm going to keep playing it.

My first day with the Vive led me to believe that The Lab is the best experience for the Vive right now. And while I still feel like the brilliance of some of Valve's demo work (particularly Xortex and Longbow) are overall more impressive, Audioshield is the real meat and potatoes of early VR.

Pros:

+ Surprisingly good sync-up to the music for something automatically generated.
+ Gameplay is consistently fun across different songs and difficulties.
+ Awesome soundtrack, in that the soundtrack is my music and I like my taste quite a lot, thank you.
+ Visuals, while simple, are polished and give you a sense of the music itself washing over you as you play.

Cons:

- likes to crash.  Like quite a bit, though it seems to always be after a song is complete, which is liveable.
- (Personal gripe warning) streams only through Soundcloud.  A significant amount of my music is on Spotify, so if you're like me and use a streaming service for your music (other than SC) then you're out of luck if you don't like the free stuff there.
- If you're really, really picky about how the music syncs, you might be occasionally irritated by the way the game doesn't always line up perfectly.  I have a decent sense of rhythm though, and I'm not really bothered by it.

It has some UI issues, occasionally long load times, and other minor bugs, but it seems as though most of these issues will be easily ironed out over time.

22469176,english,"For a detailed breakdown video, watch here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsStC-yKJWc

[b]Room Size Requirements[/b]
If you have 180 degrees of space to swing your arms forwards then you're set. No physical movement around the room is required to play

[b]Performance (on minimum specs)[/b]
Running on ""Ultra"" settings and 2x anti-aliasing with a GTX970. Performance is perfect, no frame drops.

[b]Level of immersion[/b]
This is very dependant on the choice of song. Audioshield allows you to play any music you own, or from online sources such as soundcloud. If you enjoy the music you're playing then you'll easily lose yourself in this world. So if you're not feeling it, try some different songs or genres until you get the ones that fit you. I find high energy songs, or songs with a strong beat work best.

[b]Method of movement[/b]
Mostly standing (or dancing). It's all 1-1 tracked movement, no teleporting or being thrown around.

[b]Comfort[/b]
Overall very comfortable experience. A washable cover for your HMD would be ideal, as you'll find yourself sweating after high energy songs. Sometimes the notes fly down from very high above you, meaning you have to look up at a steep angle. An option to lower the maximum height of the notes would be ideal to prevent any neck strain. 

[b]Interaction[/b]
The haptic feedback is what makes this game. Everytime you hit the notes, you get feedback which makes it feel like you've hit something that's physically there. It does wonders for the immersion. The shields are perminately attached to your controllers, so it's super easy, no fiddling around to pick things up.

[b]Social[/b]
If you're wearing headphones, it's not fun for everybody else in the room who can't hear the music. So a speaker setup is needed for a social experience, and is fantastic when everybody can enjoy and dance to the music too.

知らなきゃそっちの体験版があるからやってみよう。

どうやらSoundCloudで配信されている楽曲を用いてのゲームプレイと、ローカルで持っている好きな楽曲でのゲームプレイが可能。
Audiosurf2のときはユーザが上げた曲なのかな、""電マ弱(20秒)""とかいう曲()がヴゥー(20秒)が続くだけというカオスなものがいくつかあったが、今作では今のところそういうものは見ていない。(ちょっと残念!)

選曲はViveコンからレーザーみたいなのが出てるので、それでフォルダーと楽曲を選択する。
SoundCloudの楽曲はデフォルトで正面にでかでかと並んでいるので、迷うこともないだろう。
ただローカル楽曲を探すときはマイミュージックや各ドライブの浅い場所などの場合なら苦労しないが、変に深い場所にあるとそこまで微妙に狙いずらいレーザーで潜って行く必要があるため少々面倒くさい。
あと、(この機能使ったことないから間違ってたらごめんね)楽曲の検索機能もあるっぽいので、100曲以上同じフォルダなんです!という人もそれ使えば探しやすいのではなかろうか。

ゲームプレイは、向かってくるペンキ的な何かを同じ色の盾で防ぐだけなのでとてもシンプルでとっつきやすい。
うまく盾で防いだ瞬間もViveコンから振動が来るので俺防いでる!感があってイイ。
盾の種類は３つ(大・中・小(因みにPVのは大))ある。
私は一度サイズ中でやってみたが、適当に盾をクロスしてるだけで割とペンキを防げたので、サイズ小でプレイするようになった。
また楽曲の難易度もそれぞれ3つ選べるので、各々好きな難易度と盾でプレイしてみよう。

I honestly had 0 interest in this game because it looked so boring in the trailers and I tend to not like rhythm games. I bought it because I kept seeing this game recommended on reddit. 

This is now my most played VR game. When the balls line up well with the music, it feels magical. You just feel powerful. 

The game works best with faster paced, high energy ""simple"" songs. The more layers there are to the music, more likely the balls will not match the song. When the game does not match the song, you feel like you're just punching random balls while the song is playing in the background. This is the game's greatest weakness. I think the developer needs to change the ball making algorithm to use just the lows and highs of a song and kind of leave the mids out of it. 

The game is very buggy for me. It often crashes after 1 or 2 songs.  

I love being able to stream songs from soundcloud since I don't have much of a music collection. The leaderboards keep me coming back. I'm not sure if the leaderboards are actually separated based off difficulty selected or not. 

The game kind of bugs out anytime it loads anything, but you just have to stand still until it's finished loading.  The game only seems to crash before or after a song, so at least at least it crashes at non-critical times. 

Despite all it's flaws that I'm sure will be fixed in time, I highly recommend anybody with a Vive get this game.

22387674,english,"This game is extremely addictive. It has some issues and not for everyone but overall it is an exciting experience.

Pros:
1) Gameplay: The gameplay is extremely simple and the variety of shields gives it enough variety to play with. The different shields essentially determine how you will block the notes and has an impact on your physical motions.

2) Visuals: Honestly the game looks extremely basic and unitneresting just based on videos and pictures. I had many people look at the game running on the monitor thinking it was pretty bland but put on the headset and feel overwhelmed and excited. I myself am guilty of this as well. The impact of the notes on your shieds are bot tactile and visually stimulating. There are often times where the explosions can actually distracting and prevent you from seeing the notes directly after.

Cons:
1) The Music: This isn't a huge issue personally but it is enough so that I must mention it. The game lets you play music off of a limited selection off of SoundCloud so there isn't much to pick from to begin with. Fortunately (or unfortunately for some) it allows you to pick songs files on your harddrive. For someone like me who has a lot of music files, I am able to delve into that library and play songs to no end. However, if you do not have such a collection, you might find yourself playing the same few songs over and over again. 

2) The Algorithm: The game generates notes by analyzing the file and then spitting it back at you. Unfortunately, it isn't as refined as I would like it to be. There are some songs that work extremely well that will make you feel like you are fighting the music itself. However there are other songs that don't feel well represented by the algorithm. The algorithm works extremely well with clear distinctive snares and beats like electronic music and pop songs. Anything else like rock however seems to not play well. Overall I feel like I'm hitting random notes about 50% of the time.

Conclusion/TLDR:
I would recommend this game for the experience itself as it is truly a fun VR experience. If you have a substantial library of music of your own to play with however, this is an extremely worthwhile game. It has addictive gameplay and the different shields will make the same songs feel like a different experience. If none of these apply, than the game probably isn't for you.",76561198025672048,293,4,706,0,562,1515467874,1460515832,1460515984,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Criticism: 

1. Near constant crashes. I often have to open this game 4 or 5 times before it will finally open without crashing. I have also experience crashing after songs end, or when selecting a new song. I've seen others posting the same thing, so I know this isn't just me. I have also experienced a few crashes of the computer while playing, but I don't know that it was audioshield's fault as opposed to an overclock, or SteamVR in general. 

2. There is a feature that allows you to add a new guest player (awesome), however, at the moment you can only do so with the mouse and keyboard as opposed to in VR. Additionally, it appears to be broken in that it will update the score for the guest account and the main account at once, meaning you cannot compare scores amongst local players. 

3. There also appears to be a bug where holding the shields together to form the purple shield works on any color, not just purple.

My only gripe is, and I've seen this in other reviews, is the devs need to upgrade their protocol for generating orbs with the music. 80% of the time you feel like you're just hitting random orbs while your song plays. On the occasions where the orbs are actually in time with the music, it's epic and feels awesome. But the moments don't last long, and then you're back to hitting random orbs that aren't really in time with what you're hearing.

It's quite clichéd, but watching this game doesn't do it justice, you have to play it. It's challenging and matches the flow of the song pretty well, it's not perfect (ymmv, different genres track better than others), but does it ever get exciting when you see a huge wall of notes flying at you just as the song is about to get intense.

I have noticed some issues where if I play a song that I have a local copy of that is listed on the popular tracks list, that the leaderboard doesn't have the same info on it. I don't honestly see a possible fix for this as it's probably because the songs are tagged differently from each other. This occurs in basically every game that you can play your own songs in, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

22284678,english,"If you enjoyed any of the Audiosurf games then this is kind of similar, with procedural generation of levels. It's simplistic in a good way; Audiosurf tended to overcomplicate the game with all sorts of gamemodes when almost everyone played the game in mono mode. The core gameplay is simplistic in the way mono mode in Audiosurf is. But it is also challenging, moreso than Audiosurf. It has that same arcade high score focus but the basic gameplay is overall more fun because it encourages you to move to the music. It's designed from the ground up for VR and it shows. 

It's a comfortable game for VR and I can't imagine anyone getting sick from this. It can also be played in a very small space as you stay in a single position. 

It's not a perfect game and I feel like it needs some polish, specifically in the menus which feel unfinished and clunky to navigate. The curation of tracks could also use work. Personally I don't have any audio tracks on local storage as I stream everything from Spotify and have done so for some time, and I suspect many people are the same. There is Youtube integration but for it to really elevate the game there should be some better curation on offer. It could be as simple as pulling data from the trending and most popular tracks on Youtube. That would keep it fresh, offer 'new' content weekly with little further input from the developer once implemented and prevent the 'most popular' Audioshield list from ending up stagnant as it currently stands. Also the beat detection isn't perfect, and you'll quickly find that like in Audiosurf, some songs are just better to play than others, with the best generally being those with a prominent beat.

22279008,english,"Ever seen Audiosurf? This is what you get when you apply that to virtual reality. The core gameplay comes down to picking out songs on your local machine or available on Soundcloud and surviving the resulting barrage of blue and orange balls which represent your music in the virtual space.  Audioshield is focused on this mechanic alone with laser precision, and completely nails the execution. To this point, I have not had any desynchronization between my controllers and the shields in the game - every note I miss is my fault.

I didn't get sucked in to Audiosurf, though I did enjoy it. However the sense of presence that it's successor gains from being in virtual reality does a great job selling the experience. It's easy to get in to the rhythm and the music and bring some artistic flair to your one-man shield wall. In fact, more active performances from the players are gauged higher than passive renditions. To keep up on the leaderboards as they shake out in this game, I suspect that maintaining an active playstyle will be crucial towards maintaining top spots on popular songs.

What comes hand-in-hand with this Audioshield experience is a break from the sedentary lifestyle from those of us that need it. If you need to trick yourself in to staying a little more active in your day-to-day, it's not hard to work up a sweat in this game and the feedback from the experience will keep you to the routine if you let it.

To answer a question that has come up a lot on reddit and other places, there is no Spotify integration for this game due to the encrypted nature of offline songs from that service. Similarly, Microsoft Groove songs will show up in your list of playable songs with all the proper metadata however no music makes it to the level when you select it.

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Not a lot of included songs with the game it really doesn’t shine unless you import your own. The included songs have a lot of variety and are really good though.
[*]UI is a little weird, I think the difficulty is supposed to be normal, hard, harder but often times I would see the same option twice i.e. Normal, harder, harder. 
[*]Easy, with only three notes (purples are hardly used) it is hard to miss a lot of notes. As far as I know of you can’t fail out of a song like you can in Guitar Hero for missing too many notes. When I would give the headset to someone new they had no trouble playing it on harder without any previous experience with it.

22263112,english,So far my favorite VR game.  Hope to see other games use more haptic feedback in the controllers.  Fluid mechanics give an amazing show.  Minor complaint: Wish you could swat the color blobs more but your shields can't move too fast or it counts as a miss.

Getting a perfect technical score in harder difficulty is possible for certain songs, but it is by no means easy.   Then there's the leaderboard... the damn leaderboard.   If you're competitive, you are gonna try your best to get to the top.  The number of times I kept playing a song over and over trying to reach the top half of the leaderboard is embarrassing.

Think of it as your own private dance party.  Easy reminds me of when playing other rhythm games on easy, helps you learn the mechanics, but switch to the next level quick and it's actually easier as it follows along with the music better.

I haven't tried putting in my own music yet, but the search does a decent job of grabbing most of what I want off SoundCloud so far.  I highly recommend this, it may quickly just become my top VR experience, I have a top 3 and I promise this is in there and won't fade anytime soon.
