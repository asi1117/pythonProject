83074809,english,"Simply the best VR game in my collection.  It works fine on the Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop and an AMD 5700XT -- an occasional hiccup even over 5G, but mostly smooth.  There's a little image ghosting (contrails) but not so much that it bothers me.  I used to play pool when I was young  (for fun not money, but I took it fairly seriously) and now I live miles from the nearest table and have no room or budget for my own.  So VR pool is actually the key reason why I finally broke down and bought my first VR headset!

So I gambled on a fairly expensive headset and a new (to me) technology, hoping that this one app from Steam store would be as good as other reviewers said.  And I am way beyond ""not disappointed.""  First off, VR in general is so insanely cool that I'm hooked.  Secondly, this pool sim is downright awesome.

I could go on for hours and hours about how cool this pool sim is, but let's keep it shortish.  The physics is superb.  The modelling is good enough to be immersive -- at times I try to lean on the table and then feel surprised that it isn't really there.  The ambient acoustics and music are good, the jukebox in particular provides spatial audio cues that really help keep you oriented when teleporting or ""Hulking"" your way around the tables.  Advanced pool shots are modelled as well as vanilla;  as your skills improve you can use back and top spin, ""English"" and even hop shots.

You can play against AIs (who are uneven but fairly challenging opponents) or MP against humans.  Sadly there aren't a whole lot of human players on the servers, though there's a fairly lively player community in the UK.  The AI will give you a good game though.  More than once I've found myself saying ""oh, good leave"" out loud as if I was playing a real person.  You can play 9ball or 8ball with the AI, and I think some other variants like cut-throat with human opponents.  There's no long-term scoring for AI games, other than advancing through levels (each time you win a set of frames, your AI opponent gets better).  

The rules are a little different from the 8ball I used to play 40 years ago.  Scratching on the 8ball shot was a lose when I used to play, but it's only a foul in this game;  and you don't have to call the 8ball pocket (which I think is a weakness in the game, that last shot really should be called).

The game mechanics take a little getting used to at first, but after a couple of practise games you will quickly get the hang of it and it starts to feel ""real"".  I have played a lot of frames against AIs and never get bored, every game is different and I can feel my old skills coming back to life.

It's a big Sports Bar -- there are several other minigames (darts, skeeball, etc) plus a few easter eggs and some silly mischief you can get up to (like throwing darts at the balloon animals).  You'll need to find the jukebox remote control to add your own music (important tip, as it's not in the game menus!).  I can easily ""go down to the bar and shoot pool"" for over an hour listening to my favourite tunes, any time I want to.  Particularly during the pandemic this is a great way to feel like you're ""out of the house"" and having some social time even when stuck indoors.

Now for the not so good news:  this game appears to be an orphan.  The game company (Cherry Pop Games) disappeared off the face of the earth in summer 2019.  I have not been able to find any info about what happened to them.  The game still runs great, but I suspect it is unmaintained and one day will break on a SteamVR upgrade.  The swag features are all broken already (you can earn lots of XP but you can't use them for any of the custom pool cues, hats etc. that are supposed to be on offer in-game).  Something called Playfab Server is not available, so none of those features work.  Fortunately this does not break the core game!

This is far and away the best physics game out there -- better imho than H3VR because I like pool better than guns.  The ambience both audio and visual, the excellent physics, and the good game mechanics make this a truly immersive experience.  It's a solid winner, a great demo of how amazing VR can be... and I'm hoping that if enough people keep buying and playing it, somehow it will get rebooted and continue on Steam.",76561198111914796,157,35,1056,1,832,1645233087,1608852480,1608852480,True,3,0,0.567901253700256348,0,True,False,False

I'm playing on a GTX 970 and a Ryzen 5 3600 with 16GB of RAM and when I started, it was a super laggy. Of course my graphics card is the lowest specs but the game didn't optimise to my PC at all, which is quite annoying since I needed to go through a bunch of menus and tutorials before getting to the settings. Once you turn down the settings though it runs smooth so if I can run it, then you should too. 

This is one of the older VR games so there is no snap turn. Instead you turn by using the grab buttons and rotate your hands so the world turns around you. You do get used to it quickly but it's a shame there is no snap turn. You navigate using by blinking or teleport which I think suits this game okay. There is no option for locomotion or continuous movement. This also has both left and right hand support although you have to select that at the start every time which was a strange choice since all other options are in the settings. 

This game also hasn't been updated in a while so it is possible with future headsets this game could lose support but I can at least confirm that the quest can play this.

I've not tried anything else yet - the first thing I tested was the pool table.

1. the pool is my favourite and the graphics are much sharper overall on rift s and the game itself is worth the price whether playing with a friend or ai.. i had no issues with tracking and cue.
2. i hit a 180 on darts, so no issues there.
3. the online as people said seems to be a bit empty in every region, but im not sure on other days or times, however 2 guys showed up and we ended up having a laugh with pool. so i know it worked online as a test.

OVERALL = games like this are essential, especially in times of lockdown or not. there is so much potential nowadays with vr and this just proves it. 
if you imagine buying a real pool table, having to find the space and people to play with, its no easy task.....if however you own a vr, you can spend £14.99 and have a virtual pool table with no extra room needed. even if you had no friends, being able to play the ai is still worth the price, especially if in real life you had nobody to play with anyway.
i will keep this game as it clearly works and loved the idea to play online.....if you have your own friends to join or manage to get others luckily like me. the pool is just sooooooo much fun and hope they or someone can add snooker one day. PLEASE.

58359057,russian,"Ребят!!! Это просто божественно! Особенно речь идёт про бильярд. Я во много VR-игр поиграл, помногу-понемногу, но в этой игре я буду зависать всегда. После нескольких партий в бильярд, я влюбился в это потрясающее творение. Должен отметить, что я сам по себе люблю бильярд, но только в этой игре он превосходит все цифровые аналоги. Графика потрясающая, шары аж переливаются, словно отражают, в общем - невероятно красиво.
Игра запускается на средних настройках графики, так что эту красотищу можно улучшить в ещё большей степени.
В бильярде (Остальные плюшки - мини-игры - я не затрону) можно, при надобности сменить руки - которая держит и которая бьёт кием. Это если приспичит. В итоге я приноровился на одних руках так и играть, там сами поймёте - почему. Позицию можно выбирать хоть невдалеке от стола, по борту, или даже переместившись, при надобности, сквозь стол. Шары можно подкручивать, это просто супер. Ударять накатом или с оттяжечкой, наворачивать влево или вправо - всё доступно, только разбирайтесь подотошнее в удобном управлении.
Перемещение реализовано крайне интересно. Зажимая ГРАБы и ведя одной рукой вперёд, а другой назад, вы разворачиваетесь на месте, или можно подтягивать или отдалять реальность от себя. И, что самое главное, можно зажать ГРАБы и КУРКИ и поднимать-опускать пол, например, - чтобы лучше отрегулировать высоту над бильярдным столом, и правильнее ударить кием по битку.
Бильярдов два или больше вида. Как минимум - Восьмёрка и Девятка, вроде, ещё что-то есть. Я просто люблю только Восьмёрку.
В общем, теперь частенько буду пропадать за несколькими партиями в день в этой обалденнейшей игре.
Ух, красотища там, не описать!
Купил на распродаже, за 200 с чем-то рублей, но теперь бы, если бы знал, какой там бильярд и управление и графоний - не пожалел бы за сие чудо и пары тысчёнок. Да и даже больше, не сомневаюсь. На этот бильярд я конкретно подсел.

47686754,german,"Ich mag das Spiel und die Idee. Es ist gut wenn du Billard in wahren 3D (VR) spielen kannst.
Aktuell beinhaltet das Spiel eine Kneipe (Tutorial) mit 1 Jukebox wo man zwischen vordefinierten hintergrundsongs und 3 Spielen wählen (Airhockey, Dart und Billard) kann. Airhockey und Billard sind gut entwickelt und bei Billard liebe ich wie man die Richtung und die Geschwindigkeit einstellen kann und wie man den Cue hält. Einzig bei Dart ist es komisch. Wenn ich instinktiv auf die Scheibe schieße (wie ich es in echt machen würde) dann fliegen die Darts weit über das Spielfeld und die Dartpfeile fliegen auch nicht gerade. Ich bin mir nicht sicher ob die Sensoren falsch arbeiten oder das Spiel, aber meine Pfeile fliegen leicht nach links. Ich benutze eine Oculus Rift und bin ein rechtshänder. In der offiziellen Spiel-Kneipe (also nicht das Tutorial) kann man auch Schach, Dame, ein Ballspiel, Puzzel ein Reflextestspiel und ein Shufflespiel spielen

Die Rotation (Ausrichtung des fov in der vr) ist nicht so gut und mir wird ganz übel von dem weichen zur seite drehen (Ich hoffe die ändern dies zu irgendwas was ähnlich wie bei vrchat ist).

Pro
- Richtiger Spass (auch Mehrspieler)
- Nette Umgebung

Contra
- Rotation mit den Triggerbuttons (macht schwindelig/übel)
- Die Möglichkeit zu sehen welche Kugel eingelocht wurde, fehlt.
- Dart fühlt sich etwas verbuggt an

Zusammenfassung: Das Spiel macht richtig spass und ist nicht sehr teuer. Die Benutzung der Controller wurde großartig umgesetzt (ausgeschlossen bei Darts) und die Steuerung fühlt sich gut an. Ich kann das Spiel klar empfehlen.

I like the game and the Idea. Its good when you can play Billard in real 3D (VR). Actualy the Game contains a Bar (Tutorial) with 1 Jukebox where you can switch through predefined backgroundsongs and 3 Games (Airhockey, Darts and Billard). Airhockey and the Billard is greate developed and by Billard i love how to set direction and speed and how to hold the cue. Only by Darts its wired. When i shoot instinctively (how i do in real) the darts goes wide upper the board and also the darts dont fly straight. Im not sure that the sensors work wrong or the game but my darts fly soft to left sided. I use a Oculus Rift and be a right-handed. In the official Game-Bar (Not Tutorial) you can also play Chess, Checker, a Ballgame, Puzzle, Reflextestgame and a Shuffleboardgame. 

The rotation (adjusting fov in vr) is not so good and i will be sick from that smooth sidescrolling (i hope they change it something how like in vrchat).

Pro
- Real fun (also in Multiplayer)
- Nice envoirement

Contra
- Rotation with the triggerbuttons (makes sick)
- The ability to see what balls have been potted, left
- Darts feels a bit buggy

Conclusion: The Game makes fun and is not so expensive. Using of Controller was great realized (excluding darts) and the Control feels good. I recommend that game.",76561198131632892,432,78,95,0,70,1599160509,1545420970,1545702196,True,5,0,0.599618673324584961,0,True,False,False

It's so unpolished that it's laughable. I played pool against an AI earlier, the balls would stop rolling in one place and suddenly it was the next shot and they were in completely different spots. I pocketed a ball at least twice just for the game to decide ""nope that didn't actually happen"" put the balls in a different spot, and let the AI go. 

The Air Hockey is really subpar as well. The movement of the paddle is not 1:1 mapped to the movement of your controller. this results in a VERY laggy feel and makes it hard to play.

Overall this game has a lot of potential but it's not living up to it. Given my past experiences with this developer. They may add a few more features but they will likely never fix the problems, and then they'll abandon it for the next pub game simulator they make.

Multiplayer worked fine but it seems most like to play pool, it's a shame more weren't playing the game Reaction as that is a lot of fun, air hockey is fun too.

3 things I feel need improving, first thing is how one turns around, you have to press both triggers and move one to the left or right, it works but it's not ideal, why is there not the option to free turn.  

Also if you're facing the wrong way, a big message is in your face telling you to turn around, it's annoying, especially if you're running 3 sensors on the RIft.  The game says it's roomscale so why is this message even popping up.

3rd issue is that when playing pool, you can move right over the table and take your shot, that's just silly to be standing in the middle of the table, although you don't see your body, the point is that in reality that's what you're doing sometimes.

I just got out of this experience after hanging out for an hour! Watch my video; I did everything, and there was a few other players whose party I crashed. (Both he and the AI won the game of pool).

First, I played the tutorial, which is like your own personal area with each game for you to practice on. Then you enter the main bar, which is much larger. It is quite expansive and has decent looking NPC/models, which I was a nice touch, and I think that gives just about any VR experience a greater sense of presence, even if they just stand around. There is a VIP room, and a nice unlock system. You play skeeball (and such) and reclaim the tickets for useless junk, just like in an actual arcade. [i]All of this, combined with multiplayer and the actual pool/billiards component (which is executed perfectly) gives it a strong replay value.[/i]

This game has been around for along time. It used to be called Pool Nation, did you know that? Now you do! I checked out back then and the main area looks familiar to what there is here, and it's still the same thing, but like double the content. I sheepishly waited for a sale (It's still 33% off), but you can buy it at full price without worry. This should compete with full on VR social platforms. For VR titles where only like 2-10 people on the entire planet will be playing at one time, they should put you in a multiplayer session by default, eh? Has anyone ever tried that?

+ Nice graphics
+ Multiplayer - play with your friends! However, online physics is sometimes strange because it is processed locally (for example each player see different result from a single dice throw)
+ Many options - physics, difficulty, graphics, sounds... you can adjust everything for the best experience
+ Many games - pool is the main game here (only game with AI you can play with), but you can also play air hockey, darts, chess, ...
+ Customization - you can unlock hats, pool cues, table textures and other items (unlocking is quite slow though), and you can play custom music in the bar

- Own aim settings in online match - I would expect online games to be set either with aim assist or without it. There is even setting for ghost ball at the start, but each player still can set this up individually and have huge dis/advantage.
- Disorienting teleportation - when teleporting around pool table or darts, it always adjust your rotation to direction you are looking which may be more disorienting than useful

    进入游戏之后，我就是一脸大写的懵X，不愧为小游戏集合，目前的版本里面已经有台球、国际象棋、沙狐球、飞镖，据官方说正式开放后还会添加空气曲棍球、跳棋、滑雪球等各种休闲小游戏。
玩这个游戏建议各位还是站着玩，因为除了国际象棋之外，其他项目需要肢体上的动作都会比较大。我首先尝试的是台球，和死党切磋了一局。操控上来说还是比较简单的，只要握住手柄然后瞄准，撞球就可以了。如果长时间打台球的话，还是建议各位盆友搞个桌子放上桌面小球来定位，楼楼站着用地毯玩台球基本坚持了1小时腰就比较酸了。
也许你会觉得《运动酒吧VR》就是一款单纯的酒吧游戏，其实它的可玩性比单纯的酒吧游戏要多的多。在这里你能够找到让你自己减压、放松的最佳途径。像国际象棋、跳棋以及主打的桌球游戏都是回合制的，模拟现实中真实的游戏方式，你可以时不时的休息一下。
游戏支持单人或6名玩家在线同时进行游戏，制作组为其定制了物理效果，也就是说除了游戏中已经有的打台球、冰壶等项目，你也可以选择和朋友搞点新事情。例如即兴棒球（击打放置在台球桌边框上的玻璃瓶）、用书来盖高楼游戏、抢凳子游戏、多米诺骨牌游戏等。
游戏进行了物理效果的模拟，但是不够精细，比如击打台球时，没有提供震动反馈，啤酒瓶也没有洒落液体的效果。
虽然细节上处理的不够出色，但游戏最大的用途恐怕就是联络联络感情，然后和朋友瞎闹一番，放松压力，愉悦心情了。从这个出发点上来看，游戏还是不错的。

[h1] Locomotion [/h1]
This is a room-scale game so you can walk around. They use a blink mechanic for most locomotion with a slight fade.
The other option is to grab and pull the world around you (surprising if you don't know about it, very useful afterwards)

[h1]Review[/h1]
I've seen this game improve over time, but will try and focus on the current state of things.
The pool controls are easy to use and allow you to add spin (or ""English"" I believe?) to the ball.
The AI at easy has a mix of good and bad shots, which helped me to learn.

I enjoy playing it on my own against AI, with friends online, or via hotswapping the headset in person.

The music is customizable but the default adds to the atmosphere and the bar itself is quite nice!

~~~~~~~~~~

Hey guys, I know a fantastic bar where the atmosphere is great - good music, TVs everywhere to watch your favourite sports and plenty of games to play.  You can’t miss it! Put on your VR headset and it should be right in front of you! Come on in and let’s have fun at SportsBar VR.

SportsBar VR is a casual / sports simulation game where you immerse yourself in a virtual bar and play a variety games, the likes of which can be found in real bars and clubs. 

What a cool bar we have here – there’s an old-style jukebox in the corner, several pool tables in from the bar. Oh, have a look at this! Let’s play rampball, darts, air hockey . . . what’s that? You want to play chess? Be my guest, here is a chess table and right beside it a checkers table, too. I’m off play to something else for a while. 

There are fun games in this venue and the most important point is that they are easy to play with the Vive controllers. I had a few turns at pool and air hockey against online opponents and I must admit it was fun. I really like the feel of pool cane - I was surprised how realistic it was; just brilliant!

The rampball was ok; you have nine balls and if you reckon you’re a top baller, show us how to get nine hundred points with nine balls – I’d love to see that!  The darts game was ok, too, but I personally did not like the feel when you throw the darts; you either throw them too softly or too hard, the motion is not quite there in my opinion. I was better at throwing darts at the balloons and seeing them fly into the air! As for the air hockey, that was good too, as I mentioned above, but it took me a while to get properly used to the mallet - it could be a little bit smoother. 

There are also objects that you can pick up to throw at people, or even build a house of chairs, books, dominos or cans of beer. Yes, there are bottles of beer that you can smash against the wall, but I prefer to juggle with them!
You’ll receive presents too; how nice is that? With these you came customize how people see you online. There is also the option to upload your own music.

SportsBar is graphically polished.  The controls with the pool game are great but need to be better for the darts and the rampball in my opinion.  The atmosphere is spot on and now I can go to a bar without leaving home - safer and healthier. 

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

-	Polished Graphics
-	Several games to play
-	Great atmosphere
-	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	Controls could be better in some games
-	No trading cards

The bar atmosphere is well done. Are you ready for a game of pool, darts, chess and more? Take your pick, mate - we’ll be waiting for you!

30091495,english,"The environment and atmosphere of this game is excellent.  The experience feels like you are walking into your own bar without smelling like a lot of cheap booze, the feeling of sticky floors, and coming out with clothes reaking of dirty smoke. 

The pool, airhockey, and table shuffleboard games are very good as far as realism and physics, darts seemed ok, other games like skeeball are not very realistic at all.  Skeeball tables I found very disappointing.  They feel too high and don't feel like the floorbase ones you find in most arcade centers.   There was something about the ball movement that did not feel like it had the right roll as far as weight, gravity, and speed.  It also did not feel like it had the right pop you feel with a wooden ball when it goes into the air and then bounces around.

I understand this simulator is best for its pool table simulation and not the other games that are included.  I refunded the game because I felt the game was too empty being a single player.  The game felt hard to come back to for replayability.  I didn't see many people online to play multiplayer and I felt very bored after awhile walking around an empty bar.   This will be a great simulation if more people can be found playing.  There is an area in the game where alot of AI are standing about but, I didn't find a way to play single player against AI, other than shooting pool by myself.  

I recommend this game if you want to shoot pool with some friends and they are willing to join and play with you.  If you are single player and looking for others to play, you will get bored rather quickly.  The other games included (other than the pool) don't feel as refined to real world physics as the pool simulation does.

29915453,english,"This game promises so much but fails to deliver, due to the awkward way you have to move around the table.
It looks great and is fun but it soon becomes frustrating.
It would be much better if there was a decent way to turn your player around, without having to keep tying yourself in knots.
Just a simple button press to do a 90 degree clockwise turn would do it.
Currently theres a ""Hulk mode"", you hold both triggers and move the controllers. It's slow, imprecise and nauseating.
It's such a pity because it plays lovely, when you can get into position, but all too often I find myself quitting because it just takes miles too long and is unintuitive.
Another major problem is the fact that you have to choose your handedness before entering the bar.
I play pool left handed and darts right handed. I can't swap over and play the other way but once in the bar your handedness is set, if you want to change you have to quit out, start again and change handedness.
Like I say it's awkward and unintuitive and the devs don't help much either, simply choosing to ignore most discussion threads.
In it's current form I just can't recommend it.
IF the devs get these things sorted out it could be a fantastic title, but with poor controls, poor movement and poorly implemented features then it will continue to be a title I visit for 5 or 10 minutes at a time, before quitting in abject frustration!

3/10

I will update this review if things change for the better!

Here is an update to my review.
After several comments and discussions, with the developers, they have implemented changes that address almost everything I originally complained about, the main one being my complaint about rotation.
This has now been sorted and makes a huge difference to the game.
I just tried it from a seated position and it was working fine, will try standing when I get more time but it's much improved.
It's so nice to have contact with developers who listen and act to improve things.
While it's still not perfect it's much much better and as such I can now recommend it!

7.5/10

I will continue to update as things improve :)

12th Jan 2021 update.

I've recently purchased a rift s and have just had another go on this game and it has gone precisely nowhere in 3 years.

Movement and positioning is still absolutely awful and leaves you disoriented and tangled.

An easy solution would have been to use left stick to rotate, right stick to move forwards and backwards.

It's no fun constantly fighting the controls to get into position.

It looks great but once the wow factor wears off you're left with a clunky and awkward game that is more trouble than it's worth.

The thing is, with a bit more thought this could have been fantastic.........but it's awful...

I'm more than decent at billiards; bar table or 9ft, 8-ball or 9-ball, house cue or my own; I can run a table well enough and in this ""game"", I was lucky to sink a single shot. A large part of that is the fact that I'm hovering in space, not setting up a bridge on a real table so it's inherently unstable. The ""lock"" system would take care of that, except that there's not a stable way to get a shot setup and nothing to even assist in that such as a dampened movement system (something between the free and locked modes perhaps?). While walking around, the graphics are pretty, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this and I SO wanted to love it.

Multi-player seems to be a bust too. I waited at least 30 minutes for a 9-ball game and never got an opponent.

All that might have even been tollerable if I didn't have those damn ""lock"" dialogs in my face the whole time. There was a settings option to turn off hints, but that didn't remove them and there wasn't much else to tweak. The same issue made darts impossible because the dialog was between my face and the dart board.

There don't seem to be many online players.  It can take while before you find people to play with.  This game should be cross platform with Playstation to increase the general player-pool.
Also, the speech audio could be slightly improved.  Such as when a player speaks farther away it is more silent.  Because when 6 players are in the room speaking with each other, the dialogue can get very chaotic and it can be hard to know who's talking to who.

27361291,english,"This is one of the most satisfying VR experiences I've had with my Vive yet. The incorporation of all sorts of little interactions into the environment really elevates the experience-- it's an excellent simulation of playing pool in a virtual world, yes, but it's also an excellent virtual simulation of [i]being at a bar with your friends playing pool[/i], which-- let's be honest-- is really what most of us are enjoying most about the game of pool. The ability to goof off and play darts while your opponent is shooting, or dump a pile of broken beer bottles on the table, or throw the jukebox at them, turns the whole thing into a social space in which you are playing games, not merely a game you're playing in virtual reality.

I often play it via the internet with a friend who also owns a Vive, and it's amazing how well the position and orientation of one head and two hands, by themselves, can perfectly convey almost the full range of identity that standing in the same room as the person does; the guy on the other side of the table is recognizably my friend, even though he's just a head, hat and two hands. When he makes gestures or laughs at me, you can see it in his avatar.

Unexpectedly, it's also a solid ab workout-- there isn't a real pool table for you to lean on, so you end up using those muscles to position yourself properly in space.

Highly recommended if you own a Vive.",76561197960941484,766,8,123,0,123,1466976083,1480038146,1480038146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

　　《台球国度 VR》中用的是花式台球，不过没有收录所有的花式台球玩法，只选取了其中的美式花式十六球、8球、9球三种玩法。这三种玩法普及度非常高，多数台球玩家都能在其中选取到自己喜欢的玩法。
　　对于新手玩家，游戏友好又悄无声息地设置了新手教程环节，之所以这样说是因为游戏没有明确的文字指令告诉玩家该怎么做，而是通过红白色圆圈告诉玩家可以这样做或者不可以，让玩家更多地自己去摸索。
　　人与人之间的对战一直都是最有意思的，对战过程中，双方的语音对话功能会被开启，玩家之间可以聊天。遇到谈得来的朋友不妨调出没有酒的啤酒瓶干杯，误击也可以商量放水一把，遇到神级对手偶尔也可以搞搞破坏用东西挡住他的视线……游戏的自由度可谓是非常非常高。
　　人机对战下，玩家可以调整系统方的难度等级。如果遇到一杆清级别的“对手”，那就只能默默看着了，所以玩家还是估量一下自己的水准，找一个旗鼓相当的对手来做练习对象吧。
　　自由模式和人机对战模式很类似，区别只在于有没有一个对手罢了。不过偌大的娱乐室里就自己一个人在玩，会感觉格外孤单和无趣。
　　通过HTC Vive看到的画面会比截图当中来的清晰，画质也会相对好很多，但是建模和场景空的问题还是比较严重，不过我们关注这个游戏的时间比较久，看到了小游戏一直在持续更新，所以对于这个问题我们还是报以期待。
　　游戏自由度令人惊叹，收录的玩法普及度与真实感都很高，就68元的价格而言，该游戏可以说是物美价廉。
　　非常推荐给喜欢台球游戏的玩家用以练习球技。

I enjoy shooting pool but have never owned a table IRL, so now I can play anytime in VR! It's nice to play a game or 2 even on an open table to just relax in the evening.

It's a perfectly immersive poolhall with (at time of writing) 8-ball, 9-ball, open table, darts, air hockey, and skeeball. The ball physics are good, and you can turn on cue ball spin. There's an AI player to play against, but even a low level 1 AI will sometimes run the whole table off the break and do trick shots. (I swear the AI is hustlin' me!)
You can also queue to find a random live human player, and this game really shines when playing with a real person with the voice-chat on. You really get the sense of presence that you're both together in a poolhall and not in your living room (or where ever your PC is) somewhere unknown.
There's an XP bar and levels for your account, leveling up unlocks cosmetics: hats, cue stick colors/types/art, and table felt art.

To move around you can walk around via your roomscale space, teleport (with a sticky option to get you at the edge of the table, very handy), and grip & push/pull the world around you which is nice to get right into position.

Definitely a must-have VR game for me.
Worth $20, especially if you compare the cost of an evening (or 2) at a real poolhall.

24473262,english,"While playing this game I accidentally knocked over a full can of beer.   I immediately rushed to grab it and stop it from spilling except there were two problems:
[olist]
 [*] The can wasn't open
 [*] The can was in VR
[/olist]

I really surprised myself with my default reflexes of ""oh shit I better catch that!""  

So basically this is Pool in VR.  More ""Virtual Pool"" than  ""[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/336150/]Virtual Pool[/url]"" is... (though I would have argued Virtual Pool was pretty realistic back in the late 90's).  You have a few tables, a jukebox, a couple of dart boards, a bar with a bunch of bartenders doing the ""I gotta pee"" dance. A few bar patrons also doing the same ""I gotta pee"" dance.  And that's enough to remind me of weekends hanging out at Rusty's Billiards. 

The coolest thing is, you could play darts if you wanted to, you can change the music on the jukebox (though it seems like they only have a handful of songs), you can conjure yourself up a beer... bottle.  It's empty though, so no getting virtually drunk and starting a virtual bar fight.

There's also a multiplayer mode which I have yet to try but it looks great.  There's only one thing missing:  Something to lean on as you make your shots.  If I had a real world ""surrogate table"" to play against, this game would be so very awesome.   It's still great though, don't get me wrong.  It just kinda ruins the immersion when you have to hover your arms in the air while taking a shot.  

Things I liked about this game: 
[list]
 [*] They really nailed the bar atmosphere.  The only thing that would make it more authentic would be to have it filled with smoke and have some arcade games off in the corner... Oh and maybe a selection of cue sticks to choose from and some chalk for the tip of your cue.
 [*] The tables are my favorite color for pool tables (though I could see some people wanting the traditional green felt)
 [*] Darts!  
 [*] They give you 8 ball and 9 ball at least. I would like more game options (rotation? Straight pool?) but 8 and 9 ball are a good start.
 [*] Makes good use of all the available room scale game space
[/list]

Things I didn't like: 
[list]
 [*] Aiming without something to lean on is really awkward and ruins the immersion (This is not really the game's fault though)
 [*] The people seem to be a BIT on the small side.  Like the height is ok, but their body size is super skinny...  it's a small complaint really because the main focus is the game, not the people standing around, but I feel like they could make the people a bit wider.  Imagine a 5'2"" girl stretched out to 5'6"" and that's how it seems  Squish her height back down to 5'2"" and she looks fine, but stretched out she seems unnaturally skinny...uncanny valley style.
 [*] Only two pool games (8 and 9 ball) and the dart game seems like there's not much to it yet other than throw the darts and look at the score on the wall.
[/list]

I really didn't have that many complaints with this game, except for the AI really is kinda lame at the easiest level, but it always is... I feel like the AI lets me win on the easiest level, and the level 3 AI is the closest to the real ""novice"" player. 

So anyway, my recommendation is: find something like a barstool to lean on so you can take your shots more realistically.  Don't forget to pick it up and carry it with you (or else teleport everywhere) or you might be tempted to put your hand down on thin air and fall to the floor.

They recently added in air hockey, there's a set of large dominos you can setup and tip over, and a digital dart board (that said, throwing darts in VR is anything but easy. Well, throwing them is easy, throwing them accurately...not so much).

The physics on the ball are good, and supposedly if you turn off ghost ball and some other feature you unlock 'pro mode' where the ball physics are more or less perfect to real life (the only issues you'll have with ghost ball on will be trying to do backspin across half a table length or more; it won't curve durng the shot as it would IRL).

English (the ball physics property, not the language) is supported, so you can safely backspin a pocket shot to recall a ball across the table or avoid pocketing the cue ball. Jump shots also exist.

24417109,english,"Read fully: I do like this game a lot but it takes some getting use to since there is no table to lean on and looking at where to hit the ball can be tricky if the game is not clear which is a problem for me. The update today hopefully addressed that issue. I have a GTX 970 video card so maybe that is the reason for not optimal visuals but VR devs need to support at least down to these cards since a lot of people have them I think. The physics in the game are pretty good also. You can do most of the tricks you do in real life in VR.
Air Hockey is live now and it is fun but again there is a small learning curve since you can't actually hold the strikers. Also, today's update you should be able to use a real table (as a pool table) and set up the height so you can use it to play on when in game. I have a short video of the Air Hockey and already have a video up on Steam and YouTube of the pool play. Have fun in the bar.
https://youtu.be/V9wlIbQfNtY

Update to my review: I have a GTX 1070 and the graphics still look the same. I only get 45fps on high and ultra. When I look close at things they are very clear. Why can't they just make it so when you look from afar it is still clear? The whole bar has a blur to it. Other games can do clear so I don't understand their method of coding in this game. You may ask why I don't turn the settings to medium or low? Well because the game looks worse at those levels even though the FPS is higher.

The devs just added more graphical tweaking settings to the game. Finally. A video to show you below.

- Multi-person rooms,   Theres like 20 odd tables in the room would be nice if they were in use by other people.
- Ability to not have trolls interfere with the table (or make them invisible).   A way to toggle this would be nice, some times it can be fun but other times you just want the pot!

23651287,english," I'm a pretty amateur pool player and have on a very casual interest in real life in pool.  I mean amateur in the ""oh look I hit a ball, yay"" kind of amateur.  Yet I love this game.  It's one of the best, most full featured games on the Vive currently.  

The Pool Hall itself is fully realized with loving detail to explore.  A full physics engine lets you mess around with basically anything in the environment in some cool ways.  Menus are a breeze to navigate.  Playing pool feels very natural and inuitive after only a few minutes.  I don't know if these skills I'm gaining would transfer that well back to real life, but I have a feeling at least the knowledge I'm gaining would.  At the very least, I can already feel a real sense of progression in my ability after only playing a dozen or so games of this and that feels great. 

Now if the developers could just find a way to make self aware AI for the sole purpose of letting me make my opponents feel shame when I beat the AI.  I want that birthday hat wearing bastard to feel HUMILIATION when I take him down.

Pros:

-Great looking game with a nice hazy hool hall atmosphere; amazing in VR
-Great online multilplayer.  Finding random games or inviting friends to play is a breeze and very snappy.
-Great unlock system with hats, new pool tables, cues, etc.
-Great inuitive controls that feel very natural
-Nice assists for new pool player such as the ghost ball telling you where your ball will hit before you shoot.

Cons:

-Could use some sort of Single player ladder/tournament (right now just AI matches which are still a good deal more fun than you'd expect though)
-Only two players per game/lobby.  It would be great to let more people hang out in a game/hall or have multiple games going on in the same space.
-No Self Aware AI to make victory over robot overlords feel totally sweet.

The pool mechanics work VERY well. Was concerned about how it would work without having an actual table to lean on, however they solve this by implementing a sort of ""lock-on"" system to fine tune your shot. Very effective. What really makes this game shine is its one of a kind, holy-crap-this-is-the-future multiplayer. You and one other player can walk around the pool hall, play darts, throw bottles at each other, and of course... shoot some pool. What makes this experience unique is how immersive and how realistic the other player's movements translate into their avatar. I played against a total stranger. I could not get my mic to work for voice chat and I'm assuming he couldn't either, but that didn't stop us from communicating with our body language! Too awesome!

It's an amazing experience. I got so immersed in my game that I find myself leaning over the table, barely able to reach the cue ball, just to get a shot in. The table isn't there, of course, and I could just walk through the table to easily shoot. But because I felt like I was in a bar, and I felt like I was playing pool in real life, I found myself leaning. It's great.

The game is very nice, graphically. The sound is good, with the thuds and scratches of the pool balls sounding realistic. There are jukeboxes in the bar, but there isn't a whole lot of song selections. I didn't mess with it myself, so there may be more options available than I'm not aware of.

As far as the gameplay is concerned, it feels very fluid, and the controls are fairly simple to learn. Having to aim both the cue ball and where you're going to strike the cue ball itself is a little tricky, I've found, but that's more of a player being bad kind of thing and not the games fault. There's single player, with multiple levels of difficulty to choose from, and multiplayer. I've played a few games of multiplayer, and it was a great experience. There were no hitches, both of us moved fluidly, and the voice chat worked flawlessly.

I did experience a few bugs, though, such as the game telling me I was supposed to hit the solid balls, but then calling a foul on me for hitting the wrong balls (I was actually stripes). A few times the game called a foul on me for scratching the cue ball (hitting it into the pocket) when I didn't. But these experiences only happened one time each, and I feel that they'll be fixed soon.

I cannot recommend this game enough. If you're not a fan of pool, then the novelty of being in a bar, throwing objects around and playing darts isn't going to last you long enough to justify buying the product. But if you are a fan, or even if you don't really like or dislike pool, you should get this.

My only complaints are the fact that the dart board is apperiently not synced with the other player and lining up your queue with the white ball and simultaniously lining up the white ball with whatever you're trying to actually hit can be a bit tricky, if we could lock the queue on both hands individually rather than on both hands at the same time this would be easier.

If you have a small-ish VR space like I do, this game will definitely make you wish for larger space so you don't have to teleport for every shot.

But, its just pool. There's no crazy game modes or anything.  This isn't a complaint, but its important to know this game is faithful to real pool rules and  a high level of pool simulation.  Personally, I find it very relaxing, but I can see how others might find it boring after a while.  I have read the devs want to add more mini games. Currently you can play darts in the virtual pool hall. I guess we'll see when that stuff comes out and how it affects the game.

Minor critiques

I wish you could play an actual game of darts, from my quick experience it seems the score resets after every three darts.

I can't seem to figure out how to put a player name in the box. I don't wanna be ""player""!! 

Optimization. On medium settings I run 90fps, high 45ish fps, and ultra 30ish fps. I'm running an I7, 32g ram and 980ti SLI on an Asus Rock MB. Now I realize that VR doesn't utilize SLI, but I still feel like I should get higher than  30 fps on the ultra settings. Maybe I'm wrong here. At any rate, I list this as a critique and not a complaint because it looks fine and runs superbly awesome on the medium settings.

There's a ton of other stuff in the bar to grab and toss and interact with. You can even play darts and it'll track your score for you, which is pretty cool.

It is pool, pure and simple. I enjoy pool in real life, but in VR you have to advantage of always finding opponents to play with and you don't have to insert money for every game like in a pub 
It provides AI opponents for challenge, but the most fun lies in multiplayer
It's a very social expereiecne playing 1v1 match making. VR makes multiplayer gaming much more social and authentic. Add that to an already social pub game and you have a smash hit that you can play for hours 

Also, somthing cool you can do is, if you have a table nearby, is adjust the virtual table in game to the hight of the real life table for added authenticity. Just a cool touch that shows the polish

I got my Vive a few days ago, and after seeing this on sale I decided to buy it, it isn't pricey and  for sure worth it.

After playing about an hour, all I can say, that this game is amazing with a VIVE. Forget all other games, you'll only need this one to truly into VR. It feels like the real thing, Controls are very well done, graphics are great, a bit demanding though. Im running on a 980ti with a 4790k and have to set the graphics to medium or high. Medium is fine, High stutters somewhat, Ultra isn't usable with about 40 frames per second. I would apprecciate if the developers could tweak the engine somewhat more, because it look awsome in ultra and the immersion it the best I've ever seen on my Vive (or even the Rift)

This game is a masterpiece for Roomscale VR, it's a must have. I won't say it's a system seller, as pool isn't for everyone, but it's very near that.

I feel so much like in a bar playing pool billard, that I often tried to lean on the table, be carefull, you'll fall over onto your nose ;)

Sound is good, physics seem very realistic, though the AI is a little bit too good, even at lowest setting it's very hard to beat them.

Haven't tried multiplayer yet, I'm satisfied with singleplayer until now. Maybe I'll try multiplayer later, but I hate starting a game and then having to leave it because of real world things, same for the oppenent.

23354776,english,"This is a killer app for VR, for sure.

I grew up with a pool table in our basement, but it's been covered in laundry and laundry baskets for over a decade. I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.

If you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like ""That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR."" And now it's out, and yes. It is.

Yeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.

In 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger ""locks"" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.

You can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to ""pull"" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)

You're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.

The first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.

That was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)

As of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity — a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time. 

Oh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.

As far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.

The person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.

Anyway, get this game.

23354762,english,"TLDR: If you enjoy pool and own a vive buy this.

What an incredible experience Pool Nation VR is. 
I am running an old i5-2500k and a nvidia 970 for reference.
The graphics in this game are top notch. You spawn into a bar with weird npcs silently dancing/shuffling in the corner, TVs showing ads for a pool game, a jukebox, dartboard, and of course the pool table. 
The default quality setting of medium did not allow me to hit 90 fps so the reprojection was kicking in and fps was 45. Turning the quality to low, while sacrificing some visual fidelity, allowed my system to consistently hit 90 fps with a minor hit to graphics. 
The main attraction for this game is the multiplayer. 
After starting a game and getting someone to join it becomes a very interesting social experiment. I have played with many people, the vast majority either have their mic muted or have not figured out how to setup the vive mic. Others speak languages that I have no clue what they are saying. A handful have actually spoken Enligsh (I am a stupid American and don't know many languages) and that is where the majority of the enjoyment from this title has come from for me. Playing with a random person, talking as if we were in the same room and playing pool. It is an incredible sense of presence for me and really makes me feel like this random person is in my room. 
This is where some caveats come: this is the internet and people are not generally known for demonstrating common sense or respect for anonymous people who they will never see in real life. This can lead to people messing with you, some do it aggressively with spamming beer bottles, smashing lights, or the destruction that is the jukebox.
The majority of the people I have met have been cool dudes that are as impressed with the game as I am and just want to play a game of pool.
I strongly encourage players of this game setting up a real life table to lean against and steady shots on. This helps IMMENSELY (use the arrow keys on the keyboard when you are in game to change the height of the table to match yours). 
If you have a vive I recommend you give Pool Nation VR a shot. I am terrible at pool in real life (sort of) but with ghost balls (cheating, sue me) it makes the game a lot easier and it allows you to have fun with people a world away. 
Last note: The 'hulk mode' reorientation/locomotion was extremely disorienting and disconcerting for me when I began to play it, this has largely gone away and I have acquired stronger VR legs throughout the games.

23349841,english,"Pool Nation VR works very well. Controls wise, you hold the cue using the two touch controllers and the game feedbacks via red dot and ghost where you're gonna strike the white and where the white will strike the first ball. When you have the cue in position you pull a trigger which locks the cue, you then pull back with one hand and push forward to play the shot. While locked there is some minor adjustment available using the other trigger. Its not a simulation but its very approachable and fun.

Your opponent's headset and controllers are visible as a ghost of the equipment which is neat. You can customise yourself with a hat.

Also in the bar you can play darts but this is nowhere near so well thought out and polished. Almost impossible to judge aim and strength. May be with some practice but there are no assistances here.

The bar looks good and is fun to explore. Managed a steady 45 fps (half of ninety I assume) on high settings from my GTX 970. Most striking difference between high and medium being reflections on the floor. The game feeds back your fps when adjusting settings, nice one!

23348803,english,"TL;DR-This game is my favorite multiplayer experience and is the only game so far to make me forget I'm wearing a headset.

I've seen a few threads about it already, but I wanted to make my own in hopes of persuading anyone still on the fence about it. The more people in multiplayer, the better.

I loaded up the game not expecting much. It's a billiards simulator, how great could it be? Luckily, it was not what I was expecting, as I was smiling pretty much the whole time. The billiards hall is pretty big and you can teleport almost everywhere. The hall itself has more activities than pool, such as darts, dominoes, and breaking bottles. You could also try flirting with some of the ai's, but I guess I wasn't their type, as they just ignored me.

After messing around with the various activities scattered about the hall, I decided to dive into the meat of things, the billiards table. Due to haptic feedback, hitting the cue ball feels great and breaking is just as satisfying as in real life. Walking around the table felt so natural! You can teleport to any part of the tale by clicking the edge or, by using your side triggers, you can push and pull your play space. Luckily, my play space is 4mx3m, so once I had the table centered, I could walk all around it without having to worry about my chaperone bounds. This greatly added to my immersion. At one point I actually began to lean on the table while taking a break, but caught myself before I fell. This is the first game that's made me forget I was wearing a headset.

Once I got comfortable with the table controls, I decided to hop online. It was late here in California, so I wasn't sure if anyone else would be online. I joined an empty room and went back to messing around with bottles and chairs. After a few minutes I hear a noise behind me. ""Hey man, what's up?"" I turn around and there's a pair of floating controllers and a vive headset. I wave at him and he waves back at me. ""Here, have a drink!"" I reply, as I place one of the bottles I had spawned in front of him. We both laugh and start shooting some pool. I talk to him while we play and it turns out he's from New York and just like me, he's been staying up very late ever since getting his Vive. Halfway though the game we start messing around with putting bottles and chairs on the table. It doesn't affect the balls, but the balls will push the furniture around, so it's pretty entertaining to see. At some point I see my opponent wander over to one of the dart board. I follow him and we play a few round of darts, after which we go back to the table and finish our game. I won, we said good game, and with that, he waved and vanished.

This whole thing was such a great experience. It really feels like your playing with someone in the same room. I can't wait to play some more and get some unlockables. All in all, Pool Nations VR was such an awesome experience. It's definitely a game I'll be adding to my Vive demos when people are over.",76561198081783392,64,1,134,0,36,1472708848,1464892579,1464892579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

23346381,english,"Initial thoughts from Vive owner, and old-school 9-ball tourney player.

Environment: Very immersive environment, I initially forgot about Chapperone and tried walking around the table as though it were real. It was nice to sidle up to the bar and pretend to order a drink, and throw bottles around. The sound effects from the bar get repeitive, and the AI ""extras"" just repeat the same motions, but they're not meant to be the focus of the game.  I do like that you can wander around the bar and find a few quiet spots, but there's little else to explore.
I'm 6'1"" tall, and all the AI extras seemed like they were 5'0"".  This, combined with how ""low"" the tables feel, it seems there may be a slight scaling issue.  It would be nice to adjust player height, or be able to adjust vertically with the grip movement.

Interface: The controls were very good and responsive, and once you understand them they feel natural and intuitive.  I am especially a fan of using the grips to move the table around the user - this let me line up shots naturally as I normally would, as well as let me stand in the middle of the table so I didn't have to reach too far into cyberspace that I'd fall over IRL.  The grips felt like using ""wheelchair"" mode, and was by far the best-designed part of the game.
I was a little disappointed with the ""fine tuning"" aiming helper - it definitely helps line up shots, but seems to have the same sensitivity as normal shots (only it locks one hand).  But this is a minor issue.

Game/Physics:  This is the #1 most important issue for hardcore pool players when evaluating a pool game.  The physics are ""okay"" - it's no Virtual Pool 4.  Cue-english seems to work somewhat, though the table feels slippery, so english doesn't affect it as much as expected.  The pockets on the tables feel very sloppy, at times too tight, at times too wide.  Ball contact angles are pretty solid, so after some mental adjustment you get the feel of how the game wants to be played.
For other objects, physics seems janky - beer caps and dice barely bounce at all, while bar chairs will bounce all over the place.  I'm not a dart player, but I felt like I could get to learn the proper throws for darts.

Overall:  If you're into billiards/pool, you'll have a good time.  There are only a few game modes, doesn't seem like you can choose different tables or environments, so it's a pretty limited experience yet.  I haven't had a chance to try MP, but unless networking code is wacked out it should feel similar to playing the AI.  If you're looking for deep career-mode style pool with ladders and locales, it's not here.  If you're not into pool much you may need to pass, because throwing things around a bar at short people who don't respond to you gets old pretty quick.

ビリヤードの基本フォームは結構トラッキングに厳しい。
特に利き手は、ベースステーション(Light House)から隠れてしまいがち。
ベースステーションの設置を見直すのが一番見良いけど両方のコントローラのグリップボタンを握ってテーブル(空間)をヨイショと移動（回転）させてトラッキングさせやすい状況を作るのが良さ気。

ネットで対人戦をしていると皆さん平泳ぎで移動されています。（笑）
基本的にテレポート機能よりも両方のコントローラのグリップボタンを握って場面全体を回転させたり前後左右にずらすと楽にプレイできます。

AI対戦では負けても経験値は増えます。

設定項目にグラフィックがあります。Low/Mid/High/Ultraの４段階。
設定項目のところに現在のFPSが表示されるナイスアイデア。
GTX970だと一番低いLowで90fpsになりました。Midでもプレイに支障はないです。

游戏不需要什么英语能力，摸索两下就知道了。首先我第一次上手完全不知道怎么操作，玩起来并不是很顺手，练习了一杆后感觉还可以。刚开始玩就遇见一个神奇的bug，拿起杆，然后松手，杆子掉地上找不到了，不翼而飞……，接着打着打着突然间手柄就锁在桌子上了，怎么退都退不出去……可能是因为房间小，手柄碰到了边界，卡住了。

接着玩，发现除了可以打白球，其他球都打不了，可能我不会操作？还有周围的人好奇怪，模型有点粗糙，动作完全一致，就像跳广场舞。并且最神奇的是你可以把头深入他的身体，很神奇，还可以看到她的头。

周围全是啤酒瓶子，没有一个有啤酒的……可能流体特效难做吧。还有打球的手柄反馈感觉不错，但是物理特效有的时候很奇怪，球滚起来一顿一顿的，可能是我970的配置不够吧。当然并不严重……

Autre point positif, le multijoueur ! Comme dans AltspaceVR, on voit et on peut jouer avec d'autres personnes. On voit la position de leur casque ainsi que leurs manettes, ça rajoute à l'immersion en VR une convivialité assez incroyable, c'est fun, on prend beaucoup de plaisir et on partage vraiment un billard avec un ami.

23343943,english,"This is the best VR experience hands down!  Pool physics are right on!  I do, however have a few suggestions that I think would make the game better:

Absolutely Needed:
----------------------------
1) Implement varying rulesets, or allow customization of the rules (ie: in US 8-ball, non-break fouls result in ball-in-hand only behind the head string, and the target must be on the opposite side of the head string)

2) The ""locking"" system really needs to use both triggers.  The trigger on the bridge hand should lock in the contact point on the cue ball, but leave the grip hand free to adjust the shooting angle without losing your desired contact point on the cue ball.  The trigger on the grip hand should lock in the shooting angle.

""Nice To Have""
-----------------------------
1) Make the ""dummies"" more reactive to what's going on around them.  Make them duck or yell ""ow"" or something if you throw objects at them.  

2) I haven't checked to see if this exists, but the ability to import your own music or load an internet radio stream into the jukebox would be nice.

3) Darts is kinda weird-feeling, not the fault of the developers, but rather the difference between how you hold a dart vs how you hold the Vive controllers.  Maybe add something else like Air Hockey or Foosball?

4) Implement Cutthroat (a 3-player pool game)",76561198007299178,109,3,221,0,101,1499627213,1464873564,1464873662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I saw that you could pair up with others online and play I thought it would be fun, I wasn't dissapointed!

The graphics are really really good, it's not too blurry as a lot of VR games can be with the current generation of hardware. At times it can be difficult to tell if a ball is stripe or solid when it's far away, it's not a big deal to just move your head in a bit closer and have a look. The physics of the pool table are about as good as they can be!

I usually complain about everything but I don't really have much to say here. All I can think of would be a couple of feature additions such as the ability to change the way you look in game, maybe the option to use your own music on the juke box, and maybe to join games as a spectator (just hang out off to the side of a game). It would also be nice if they made it so you couldn't actually move yoruself over the top of the pool table. I don't really see how they could do that so I guess that's why they didn't do it lol.

- Controls are slick and easy to grasp.
- Physics are great, though I couldn't get a masse to work.  Basic english on shots work fine.

Cons:

- Performance is a little iffy, (GTX 970 and an 8-core I7) I ran on medium settings and had solid 60fps.  No motion sickness for me.
- I couldn't figure out matchmaking options, but I can probably do it with more tinkering.

23339450,english,"Pool VR is the best game for the Vive at the moment, its the only game that does not feel like a tech demo. I have only played alone (not even a match against AI) and the first thing I tried out was the physics of hitting balls and I was little disappointed I could not put a spin on the white ball and have it bounce of the walls in different angles, however when I turned of some settings to help you aim, spinning the ball got enabled and I could hit the ball exactly like I do in real life and it was a amazing feeling how well it is translated into the game.

This game is great I can only recommend it to anyone who has any interest in Pool

Pros+
+Complete pool experience
+Great physics
+Feels like playing the real thing (have a pool table at work) once you get used to the controls I got used to it after 1-2 games
+Great environment and ambient sound that really takes you away from your room and into a bar.
+Progression and unlocks

CONS-
-Not a lot of settings, you can't tweak what happens between different graphics sets (low, medium, high, ultra) 
also not a lot of sound options
For some reason my framerate was locked to 45fps but I will investigate, I am not sure its the game that locks it there.
-No sound when balls hit the walls on the pool table, I am expecting a  low *thump* sound when the ball hits the soft table cloth wall but it is not there for me. (especially the white ball)

This is a reminder that I have not even played multiplayer or against AI yet and I am expecting my impression of the game to get even better!

Can't wait for some new features like being able to choose your own music (or play from spotify/AM/???). The darts could use a bit of an overhaul, maybe it's own menu and proper scorekeeping.

- Teleport, snap-to-table-edge teleport, AND wand-based positioning
- Efforts to support a physical table in the play area (though completely optional)

- Scale feels a little bit small to me.  NPCs are all about 5'2"".
- Ability to turn off NPCs and misc. throwable objects to save performance.
- More environment choices (with less ray-inducing neon), including a VERY basic environment for performance.

- Winning spawns presents that give you unlockables... it is the MOST satisfying thing
- The controls, to me, are some of the best implemented in a game for world manipulation, the grip controls are the greatest thing in this game!
- Using the cue and the aiming system is great, however I wish there was a height adjustment. Being a little taller(6\'1) I find I have to almost squat to line a shot up. But man...it\'s too cool when you sink something you meant to

- There\'s darts in the game. Not the easiest to play but still very satisfying when you hit the board haha

- Control the music with your own music library, including shared tunes across streams
- Varied environments and perhaps even a few story modes where you play in front of crowds and have rival VR bots
- Branch out to Snooker and trick shots

23332914,english,"Awesome. Awesome.

Firstly, the pool game itself is very good. It’s intuitive and slick, and the whole environment looks great. You can also play darts, but I found this to be fairly tricky. I’m sure it could be mastered with a bit of practice though.

But that’s not where the appeal of this game really lies. It’s an insight into just how social strapping a brick to your head, in a dark room, on your own can actually be. Until now, fun as it may be, VR has been a pretty lonely experience in most games, but Pool Nation VR changes that.

The multiplayer mode is hilarious. Even though your opponent only appears as goggles and controllers-for-hands, their realistic movements really do give you the sense that you’re actually in the room with someone. Once you have a buddy to share the space with, the pool almost becomes secondary because there are so many other amusing ways to entertain yourselves. Virtually everything in the room can be interacted with, and the physics are pretty spot on.

Bearing in mind that it’s this much fun with total strangers, I can’t wait until VR is more commonplace and my mates and I can have virtual get-togethers, presumably on a more regular basis than is feasible to arrange in real life. I’m thinking poker games etc.

In the games I played against numerous opponents, neither of us spoke much. I put this down to the poor quality of the microphone in the Vive, and the fact that it was late at night and the rest of my family were fast asleep. Instead, all you can hear (aside from the background pub noise and the music) is the pair of you rapidly descending into uncontrollable fits of childish giggles. I could actually see them physically bent over double, as was I! Almost every time I played a shot, I’d look up and see the other guy doing something comical, and vice-versa. I was crying with laughter for most of the time, more so than I’ve done in ages. We tended to use gestures to show, for example, frustration at missing a shot or an outrageous fluke, rather than saying things out loud.

It was all the more entertaining because this was on the day of release, so you could see that everyone was still figuring it out and were awestruck by the novelty of it all.

Technically this game excels too. The textures look great, and it’s the only game I’ve seen that manages to make the resolution of the screens look several times greater than they actually are and as they appears in other titles.

My only complaints thus far are:

•	I’d like to be able to adjust the position of my grip hand on the butt of the cue. The reason being is because, by default, it’s quite far forwards and I can see no way of changing it. This means you’re hitting your body with the controller as you stroke the cue back and forth. In real life my hand would be further behind me.
•	Sidespin doesn’t seem to take any affect when the ball bounces off a cushion, and I can’t appear to get the ball to swerve. Maybe I just need more practice.
-       The background sounds are on a loop of a few minutes, and every so often you hear some bloke banging on about 'Tuesday night, Tuesday night'. If it weren't for him you probably wouldn't notice it looping. It just breaks the immersion slightly.

Some suggestions and wishes:

•	Multiple players (as in more than two), and/or spectators. It would just add to the atmosphere and hilarity. You’d probably need to be able to set up an exclusion zone around your table though to stop dickheads trying to ruin your games. Either that or a vote-to-kick or some sort of block system.
•	Access to your own music library. It would be cool if it could be displayed and selected using the jukebox in the room. I could create a playlist and then anyone could choose songs from it to queue up.
•	I’m sure there’s a technical term for this, but it makes things so much more realistic when objects resist each other. E.g. at Present, I can grab a bottle and wave it through other objects. In Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, for example, the physics are just a little better in this way.
•	Following on from the point above, I shouldn’t be able to play a shot where my cue is intersecting another object – a ball in front or the cushion of the table etc.
•	When positioning your head within a solid object, such as a wall or the pool table, the sound and vision should go blurry, like in Call of the Starseed.
•	Be able to write messages – maybe on a board so you can hold it up to the intended recipient (assuming more participants are allowed in later releases). Could either type text or scrawl it with chalk or the like. Maybe have a set of predefined sentences and/or be able to define your own (‘good shot’, ‘you fluky twat’ etc.). This goes back to what I was saying earlier about not being able to talk if the rest of your household are asleep or whatever.
•	Beer to flow from the bottles and bar taps.
-       Mirrors on the wall so you can see yourself also.
•	Change the TV channels, or even play music videos from your library.
•	More environments.
•	Be able to create and share new environments, tables, people, cues etc.
•	Be able to create, style and position bystander avatars.
•	Be able to control lighting levels etc.
•	Be able to control ambient noise and music levels.
•	Have a full head visible instead of just the VR goggles and hats. Could even have facial expressions to select from. Could be amusing.
•	Hands visible in the game instead of controllers? You could then have hand gestures like in Hover Junkers.
•	Miscues if you hit the ball at an acute angle and/or haven’t chalked your cue (need to be able to chalk the cue!).
•	More game types/rules. English pub rules. Red and yellow. Two shots upon fouling etc. Display the rules somewhere.
•	Snooker option.
•	Replays. Slow-motion etc.
•	Pocket tightness adjustment.
•	Table speed adjustment.
•	The potted balls to show up in the clear slot on the side of the table like in real life.
•	Room scale and height adjuster.
•	Adjust the scale of the people in the room. Everyone seems a bit small, which is fine for the girls, but the guys look a tad out of proportion.
•	The bystanders to walk around instead of just dancing and chatting on the spot.

Until now, Audioshield was my favourite (followed by Project Cars), but Pool Nation VR now easily takes that crown by a loooong way.

I already had high hopes/expectations for the future potential of VR hardware and apps, but this definitely raises the bar and whets the appetite further. Lest we forget we’re only a few months into this whole VR adventure (proper), and if we’re already achieving this then it bodes extremely well.

Props to the devs.

This is the future!

23332104,english,"First off, this is a great pool game. Physics as well as hit detection is just perfect.

I only have about 40 mins to 1 hour invested so far but that time passed by in what felt like a split second.

So far I've only fooled around a bit in the environment and played the AI a couple of times.

It's probably just me (sucks at pool) but the AI has bested me every time, and since it's the easiest difficulty it should be a little easier. 
Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge, but since there's about 10-15 difficulty settings the easiest one should be a cakewalk. That way it would be both a casual game that caters everyone, but they seem to be aiming for the hardcore pool enthusiasts.

Pros:
   Great physics
   Awesome graphics
   Truly immersive 
   Priceworthy

Cons:
   AI a little too good (like I mentioned, probably just me)
  Dart physics are a bit off at the moment 
   For some objects the SFX sometimes doesn't play

Conclusion
A hell of a game that's more or less free.
There are some minor caveats, but they're all patchable.

Improvements
Please oh please add multiplayer hubs for about 15-20 players so you can just hang out by the sofas and chat, walk around and spectate tables etc. That would be EPIC!",76561197961418392,151,1,272,0,83,1488117099,1464807811,1464808021,True,29,5,0.751057088375091553,0,True,False,False
23332031,english,"[after 30 minutes]
I've only had 30 minutes to play, but first impression is very positive. Graphics are great. Controls are great. Presence is great. There's a good teleportation system--I was able to play just fine with about 4 square meters of space.

You can move the whole room around to get a good angle, and it's not very nausea-inducing if you look at the table while doing it. There's a grid that appears around you while moving the room, which stays stationary and keeps you feeling anchored in space.

It's a bit weird to line up your shot when you can't rest your hand on the table, but you can lock it in place so you don\'t have to worry about holding it still while you follow through.

It felt more natural than any computer pool game I've ever played. I even found it easier to line up my shots when the ""ghost ball"" aiming aid was turned off.

[after 90 minutes]
Still really impressed. The resolution of the Vive is a noticeable limitation on long shots. I ended up using the back of a recliner as stand-in for the table itself. With a steady bridge hand I started making shots much more often.

The atmosphere is tuned really well. There's movement and noise around you enough to make you feel like you're in a bar. I would say it's like a pool hall, but the only pool noises are the ones at your table. But the atmosphere is never so loud or animated that it distracts you. They clearly put a lot of work into the setting and it paid off.

I have not had jutter playing on medium quality. High was manageable, but not smooth enough for extended play in comfort. i7 6700k w/ R9 Fury",76561197979113628,400,5,104,0,104,1465061955,1464807604,1464823995,True,3,0,0.513382017612457275,0,True,False,False
23332005,english,"This game is an absolute perfect fit for VR, with intuitive controls and an accurate physics model this is a must buy for anyone interested in pool or snooker. I played throughout the Beta of this game and the devs made constant tweaks and updates during it\'s development which is a really positive sign. 

In the last update they enabled proper spin/english on the cue ball so it follows natural paths off cushions along with an easy to use height adjustment hotkey. This enables players to use a real life table to lean on when taking shots just like real pool, this increases emmersion and comfort during play. There is an option to use a ghost ball if you just want to play casually but I prefer the realistic feel of playing snooker/pool at home with the guides and aids turned off.

This game is multiplayer online and I would say this is probably one of the very best experiences currently available for virtual reality so far. I have made some videos on YouTube and recently included a brief review of this last update, just search Falandorn on YouTube and click my uploaded videos.

With all the current options it is just impossible not to love this game and they are looking to keep developing it in future too. Wholeheartedly recommended!

Do understand I basically have 15-20 minutes play time but if anything wanted to get a review posted for others to see. I played a game against the AI and top notch and love the ability to play pool in VR versus looking at a 2d screen.

Ball physics and collisioning seem to be spot on. 

If I found anything negative and if anything I fault myself is the fact that even on Medium Graphics, I was getting the room studder and that shaky camera feeling that causes motion sickness. I run with a GTX 970 so I do need  a newer graphics card which I do plan to pick up the GTX 1080. I did crank the graphics to Ultra and looks great but can\'t play because of my card and the shakiness.

If you like pool, you are lucky. This game is almost like playing pool in real life.
Everything that surround the game itself, makes you feel like you are in a real pool bar.
The way you get the cue to use it, it just feel so cool.

It has many little details, to play arround
Also has a good progression with unlockeable items and many different AI Levels.
The fact that you can play against other players online is a plus plus.

The Teleport to just one side of the table in stead of doing it to the floor is just great.
Very Well done Game Design !!

The controls are a bit strange at the begining but once you learn it, it became very easy to use.
Just to mention the controls sometimes doesn\'t work properly and the one for the darts, that need to be polish.

So yes, I am very surpirse for this game.
