110655827,english,"It's rather nice looking, you can feel some artist's pawprint in the skeletons with prognathic jaws or tiny archers hiding in oversized helmets. The gameplay is ok. You have to hit the enemies in their unarmored bits, and while they're not very quick, it's still a challenge in VR. There's the expected sword, shield, bow, further in the game you can also buy a two handed axe or a better sword. There is no spell casting, but near the end you get a magic wand. Levitating mages, and archers in unreachable spots, do force you to switch away from melee. There's the usual breaking of pots to find rupees, and some hand climbing on hanging chains, as in other VR titles, to reach secrets. The cover picture is a bit misleading, as nothing is even in this style in the game. Though you sport the exact same weapon set as that person. Also, I don't know who copied who, or if it even comes from a third game, but the ore mining is eerily similar to the one in Vengeful Rites, reviewed above.

My biggest issue with this game and the reason I am thumbing down is that it is way too short. It feels like there's only one level! And then a second level which is only a single arena room, with a handful of waves. I know VR games are usually shorter than flat games, but at 3hr long this is really stretching too much. Or too little, rather.

Данжи узкие, пройти мимо противника нет возможности. Потому приходится бить всех подряд. Это не сложно, ведь мозгов у врага мало и он нападает по одному.

105355733,russian,"Игра после запуска которой захотелось сделать рефаунд но  в последствии она приятно удивила. В первые минуты игра показалась сильно устаревшей (что неудивительно в ранний доступ она вышла 5 лет назад), но буквально спустя 30 минут я увлеченно искал ключи и решал несложные пазлы, и радовался приятной боевке.

В большой плюс хочется записать разнообразие оружия - мечи, молоты, метательные топоры, лук, копье, двуручное оружие, есть и уникальный метательный молот - оммаж на молот Тора который возвращается в руку после броска, и не теряет актуальности в бою на средней дистанции вплоть до финала игры несмотря на невысокий урон.

Кажется именно этой игрой вдохновлялись разработчики Karnage Chronicles и Shadow Legend VR, в Karnage Chronicles особенно много схожих элементов. 

Из очевидных минусов нет ориентации по шлему при движении стиком, только ориентация по контроллеру, что очень неудобно если учесть что обе руки в бою активно используются, а так же множество различных багов и кривой анимации и реализации многих видов оружия (например двуручное оружие использовать неудобно). 

Отдельно стоит отметить один фатальный баг в третьей главе, в этой главе правила игры меняются и при выходе из игры и последующем ее продолжении мы не возвращаемся на контрольную точку, а начинаем с хаба где оракул выдает нам квесты на сбор зачарованного меча (собранные части меча при этом остаются), так вот зачастую при попытке сдвинутся с места нас перебрасывает в совершенно другую локацию, в которой у игрока даже нет ключа чтобы открыть первые же врата, спасает перезапуск игры и быстрый телепорт ближе к оракулу  из этого забагованного места. Баг может успеть сработать даже в этом случае, может понадобится несколько перезапусков.

Еще есть нюанс что финального босса 3 главы можно победить только магическим уроном, а мана здесь реализована как расходуемые кристаллы, и если потратить часть из них до прихода к нему можно оказаться в ситуации что нанести урон боссу нечем. Для победы над финальным боссом нужно примерно 2000 маны (около 30 выстрелов зачарованным мечом, число отображается на нем). Тут так же может помочь перезапуск игры, который вернет вас на хаб и у вас останется то количество маны которое было в момент прохождения предыдущего квеста.",76561198068663012,184,4,457,0,457,1638797667,1638800623,1638800623,True,1,0,0.51530611515045166,0,True,False,False

Découvert chez un ami à l'époque où le jeu ne comptait qu'un seul chapitre, il m'avait laissé un très bon souvenir. Quelques années plus tard, après m'être équipé d'un casque VR à mon tour, je me suis décidé à l'acheter dans sa version complète et je n'ai pas regretté mon achat.
Certes nous sommes loin d'un Skyrim VR ou d'un Asgard's Wrath mais ce n'est pas le propos de ce jeu.
Simple dans ses mécaniques, dans ses graphismes, dans sa narration, il n'en demeure pas moins efficace.
Sorte de Zelda aux graphismes à la World of Warcraft, Vanishing Realms sait nous transporter dans son univers médiéval fantastique, nous faisant parcourir donjons, châteaux, mines et autres forêts armé de boucliers, d'arcs, d'épées, de marteaux, de haches et d'autres équipements.
Attention malgré tout, le jeu pourra paraître mécanique et répétitif dans son déroulement, il est dommage qu'aucun personnage non joueur parlant n'ait été prévu, ce qui aurait contribué à le rendre plus vivant.
A noter aussi un passage de combats en arène au chapitre 2 qui fait le lien entre la fin du premier et le début du troisième, et qui est clairement dispensable mais malheureusement obligatoire pour continuer. Mention spéciale aux chapitres suivants qui valaient, selon moi, l'attente qu'il ont suscités à l'époque.

Vanishing Realms то весьма захватывающая ролевая игра, которая разработана с нуля, специально для VR.
Сама по себе она достаточно простенькая,без замысловатых механик,но именно принадлежность к VR отыгрывается классно. Нам дают помахать мечом и другим оружием,пострелять из лука и волшебный жезл.
- Разнообразные враги
- Разнообразные локации
- Ловушки и простенькие головоломки

This was obviously a game designed in the birth of the VR era and suffers from the archaic control schemes everyone hates,  
The UI/UX is terrible. The movement options lack HMD direction movement option.  There is nothing more infuriating when playing a VR game is having the smooth motion option that is so slow that it forces you to use teleport just to keep you from going crazy.
Almost all VR controllers going forward are going to be utilizing similar control schemes.   Its time to stop using the trigger to grab objects.  It isn't natural and counter intuitive.

87537579,english,"Vanishing Realms seems like what a Zelda in VR could be. Exploration, combat, minor puzzles are well woven together in this short adventure (~4h with the DLC). Given the fact that _one_ person is responsible for this, it's a pretty impressive outlook what's achievable in VR.

Let's break it down:

- graphics: good, but comic
- sound: well designed, good use of silence and noises

- Exploration/leveldesign: The map is a good mix between overworld-thems and dungeons, which never bored me while my playthough. There are some (obvious) alcoves/niches/sideways which one can follow for some loot, food and mana-gems. All in all divers and fun to explore, although superficial

- Weapons: Swords, Hammers, a waraxe, Bows, a Wand (and a shield - which I didn't use at all) - straight forward. 
- Close combat: The combat system shines here - although the shield is completely negligible, as one can parry with the swords/hammer/axe aswell. The hitboxes are on point most of the times, although I sometimes got hit through my sword (could be due to missing tracking of my Rift S aswell). Enemies have their movesets /weakpoints which are easy to learn, but fighting them never gets boring. The variety of the enemies is good, but they're never a _tough_ challenge. 
- Bow: Well, it's a bow. It's accurate, fun, but pretty cheesy. :D
- Wand: This is the deal: Big AoE damage - for a high price. Better collect all the mana you can find. But shooting multiple foes with one blast is worth it.  

- Puzzles: Nothing difficult, but still enjoyable

Conclusion: This game is an enjoyable adventure (especially for younger folks), which drives you to explore, learning the combatsystem and maybe even a 2nd playthrough. It's a well rounded mix of all adventure elements, resulting in a 4h long zelda-esque game - made by one person.",76561197998227733,94,3,170,0,170,1614356979,1614427192,1614427192,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Look, Vanishing Realms isn't bad. It's just feels more dated than it should. Locomotion is imprecise to impossible, depending on your VR setup, and the world feels very limited and empty. The puzzles are pretty simple, the enemies are slow and dumb, and loot feels artificial and arbitrarily unlocked rather than earned. I honestly get why people enjoy it, but there are other games that do what it does better, and it's hard to recommend one that left me feeling disappointed.

That said, if this game is really your thing, and you've played through the other VR RPGs, you might enjoy this one. If Steam allowed a middling recommendation, I'd give it here. There are some neat puzzles, and the combat, while not terribly unique or varied, is fun enough to keep you swinging. But if you're on the fence, shop around a bit.

77958217,english,"Vanishing Realms is a really good low cost ""RPG Style"" Single player VR game. Works quite well on my PC which is a bit lower end for VR.(Radeon R7 370). It is actually one of my favourites so far. I hope the developers add more levels. Currently there are two. The story is your a Hero fighting monsters. There is a bit of story in-game basically to tell you what you need to do. Thats all, short and simple. But its great for this game.

Graphics are block style like the kind used in world of warcraft. Personally this is good thing if it lightens load on GPU and allows smother performance. I don't think ultra real graphics are required for VR immersion. More important is how characters interact. Block graphics are not a hindrance for this game in my view

Content/story: Short. One chapter can be completed in a day, or perhaps half day if your skilled enough. There is one goal in mind and the path is set for you - no open world.
AI is fairly basic. Attack patterns are repetitive and each monster spawns once in one one place only. There are no ""friendly"" characters to chat with. Just Follow the path to the end killing monsters and collecting keys along the way to open doors. There is a ""Boss"" monster at the end.

For the time it was released, I'm sure it was fantastic, but $20 today will get you much more. This is a lot like a one-player version of Karnage Chronicles -- if you have that, no real need to get this one. You explore a very little, gather gold and occasionally some items to solve a puzzle. Most things are pretty straightforward: to unlock the door in front of you, look in the very next room somewhere to the left or right and find a key.  That's fine.  I think with the teleport movement (which is still wonky and doesn't always work), I would get annoyed with lengthy searches just to unlock a door. Combat is mostly swinging wildly at mostly stationary mobs that will telegraph their incoming blows so you can parry, shield block or riposte. Pick up some treasure for your efforts, hack some barrels or urns with your sword for some copper, mine with a pickaxe for some gold or mana crystals, search for some ""lost"" red chalices (again, in plain sight). Point is, there's not a whole lot here, ultimately.  And when you are forced to use a bow, the game can be pretty frustrating, especially if you've played a more recent game like In Death Unchained, which has very fluid and realistic -- or at least more predictable -- physics.  Vanishing Realm's bow is more like a floaty toy that seems weightless and when you grab the arrow to draw it back, you don't always end up with it.

72661030,english,"The game feels very barebones, and definitely doesn't feel like it's worth the price. I was aware that it was short before I bought it; what I wasn't aware of was how disappointed I'd be by the gameplay - disappointed enough to not even get to the purportedly early-arriving ending.

Now, I am aware that this was a pretty early VR game, because I remember seeing it featured in a PeanutButterGamer  video from years ago, but if we're appealing to the ""it was good for it's time"" argument, then I'm just going to say that it hasn't aged well at all in my opinion.
I can't quite put it into words, but everything about this game feels clunky and lazy - graphics, controls, gameplay, level design, animations... I'm not necessarily accusing the developers of lazyness - it could just as well have been lack of experience or a consequence of being a relatively early VR game. Still, that feeling was inescapable for me when playing, regardless of what caused it.

You can probably see that I played this game for less than an hour. I had been trying my hardest to enjoy the game until then, but at that point I realized that I didn't ever want to play it again.
Maybe the game gets really good later on. In that case, I half-rescind my criticism, as some of it doesn't apply to the whole game (although basic gameplay and graphics complaints probably aren't the kinds of things to change halfway through the game). However, the game went on in the way I described for long enough to get me to stop playing, so at the very least you should be warned about that. And, if what I've heard about the length of this game is true, then my complaints are quite likely to still apply for the whole game anyway.

I do have one thing to say that isn't necessarily negative though:
This game would probably be more enjoyable with a really big playspace. If you have enough space to actually walk around within the bounds of an in-game room, and freely dodge incoming projectiles, swords or swinging axes by physically moving without having to worry about jumping into a wall, drawer, or desk, then the immersion factor might, MIGHT be enough for me to recommend this game.
That is up to people with large playspaces to say though, and many of my complaints would still apply.",76561198324484050,262,14,27,0,27,1591133981,1594711797,1594711797,False,3,1,0.548237740993499756,0,False,False,False

物理演算が豪華なVRゲーを遊んだ経験があるとやっぱり見劣りしちゃうんだけど、そうでなければ特段つまんねぇからやるなってほどのゲームでもないのでサムズアップで。


本編だけなら4時間、DLCまでやっても6時間弱のボリュームで、そこそこ長いこと早期アクセスにいたせいで発売日のわりにはシステムがやや古めな印象。

戦闘では剣を振って敵の武器や防具に当たるとガキンと弾かれた音がして、1秒ほど自分の剣が半透明になり判定も消える。なので防御の上から攻撃するとプレイヤーの腕はすり抜けて敵の胴体を捉えているのに、その頃には剣から判定が消えているので当たらない、という処理をしている。

燕返しのような素早い切り返しの連撃を行ったところで一発目が盾に当たっていると二発目は判定が復活していないので無効になる。また地面スレスレの横薙ぎは防がれないはずだが、腰から下には喰らい判定がないのか絶対に当たらない。

そういった仕様を理解してシステム的に強い行動、例えば密着して脇腹を刺すようなムーブをするとヌルゲーになる上に、剣と盾で戦うヴァーチャル体験からどんどんかけ離れていくのはどうかと思う。DLCだとシールドバッシュで距離を離してくる敵もいて対策されてるが。


それとプレイ中の大部分はなんのBGMも鳴ってなかったり、剣を振っても効果を及ぼせるものに接触した時にしか反応がなく、壁や床はスカスカ抜けて手応えがなかったり、悪くないんだけどもう一歩感がつきまとうゲーム。素材に合わせた音を鳴らしてコントローラを振動させてくれるだけでいんだけどなあ。

I do not care for wave fights or wave shooters.

I also purchased Chapters 3 and 4 (DLC) as reviews indicate that the DLC is better that the base game.  Dev left a post on the discussion months ago that you can play the DLC without having completed Chapter 2 by finding a file called Hero located in the DLC.  Nope, I cannot locate this file along with a number of other players that are unable to locate the file.  I posted a note hoping that the Dev would respond and help me locate this file so i can play the DLC.  Currently, you cannot play the DLC unless you have completed Chapter 2...the arena wave fighter.  I have been unable to complete this Chapter and as such am unable to play the DLC.

What really bothers me is the lack of continued support on many VR games from the devs.  I can name at least a dozen VR games on Steam where devs have gone silent and do not provide any more support.  If devs stop supporting or are non-responsive to players; why does STEAM continue to keep the item on their store page...THIS IS why a lot of people are now hesitant to purchase games developed by INDIEs.

70751493,english,"I get what they're going for with the main melee combat - hold a sword, use it to hit opponents and deflect weapons. It doesn't work for 2 main reasons:
1. This game doesn't care how tall I am. I'm 6'2"" (188cm) and I'm too tall to deal with some attacks when I'm standing, and too short to deal with others when I'm kneeling. This would be absolutely no problem whatsoever, except...
2. Enemies only engage with you at extremely close range, thereby lowering their guard and making the combat-as-intended possible. Again, I think this is because they needed it to be playable for children with shorter limbs than I have, and it's not accommodating for my height. In this range, I really don't have the freedom to use the length of my weapon in order to help me deflect things, which means that if I can't reach low enough with my hand, I simply can't deflect a low attack.

This wouldn't be an issue if deflecting attacks worked like real sword fighting, where I can hold my sword at a shallow angle to deflect the opponent's momentum to pass harmlessly to my side, but this game works on ""hollywood / play-fighting"" rules, where it tends not to detect anything as a block unless my weapon is perpendicular to the opponent's, as if to directly meet the opponent's force with equal and opposite force. I normally never hold this kind of thing against a game (I have yet to see a VR game that supports cutting, in addition to chopping and stabbing), but in this case it does prevent me from working around the problem.

Played on a Valve Index.

Your weapons have no sense of weight, ranged weapons are very hard to aim (even the ones with an auto-aiming function like the hammer you can get in chapter 3), and for me generally fights boiled down to repeatedly thrusting at an enemy's weak point (for skeleton warriors, the right shoulder) around whatever armor they had until they died. Enemy AI is painfully simple, and often enemies won't even chase you down. They'll just stay in one place while you kill their allies one at a time. 

When you're not flailing around, the game is mostly a lot of walking from one dungeon environment to the next. There are puzzles every so often, but nothing that should challenge you unless instructions written in rhyme are hard for you to understand. There's a free locomotion option, but it appears the game wasn't designed around it - I kept getting stuck on random bits of terrain any time I moved off the path. 

The game also made an interesting design choice in that you have to *pay* for all the equipment you need to progress. Loot is scattered all over the dungeon, more than enough to buy all the essentials, and for me it was kind of fun to look into crannies or try to figure out how to reach out-of-the-way treasure. But I can't help but think this is a way to pad out a game that doesn't have much else going for it.

Most of my issues were with the controls. I could not turn the character with the thumbsticks. This is a problem when you have a wire coming out of your head and need to generally look around. I also very much don't like teleportation movement - I get that it's more comfortable until you get used to movement in VR (which may be easier for some than others), but it makes it harder to get where you actually want to be, especially if you have a small play area.  There were options in the menu that seemed to be related to movement, but I couldn't get them to change, so no idea what they do or if they were supposed to help.

The movement was annoying, but I was gonna try to put up with that because the environment seemed cool and I wanted to explore it. And I would have, but I quit after what steam tells me is 0.2 hours - half of which was spent trying to let go of a torch. 

I got to a second locked door with a torch in each hand, (two is better than one, right?) and a key hanging literally right next to the door on the wall. Cool, I'll walk over and grab it. ""You can only hold one item in that hand."" Fair enough, I'll put a torch in one of the belt bag things. Doesn't work. Apparently you have two belt pouches that can hold 1 item each? and mine were full. Ok, that's fine, I'll drop a torch. Click the drop button. ""Don't drop me!"" Try to drop the other torch. Same message. Cue literally every combination of buttons I can think of to get rid of this torch. Nothing happens. Try to smack it into things - nothing, though that made me drop one earlier somehow.

I'm not really sure how far I am into the game. I beat chapter 1, and chapter 2 (the eponymous ""Rite of Steel""). The game offered me Chapter 3, which I'll jump into later.

Still, lots of fun and highly recommended as a simple, solid, exploration and combat game. I do recommend a large space, particularly early on, as you'll want to walk around the environments and dodge about while fighting if you can.

GRAPHICS

The graphics are not particularly the best thing in this game, but they are rather good. Although very stylistic, it fits the old-style D&D type world. 1/2

Music/Sound Effects

The music in this game isn't anything special, but still very satisfying to listen to as it reminds you of an old fantasy setting. This game truly is a VR love-letter to a short D&D campaign. The sound effects by the creatures, such as the skeletons and mages, are very unique and sound great. 1/2

Storyline/Bugs

While playing the game, I didn't run into any bugs, but the game truly has no story. The game drops you into a dungeon and you venture outwards to kill the holy king of the dungeon. 1/2

Pacing

Pacing is extremely well-done in the first chapter of the game, as it has you go mining, fight unique creatures and bone giants. However, the pacing is ruined when you figure out that the second chapter is a glorified arena that I completed in one go (with the best sword in the game). 1.5/2

Gameplay/Length

Gameplay is fun and engaging as you are using a bow and arrow, a sword and shield, and even a magical fire staff. However, the length of this game is where it falls flat. For a 20 dollar VR game, I expect at least 4 hours of gameplay unless the game is truly groundbreaking. It is important to note that the game's first two chapters came out in the first years of VR, so it may have been the perfect price for a game like this. For me, this game took less than 2 hours to complete, while the majority of my time was spent in the first chapter (adventure) and I beat the second chapter in under 20 minutes due to it being a 9 stage arena. 1/2

This game is very short, but is a perfect game to present to new users of a VR system. I give this game a 5.5/10 (Average) and I must recommend it to new users of VR, as it is a fun and easy game to play.

CONS:
there's no turn in the game or any options menu for that matter. so even if you want your main locomotion controller to be your left, too bad. this game was excruciating to play. Ive been following this game for a really really long time, i was so looking forward to it just to find out that these essential vr mechanics are absent. I understand that it might be the feel or playstyle the game is going for but for me it was not fun and extremely difficult.

on top of that, combat.
combat in this game is really lacking i have NO IDEA how people are saying its great. literally the ps3 sports champions gladiator gamemode had better mechanics when it came to speed, weight, impact, better hit boxes in general, and a sense of danger. This game is something else. It's been addressed in other reviews im sure but man the combat feels really dull. It's a slow game with one enemy youre fighting at a time. 

one word of advice for this game, it needs music or a soundtrack or something, on top of the dull combat mechanics, theres nothing happening other than the distinct sound of steel against steel. the ambience and immersion is great, just add some music man, when im playing this game i start to feel like im all by myself.

54972127,english,"Both the game and the DLC Sunderer Rift are good products. The graphics is in a ""cartoon"" style, unrealistic, with good lighting effects that make the game both ""light"" and enjoyable. It is not a title filled with complex textures in high definition but it is nevertheless realized with good inspiration and imagination. The Audio is essential, with very few dialogues and a discreet amount of rhyme text, which remains a bit obscure for those who do not speak English well. Enemies and the few other NPCs are aesthetically good. The Interactions and the attacks are limited to few repetitive but not annoying combinations. The maps are well studied, sometimes short but more often with “nested” sublevels or with a chance to deepen and lengthen the game, if you want to discover all the little secrets. The game mechanics are simple but clean and well designed, with lots of fun weapons to use and an  inventory easy to manage.
The game itself, without the DLC, isn't long. The DLC is literally a new game, probably longer than the ""first chapter"". Someone complain that the new DLC is not free. In my opinion the developers have done a good job and have shown that they have not abandoned this title but rather, have developed a sort of interactive story, gradually enriching it. VR games unfortunately cannot count on a large audience. Small jewels like Vanishing Realm are rare and precious.

I hope that the developers will not abandon the work and guarantee to Vanishing Realms a constancy that can make it, in the end, a game ""AAA"", long, elaborate and loved.

Di base il gioco è molto carino, ma l'esperienza viene rovinata dal tentativo di svecchiare il prodotto con l'inserimento di meccaniche viste in giochi più moderni. Quindi per godere a pieno del gioco è meglio giocare con il sistema di base, il teleport.

Pro:
- atmosfere convincenti
- visivamente carino anche se pur minimal
- compartimento sonoro buono

Con:
- con gli index controller cascano di continuo gli oggetti dalle mani
- se si sceglie lo stick per il movimento al posto del teletrasporto vi incastrerete di continuo su scalini o negli spazi ridotti (problema che si presenta sin dal tutorial)
- sempre se si sceglie lo stick per il movimento, non è possibile scegliere cosa comanda nell'orientamento  del giocatore (se sulla posizione del controller o del visore) , quindi se si muove il controller in una qualsiasi direzione questo influenza la direzione scelta rendendo le azioni molto scomode, soprattutto nei combattimenti.
- quando raccogli le monete compare l'icona (dei soldi) che occlude la visuale.
- potete sventolare l'arma per colpire senza imprimere forza nei colpi tanto farete gli stessi danni.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- in conclusione: (personalmente) mi viene voglia di chiedere allo sviluppatore se sa come si crea un'interfaccia di gioco usabile.

54814502,english,"Chapter 1,2 and first hour and 15 minutes of chapter 3 here:  https://youtu.be/cDg1ZLQ8FCU

Well I was certainly excited to see the long awaited Chapter 3 of this VR classic finally here!  I unfortunately did not have a save file so had to play through the first 2 again, but it was like visiting an old Zelda game and brought back all the feels so I didn't mind.  I'm only an hour 15 min into the 3 chapter thus far and can't wait to play more.  It looks to be quite a bit bigger than the previous 2 chapters combined! Seriously I feel like chapter 3 is so much improved over the first 2, it should just be Vanishing Realms 2.

Graphics:  This is a title that really shows off the magic of Low poly graphics in VR.  Yes it's cartoony,. yes some textures can appear flat.  All of that aside it still gives the little kid in me the feels.  Chapter 3 really shines as well. I noticed right away that the sky box was much improved including moving slightly transparent clouds,. a bright moon without the distortion in the first  2 chapters.  The fire looked better,. the enemy models are much improved,. just def looks like an upgrade from before.  

Sound: The sound once again is great.  Great new music !  It doesn't always play which is nice.  Reminds me of playing Tomb Raider when all of a sudden you would walk into a big awe inspiring room and the beautiful music would hit and just give you chills.  The sounds of the swords clanking against each other and sliding across each other are perfect.  it just adds so much the combat that is still,. as far as what I've played,. one of the absolute best combat experiences in VR. 

Controls:  At first I didn't realize I had to turn around in the menu to turn on smooth locomotion.  it is there. it's behind you. haha.  I had tried that option before when it was first introduced and I didn't like it because it was so slow.  Now it's faster now,. but  still could be a little faster in my opinion.  Other than that it's the same control mechanics as before.  Simple and intuitive. 

Game play:  This chapter feels so great to play.  It's bigger, . much bigger from what I can tell.  there are more fun hazards to deal with, new, much harder enemies to fight, new weapons including a super fun throwing spear!  There are a few other additions that are just so fun but I don't want to spoil anything,. well unless you watch the video.   Vanishing Realms does right, what so many other VR games I play do not.  It really makes you use your play space.  You have to bend over to physically pick things up, instead of just force grabbing things,. you can easily walk around you play space to collect loot,. you just pick things up out of your inventory ,. it's a VR game!  No confusing menus that you have to try and scroll through taking you out of your experience.  It's an adventure done right!   I don't know how long this chapter is,. but I have an hour 15 in and only unlocked one of 5 objectives so I'm guessing it will not disappoint me.

Overall:  I cannot recommend this title enough!  It is a VR classic Adventure RPG as Zelda is to Nintendo.

VR content has come a long way since 2016 and some of that shows here but the dev has done a lot of work to update things and keep it up to the standard. The latest update works well with my Valve Index controllers and I really like the scheme for combining the trigger and grip for grab and hold.

The inventory system is still better then many newer VR games. It does look a bit clunky with the icons hovering around your waist but for the ease of use it's worth it.

The latest DLC situation bother me. People's expectations are a little unrealistic sometimes for these kinds of projects, This is a small dev and they never release content that isn't highly polished. The base game we got still blows away many other VR titles that cost as much or more. The reality of the situation is VR content is still a small niche and making VR games isn't cheap or easy.

Vanishing Realms is roughly a 3 hour long VR RPG, one that just left Early Access on August 23, 2019 and one that had been in development for a couple of years. This game went over a year without a single update. No word from the developer. Nothing. Unless the forums get cleansed, you can see where myself and others were asking if the project had been abandoned.

Then, lo and behold the developer pops up out of nowhere and says a huge new update is coming. Great! It's not dead! No further details, until it was dumped onto Steam behind a $17.49 CAD paywall and the game then abruptly pulled out of Early Access. It's clear the developer wanted nothing more to do with the project and just wanted to get it over with, so he yanked it out of EA with a last ditch effort cash grab.

There are other options to meet your VR RPG needs; OrbusVR, while expensive, is constantly getting new updates (including seasonal events) without locking things behind a paywall. There's also VR Dungeon Knight and Karnage Chronicles.

The early access game was more of a demo than anything, waited years for updates to come with a very silent developer which started to give doubts to the reality of this game being expanded further than what felt like a demo of a game.

Das Spiel ist zwar auf Englisch aber recht simple gemacht.

Positiv:

Story ist schön auch wenn das Spiel kurz ist.
Grafik ist OK.
Sound und Atmosphäre ist gut.
Die Gegner sind recht simple und die Kämpfe sind nicht hektisch so das man jederzeit sich wehren und zuschlagen kann.
Keine Motionsickness
Keine Bugs bzw keine gefunden

Negativ:

Hitbox beim Bogenschießen  ist etwas komisch da manche Pfeile einfach durchgehen und Streifschüsse zählen leider auch nicht.
Die Sicht vom Inventar verstellt sich meisten wenn man was ablegen oder nehmen möchte.
Trotz starker Grafikkarte (1080 Ti) hatte ich mal heftige Frames einbrüche gehabt weil ein paar Gegner zuschlagen wollten, war nicht störend aber der Moment war krass.

DLC:

Gut gelungen für ein paar Spiel stunden.
Inventar wurde verbessert (ich denke da kam davor ein Update).
Neue Waffen und Bogen.
Story mäßig abwechslungsreich.

48336597,german,"[h1]So muss Action-VR sein[/h1]

Als ich mir die Oculus Rift gekauft hab, hatte ich genau solche Spiele im Sinn. 
Vanishing Realms ist ein Action-Adventure mit Ähnlichkeiten zu Skyrim. Im Fokus steht Schwertkampf, Bogenschießen und das Erkunden der linearen Welt.

[b]Kommentar zu VR[/b]
Ich muss endlich mal weiter spielen.. Vanishing Realms war eins der ersten Spiele, dass ich in VR ausprobiert hab und durch das ich auch begeistert wurde. Es gibt noch sehr viel Amateurhaftes da draußen, natürlich der technologischen Komplexität geschuldet. Ein halbwegs gehyptes Spiel wie Arizona Sunshine fand ich zum Beispiel gar nicht so gut, wie es gemacht wurde, es war eher der gute erste Eindruck und meißt ist das in VR schon alles, was zählt, viel mehr Inhalt gibt es manchmal nicht wirklich. Ist zu verschmerzen und mein Kopf dankt es mir, die virtuelle Realität ist nach wie vor anstrengend...

[b]Zwischen Anstrengung und Euphorie[/b]
Eins der Spiele, die plus Qualität auch noch Quantität mitbringt ist Vanishing Realms, man kann so ziemlich alles tun, was VR ausmacht. Gucken, Rumhampeln, kurz die Brille abnehmen, weil man sich vor Anstrengung setzen muss, und andere mehr oder weniger alltägliche Nebenwirkungen. 

Die Grafik gefällt mir echt gut, es ist schlicht gehalten; auf die gute Art. Eine detailverliebte Umwelt wie in Skyrim VR ist es mit Sicherheit nicht, aber es sieht dennoch ansehnlich aus. Klein und kompakt hab ich in VR auch ehrlichgesagt lieber, der Kopf wird schon genug überfordert.

Die Kämpfe gegen die Gegner machen unheimlich viel Spaß und ist mit das Beste, was es aktuell in dem Segment gibt. Es ist einfach gehalten mit Blocken, Schlagen und Bogenschießen und erfordert doch eine gewisse Körperliche Anstrengung. Die Bewegungsabläufe sind flüssig und die Hits bzw. Misses sind nachvollziehbar, man muss halbwegs genau zielen. 

Fortbewegung läuft durch Teleportation. Ich hab die Erfahrung gemacht, dass das für den Körper einfacher zu akzeptieren ist, in Minecraft wird mir persönlich leicht schwindelig. Ist sicher Typsache, aber das ist VR sowieso immer.

[b]Die Mühe wert[/b]
Jetzt weiß ich, wie sich die Kritiker am Anfanger des Gaming gefühlt haben, man muss Sachen bewerten, die mittlerweile in nicht-VR-Spielen selbstverständlich sind. VR ist ganz am Anfang und Vanishing Realms ist ein guter Start!",76561198184866498,326,41,179,0,159,1548287892,1547506266,1547506387,True,7,1,0.630681812763214111,1,True,False,True

48212383,english," With all the new VR dungeon games out now, I was worried that I might have waited too long to play this one. I thought it might have simply been eclipsed by newer games with better graphics, etc.

I was wrong. This still seems like the best VR dungeon game out there. Yes, the graphics are somewhat simple, but they are also highly polished, and more importantly, all the graphical elements mesh together to create a seamless, believable VR world. There is a consistency to the presentation here that goes a long way to creating that all important sense of immersion. The sound design is also top notch.

And then you have the melee-style combat which, to my mind, still has not been superseeded elsewhere. It's both fun and somewhat challenging in that you can't just flail away and hope to prevail.

So a great visual and sonic presentation along with a good combat system equals great gameplay IMO. Vanishing Realms remains one of the best if not the best VR games of its type and I highly recommend it.

Update: After several years in EA with no meaningful updates the game came out of EA with no updates and a paid DLC with all the additional content, the base price isn't really worth it and the DLC sounds like it contains most of the game, really disappointing after such a promising start but I guess this is one of those possible outcomes when you support a developer in the early stages of a game.

42796987,russian,"Игра была пройдена примерно за 5 часов неторопливого прохождения. Здесь хватает и боев с монстрами, и всяческих тайничков, и несложных загадок. Причем, исследование подземелья и бои хорошо между собой чередуются, поэтому не устаешь ни от того, ни от другого. В конце же вас ждет настоящее испытание ваших боевых способностей - главное, чтоб джойстики остались целыми, когда в запале будете крушить стены и предметы в своей комнате))

Очень рекомендую в начале игры сразу поставить галочку напротив сложности «Hard», т.к. первый раз зайдя в игру и не заметив этой опции, я начала скучать уже после нескольких стычек с монстрами, т.к. они не представляли никакой угрозы в бою. А вот с повышенной сложностью стало намного интересней – тут для лечения уже и еда понадобилась, которая до этого казалась ненужной, и даже несколько раз пришлось умереть.

К слову, смерть в игре очень разочаровала тем, что она не накладывает никаких штрафов на игрока – ты просто воскресаешь неподалеку с полным здоровьем, а все монстры, которых ты убил, так и остаются убитыми. Таким образом можно хоть об каждого второго монстра убиваться – все равно ничего не потеряешь, зато получишь бесплатное лечение, и это даже может послужить стимулом лишний раз умереть, что я считаю неправильно. В общем, если не использовать эту недоработку игры намеренно, а пытаться по-честному всеми силами выжить, то играть будет гораздо интересней.

For Developers of Vanishing Realms:
I really like this game. The ""Hard"" difficulty was very interesting - glad that game has this option. However, the player’s death should not be so free! After death, the player resurrects with a full health, and the monsters remain killed - this greatly simplifies the game, reducing interest. Would like that after death the player return to the state that was before the battle, and the pack of monsters that killed the player would respawned again (as a normal auto-save/load). It would be honest and interesting.

As an old-skool gamer who has read various fiction to do with the future of VR (The Web 2027/2028, Ready Player One etc.), before getting a VR rig I was always most excited about the idea of VR high fantasy, and this hits the spot.

The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is fun and overall it's an absolute blast.  For the sake of completeness i will suggest two areas in which it could do better:
1) The fighting - in melee there are few openings by traditional means - most higher level enemies have shields and you can't hit them with normal stabbing, slashing or overhead shots.  You have to come over the top with your sword (/mace/hammer etc.) only.  This leads to quite repetitive fights and the enemies don't really change their tactics so you just keep doing the same move.
2) The writing.  It feels like this game was made by non-English speakers.  That's fine, but if you're going to release it in English, get a creative English writer to help with your content.  The riddles commonly don't rhyme or scan, and seem to be like a bad translation from another language.  In a few hours a good writer could have improved these and made a big input into immersion.

You collect stuff, that later on you find you actually need, you solve little puzzles, fight different foes and the ending is, for what it is, pretty satisfying.

Whilst quite short, it's made up for by the well implemented mechanics and engaging RPG atmosphere. This is the only RPG I've played to completion in VR yet, and haven't had enough! I sincerely hope this is continued.

The plot is not hugely complex, but is interesting and engaging nonetheless. The game does a good job of explaining the background with good use of environmental props to support it. From quite early on in the game you feel like you know your place and how to proceed. I would love to see the lore expanded on in future, as in it's current form there is not overly much explained about *why* things are the way they are.

Both teleportation and ""walking"" are available as movement options, both feeling very intuitive making the world easy to navigate around without much thought.
Interacting with the environment is quite satisfying, and interactable props respond well to the player.

Combat is incredibly easy once you get used to it, but considering the limitations posed by VR this is very understandable. With mouse and keyboard it's very easy to turn and dodge very fast, but not so much in VR. The headset cable, real world objects, walls etc generally make rapid combat tricky for the player, especially for people in a small space like me. Despite the ease with which enemies can be dispatched, I have no complaints about the combat.

I definitely consider this a ""must play"" VR game as it gets so many aspects of VR gaming so very right. At the current price (£15 UK) it's a little expensive; 3 hours playtime to complete is £5 an hour, so maybe consider picking up on sale if you're unsure.

I have played all kinds of games, everything from Myst to Thief to Fallout 1/2 to Diablo to Legend Of Zelda and even old Doom. I have been waiting over 20 years for viable VR, and in December, when I went to choose games to buy, this game was one of the first 10 I bought. It was also the first VR RPG I played. I loved it so much that it became the rule for grading other games, lol. I play VR to be immersed, and to escape my life and my depression; I guess you could call it an emotional support tool, and I don't care if it seem antisocial, as it is keeping me alive. Anyway, I have played through both chapters of the game, and have even started a new game on hard settings. It is just a LOT of fun, and really no one can own a VR rig and NOT play this game, it should be a law, (unless you hate RPGs and fun, and if so why did you get a VR rig in the first place, wacko?)

PROS:
-Middle filler content is good, seamless
-Plenty to do and fight
-Some side stuff, like shooting apples for an achievement. Yum apples.
-Beautiful

Cons:
-The double ax sucks (or I suck using it or both)
-Not sure achievements are functional?
-The bow could maybe have a longer draw, or maybe my arms are too long? Also, it doesnt seem to track a fully-drawn notched arrow well if you hold a shot for a while. I have noticed this in other VR bow games to lesser or greater degrees, especially if I wear a hoody with the hood down. Hmmm?
-So immersive you could get hurt or break equipment. I have bruised a knee falling over a coffee table, and I broke my wand on the first day I got my VR rig, trying to cut open a skeleton guy when IRL I hit the wand on the wall. I had to take the wand apart and do the infamous thumbpad fix.

There is some room for improvement, and I’m sure dungeon crawlers will get more sophisticated as we get used to VR gaming. I do appreciate that this game was brought to market quickly—so I could play it! 

If I could offer recommendations to the devs, I could do without the cartoony enemies, as it made the game feel like a kid’s game. I wouldn’t have minded more variation in enemies, either. As far as combat goes, everything felt very natural. Enemies were tough before I figured out their weaknesses.  I really liked the bow! On the other hand, magic was super overpowered, and it seemed weird that enemies would just wait around for you to approach them, even if you were shooting them with arrows. 

All said, a great effort, and I’m picky with games. I will buy the next installment, for sure.

- For only 3 hours of gameplay, it is overpriced just like most VR games, but this is a bit much.
- Yes, the dev promised there will be ""more"" for the same price, but nothing has been developed in more than a year. Dishonesty?
- The first half of the game was extremely frustrating with the game automatically pausing whenever you approached the limits of your playspace. You can disable that in options but it always gets re-enabled (after restart) and it was very unclear that this is what was causing it.
- Playing on the Oculus Rift, during fighting I somehow (have NO idea how) kept pressing the pause button in heat of combat (which takes me to the SteamVR page and sometimes to the pause screen???) That would be so frustrating I wanted to throw the game out the window. There is of course no way to remap controls for the Rift.

I wish it were maybe a little more on the realistic looking scale than it is, but I do enjoy some of the fine details they have like skeletons eyes actually looking at and reacting to where my sword is.  If i hold it over my head pointed at them to try and go in for a side of the neck shot around their shield, their eyes look up and do the side in the direction of the tip of my sword.  It makes it feel more like combat would, and they properly react to your attacks and counter.  You can do stuff like block their incoming swing and reflect their arm away opening up a nice big gap to jab them.  Melee combat It's very satisfying.

Ranged combat, the bow and arrow stuff is pretty good.  I don't particularly like the magic staff combat though.  Right now i just have a fireball staff and it lobbs fireballs and there's no way to tell other than getting used to it how far the shots are going to go and at 100 mana cost per shot it depletes your mana quickly missing.

The game is extremely easy in terms of winning all your battles, none of them gave me any trouble at all, including any boss/mini bosses, but it was incredible fun nonetheless. The game makes you feel like youre an adventurer, with swords, shields, bows and more! I loved this game and it was easily worth its price on sale. The game is terribly short though, with two chapters. Chapter 1 was an adequate length, and I am satisfied with it. It never hit me that chapter 2 wont be as long, in fact, i finished chapter 2 in 436 seconds. Yes seconds. So while the developer did a great job with the game, saying there are 2 chapters is very misleading. Chapter one was exceptional, chapter 2 seems more like bait to make you purchase chapter 3 when it is released. After playing chapter 1 though, I already decided im buying the next chapters as soon as they come out!

But the way you handled the second chapter (you know what im talking about, im avoiding spoilers) was a great surprise but then the chapter ends after a total of about 10 mins of play, was extremely dissappointing.

39429571,english,"Definitely an interesting experience to start with, but held back by weak gameplay mechanics, as an experimental game developed by what I believe is a single person, it is good, however, the price tag, as with other VR games, is too steep.


The combat systems in the game certainly have some strong points; enemy armor and shields are reliable and interesting, melee combat is fun and the highly-telegraphed nature of all the moves allow ample time for even a new player to block an attack.

However, these all fall apart once movement gets involved, and while thumbstick-movement has been enabled in this game, a simple solution to all of these attacks is to walk backwards an inch, then walk forward as the enemy is winding down. Enemy arrows and projectiles become nothing but a reason to strafe back and forth as you throw arrows back at these enemies. Bosses desperately try to backpedal from you as you walk into them so that they can actually hit you, allowing the player to hold one joystick forward as they wiggle their wrist, defeating the enemy boss at little to no cost.

Enemy AI is also distressing; the first couple enemies will spawn in close to the player with an animation, but once this stops, enemies begin to show up standing lifelessly in plain view as they wait for the player to approach them; melee becomes a second thought as the ranged options of the game always overpower enemies who cannot or dare not approach, even with their occasional attempts to block and sidestep incoming arrows.

I have multiple other issues with this games' design, such as some assets not really matching the rest of the game or the gold system, but the aforementioned are the primary reasons.

Admittedly, as this is made by a small team, or single person, I couldn't say I expect them to cover all these bases, and I don't know how many of the mechanics in this game are stock unity assets from the store, but some of these systems are worth praise for a solo developer.

However, the size of the development team clearly hasn't affected the size of the hole in my pocket. This game is certainly not worth £15, nor do I think it's worth the £9 on sale; the rose-tinted goggles of VR itself have definitely lowered the bar of quality for games, because this game is certainly not deserving of its' overwhelmingly positive reviews.

39288862,english,"FINALLY got around to finishing this. I have to say, it is one of my favorite VR games now. 

The combat takes some getting used to. It can feel clunky at first, but during the game I grew to really like it. Sure, it's not perfect, but once you know how it works, it actually feels really cool to block or parry enemy's swings and hit him right in the weak spot. Enemies are invulnerable on armor and carry shields they know how to use, so you have to think a little to get hits in. Feels great if you manage to win a 1v2 flawlessly, or defeat some of the stronger enemies.
Ranged weapons are good, but I believe it is MUCH better with a decent play space. Moving furniture, I got to around 2m x 2m which was great. More is probably useless, since the game doesn't actually allow you to move freely, moving away from the center will pause the game. It can be annoying, but it was also helpful to stop me from running into walls. It still allows enough movement to dodge ranged attacks by sidestepping them or getting behind cover. Shooting an enemy while leaning out of cover is a cool thing too.

The world is built beautifully for VR, there's stuff to explore, things to interact with, and the path, while kinda linear, feels like a journey. The only part I disliked is the ""maze"", because it is very dark and VERY cramped. I'm sure that's what they were going for, because I have to admit, I was just too much of a pussy to play through it. It was scary for me, I had to have my wife next to me watching it to get through. Felt great to get out of it too! And actually using a torch in an rpg with your actual hand to light stuff up feels great too.

It's on the shorter side I guess, with 2.5 hours of play time for me for the normal story mode. There is a hard mode which I have yet to try. But the story was cool and left me wanting for more.",76561197989754301,366,23,135,0,135,1515778932,1515785590,1515785590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

39128245,english,"A modest videoludic experience but a really good foundation for what's to come next on VR. Vanishing Realms is a very short title with barely satisfying story telling and very little things to do actually. You'll follow a linear path filled with absolutely unchallenging yet somewhat ok fun puzzles and ennemies, you will have some moments of surprise too but nothing to be excited about. The worst is lack of interaction with any any form of entities or voice over to keep you under your wizard skin.

Playing the 1rst chapter I felt that the game does not give you any goals other than discovering what Dungeon Crawlers can do on VR. This is very true at least in the first chapter which does not have any enticing introdution to hook you up for the adventure to come, sucks that I have to read the not so generic intro, as soon as I read it I forgot it.

All the technical praises I heard and read for this game are legit for the most part. The locomotion is ok if you can tolerate to move that slowly when using the walking option, it's ok since you don't really have to walk long distances. You still have to ption to teleport but personally every time I play an Oculus game I am looking to avoid teleportation even though it's a potent sytem of locomotion that becomes very instinctive very quickly. The touch sytem is great nothing to say, good interface management as well. 

Vanishing Realms definitely marks a stepstone for Dungeon crawlers on VR but it's way too little especially for its selling price to satisfy an experienced gamer looking for a minimum of exciting gameplay and difficulty.

I played for 3h now and have finished the storyline/ the game. For me it was pure immersion and I'm happy I don't get nausea of teleporting around, meaning it's vr beginner friendly. The first part is ""just"" exploring, but it introduces you well into the gameplay mechanics and for it was fun because I found some hidden gold lying around. I was pretty scared as I made contact with the first skeleton enemy and gave me a pretty high adrenalin rush to fight it.

The Sprint option should be faster, as well as one click of the thumb stick, not held down.

The handling for the wand and really moreso the two handed axe on the rift is super wonky. I wanna master the axe but it just seems like the basic swords do the job easiest since you're able to take advantage of openings more frequently.

LOWS
- The Inventory is nicely set up, but moves around when you least want it to.
- The bow is kind of childlike, I wish it had a faster projectile,  I bought the more expensive one with this in mind.
- Smooth locomotion speed is too low. ""Sprint"" Is a medium paced walk. Walk is a creep. I end up having to warp if I need to travel long distances.
- Some enemies don't seem to react when you swing at legs

Do yourself a favor and swing the swords like sabers along with poking. Don't just poke like in the game play video because it's kind of boring.
I bought the more expensive bow hoping that I could have a better arrow velocity. I was disappointed.

It completely draws you in, you'll think you're crawling through a dungeon instead of standing in a living room. My friend got ambushed by an archer, and he ducked and took a step back to hide behind a wall; later he was trying to reach something, couldn't quite make so he jumped and smashed the controller into the ceiling, no harm done.
Drawing the bow is so close to real that you feel phantom resistence.
That's how much this game draws you in. And lets talk about options...
Lefyt? Sword in the left hand, shield in the right.
Dual Wielding, check...kill those boxes and barrels in one swipe.
Bow and arrow for a pseudo-stealthy archer, check and unlimited arrows. Angle and draw effect arrow range and arc.
Want to be ""the one"", put a sword in each hand and Neo out of the way of all incoming attacks.

Hit boxes are on point. A hard, fully extended jab to an armored area will do damage, whereas a light fast jab to the same area will do no damage; but if you hit an unarmored area, you get full damage with just a light hit.

We didn't get far enough to try out magic, so no comment.

Its like if Zelda were a vr game. It has everything you'd imagine. Skeleton monsters, swords, bow and arrow, sheilds, all with very good controls. Infact the controls are probably the best I've ever seen in VR. Everything from putting an apple in your pouch, to shooting a wizard in the face feels so intuivite and nice. I wish superhot had throwing physics this intuitive. Watch out if you have a low ceiling though.

The axe and the enemy types are my only complaints. The two handed axe feels off, and there are only a few enemies types before the game just shrugs and starts reskinning the same things with more health. But a couple really solidly designed monster types is much better than a thousand badly made ones. So its a fair trade off. Especially for a 20 dollar VR game with amazing visuals and gameplay.

The ability to manipulate your environment is vastly superior in this game to other VR dungeon crawlers that I've tried.

If I had to nitpick, I'd say I would prefer just tapping the right stick to snapturn as opposed to holding it down and moving it left or right. That makes your thumb really sore after extended play. Also, just a personal preference, but I prefer using a button on the right controller for teleport as in most other games that support teleportation. Those could be easily added as options I would imagine. Maybe a little bit better save management would be nice. Other than that, this game is a masterpiece. It is exactly what I always dreamed a VR dungeon crawler could be. I love the scrolls you find and the way you handled secrets, traps and puzzles. The atmosphere is spot on.

[b][u]Value - 7[/u][/b] - The only reason I didn't give it a higher score, is that I realize the price is kind of high.  Also, even though the game is tons of fun, it is a tad short (shouldn't take more than a couple of hours for a first playthrough, and they can be done in maybe 45 minutes after that).  Replayability is a bit on the low side as well.

[b][u]Originality - 10[/u][/b] - As I said before, this has become the standard for this adventure genre in VR.  There's some similar types of games in non-VR (perhaps Skyrim... but more linear.. a good example isn't coming to mind).  

[b][u]Controls - 10[/u][/b] - Pretty much every imaginable control scheme has been implemented at this point.  You've got teleportation, gliding, umm... some others (a combo of teleportation and glide is all I use).  Sword fighting (and archery) are both well done.  Movement is smooth, and hits on the enemies are accurate.

One thing in particular I thought was fun, was if you're at a place where a melee enemy can't reach you and are shooting it with arrows, after a hit or two they begin side-stepping your arrows.  It's still possible to hit them, but it makes for a difficult tactic.

Also, after a bit you get a mining pick and these little ore nodes become another source of income.  Mining them is quite fun and feels very Minecraft-y... but there's not so many nodes that it becomes tedious.

[b][u]Graphics - 8[/u][/b] - The graphics are a bit cartoony, but it works.  Generally, I prefer a cartoony look to badly-done realism.  Gives a nice buffer where you can excuse things that aren't quite right.  Enemy models aren't overly stiff, and move well; although combat feels a little basic.  The terrain layout and textures are good as well.

[b][u]Sound - 7[/u][/b] - Sound is ok.  Sounds effects are what they need to be.  Enemies yell at you a little and make some noise.  I can't recall if there's background music or not (which I suppose isn't a good sign).  I don't recall if there's ambiance sound effects either.

[b][u]Fun - 10[/u][/b] - The game is pretty good at making you feel like a badass with a sword and shield.  Enemies are just tough enough (unless you're a Gorn expert... in which case combat won't be too difficult).  There's a good mix of melee skeletons, archers, spell casters, and giants to fight.  You end up armed with a sword and shield, bow, fireball wand, and 2-handed axe (which is a bit difficult to get the hang of... and again having played Gorn would be helpful here).  

[b][u]Overall - 10[/u][/b] - You spend just enough time exploring and poking around in boxes and burning piles of leaves/straw on the floor looking for treasure with interspersed combat to keep things from getting to tedious or boring.  Level layout is good.  Just complex enough in places to make you feel a little lost, without being too difficult to actually find your way through.

37971980,english,"Perhaps one of the best Vive games out there. Feels polished and well-concieved.

Basically it's more or less linear dungeon crawler / simplish RPG, sure, but it does everything soo well compared to other VR games. The inventory system is excellent and still simple to use, the combat feels right and makes you move in room space a bit swinging sword or taking covers from enemy arrows, the level design allows for some movements to grab items out of reach/behind stone pillar etc. Movement can be both teleportation (feels ok in here) and touchpad. Extra point for very nice chaperon implementation where moving too fast or swinging too fast outside of boundaries pauses the game and forces player to re-center.

Graphics are a bit on cartoonish side style wise (it's usually BIG no-no for some like me) but in VR it works creating nice and immersive for most parts fairytale environment.

There are some little puzzles here but this title begs for more physics based ones IMO.

I had so much fun shooting arrows at flying wizards, chopping my sword at bulky skeletons and blocking crossbow bolts of undead archers with my trusty shield. 

Vanishing Realms is a full room experience. You need that extra space to fight, dodge, parry and slash at anything that comes your way. You can duck behind cover, crawl under perilous blade traps on hands and knees and hoist yourself up on ropes and chains. There is tons of hidden treasure to collect (although it's very easy to max out on the gear you can purchase), some light puzzles to solve and a big dungeon te explore. Stalking through the labyrinthine tunnels, my shield raised for anything that might jump out of the shadows while I was keeping an eye out for traps, was just an overal great experience and one of my best moments I've had in VR so far. 

And while it is not perfect (I'd like to see more RPG influences, a less linear setting, maybe some NPC interaction and even more different locations) Vanishing Realms is a complete and polished VR experience.

Picking items can be a bit easier. Like, having to individually pick up coins is tideous. I think having them gravitate to you when you get close enough will work better. People shouldn't have to individually pick up every single coin. Also when picking up an item like an apple, it should work like coins in my opinion. It should just automatically go to the inventory without having to manually click again. Just clicking once to pick it up should be enough to have it go automatically to your inventory.

These are my issues. Other than that, the game is very very well made. I specifically like how solid the game is, I like all the boundaries the game has in place to prevent it from being a cheap VR experience, for example you can't look through walls, you can't cheat kill enemies.

35982987,english,"to be honest, i was disapointed... not by the fact i paid 20 dollars for 3 hours of fun, but the fact that it was a dungeon crawler and greatly wanted some sort of classic RPG, build your skills up with lots of loot to shift through game. Even the chapter 2 felt like a shoe horned element that was suppose to be some sort of replay value end game. but everything started to become predictable and made me say ""Is that it..."" as i got to the end. 

If i was to say what this game really is, Id have to say its is a text based story adventure with hack and slash, You'll get new weapons if you pick up gold, but over all you can beat the game with the first sword you get, and a bow, forcing you to just push threw the game. If your worried about inventory, it doesnt really matter, If you want more dmg, it doesnt really matter, If you want a difficulty, it doesnt really matter. all that matters is getting to the end of the game. and having fun doing it.

If your like me and just wanted a dungeon crawler with tons of loot, micro managing weapons, Visiting a shop for upgrades or selling loot, some sort of feeling of having a game plan when running into the enemy, or even a feeling of longevity to play the game, I wouldnt reccomend this game, its just another story driven game like the rest of the VR games out there.

35814079,english,"Such an awesome game. I can't wait to try the new updates. And even though I've played this with only teleportation so far, it is one of the best, most satisfying teleportation methods out there, and makes me almost not care that there was no free locomotion up until recently (and I just found out in the news on this game's page, after not having played this title for a while, since I have played it so much in the past)...and I don't prefer teleportation games where free locomotion should exist in such a world as ths game has. So again, I can't wait to try it, but I guess I could wait to give this review. Just knowing that it's so good with my least favorite form of locomotion, with teleporting...says a lot.

It is one of the most immersive VR games I've played, and I'm not a big RPG guy either.

The premise is simple - you creep around a dungeon (and sometimes the outdoors), avoiding traps, fighting skeletal warriors and archers, and hunting for treasure (both obvious and inobvious). You can buy better gear when you find enough gold, and there are a few boss fights. 

The graphics are not too scary; I think ages 9 - 109 could play this game. It's a very good looking game, and has inside and outdoors locations to explore. The AI is not super sophisticated - I wouldn't call this a hardcore game by any means, but it's challenging enough to be fun without being terribly frustrating.

It's not gory, and though it does have a startle or two in it.

One good feature is that if you get to close to the boundaries of your roomscale space, it will paus e the game, and let you re-center yourself before continuing. When you are swinging a sword, this is an essential feature!

It's not terribly long, but it's long enough to be worth the price, and you'll play it more than once. Also,  you'll make your friends play it when they come over, because it's easy to grasp as a game, it's fun, and it's visually impressive without overtaxing your graphics card.

35603116,english,"I've played much worse for more money, this game is definitely worth buying. Control wise, it's very smooth and fluid, and barring the times the controllers got lost (due to myself being in the way of the sensors), the mechanics and swordplay feel really well done. The tone of the game is well established, and although not quite to my personal taste, still well done.

My only major issue is that there's no way to turn around without physically turning your body, which caused the disconnection of the controllers. If our HMDs were wireless, this wouldn't be an issue, but due to the current limitations of being tethered to our computers, it's practically imparitive that we are able to use the controller to turn (via a joystic on the touch controllers, or on of the vive's trackpads). 

Something else I'd like to see is smooth locomotion as an option. I should be able to move out of the way of the enemy's attacks without having to teleport. I know teleportation is a major gameplay neccessity for those gamers who get motion sickness, but for those of us who don't, smooth locomotion give a much more immersive experience. 

There are other tweaks and improvements that could be made, for example the UI seems a little odd in my opinion, having to look down while in a fight to check your health. A suggestion i could make would be to layer a health/mana bar in the top left corner of the player's view so they could look at it when they need to, without losing focus on the enemy. This was done successfully with your score in RoboRecall, where you would look at the bottom corner to check your points, without actually moving your head.

Mood and atmosphere were great from the get go. localized torchlight was such a nice touch and the lighting of scenes throughout always impressed me, although dark areas could have been darker. Even without the torch there was only one place i struggled to see clearly. sounds and music added to the dungeon feel. Kudos to the designers.

Game play was very enjoyable with accurate aiming and pinpoint swordplay. you are not going to wildly swing your weapon and expect results. The peril level is fairly low with very few ""startling moments"" an no ""horror"" , making this adventure excellent for children. As an adult and veteran gamer I may have asked for more but that is not a criticism. 

There were some times that melee  felt a little lackluster. Here's why.....
Enemies were for the most part activated by proximity not line of sight. you could often stand quite close and just stare at them, so they lacked a ""threatening"" attitude. It was also easy to stay out of the areas of multiple enemies and engage them one at at time, and too easy to run away. Maybe slow the teleport dot even more than it already moves ( a good feature that is a clever way simulate player run speed)

Lastly, while there were elements of puzzle play most were easy (very easy) and the bosses posed only moderate challenge. I never ran out of health and had ample food to regenerate. There were lots of nooks to look into but few things to collect and (so far) not very many upgrades to shoot for. there wasn't ever i time that an object was out of reach and as far as i can tell  few reasons to revisit past areas. But this was my first go at it  and that was on default settings....and i did not get all achievements. 6 hrs total play time for about $25 is good value and i will play again for some things i am sure i missed.

35166667,english,"This game delivers the promise of VR.  For a mere $13.99 (current sale price) you get a game that pushed the boundaries of what one could expect in a VR title.  This is a complete VR experience.  Don't let the negative reviews or the status of EA or lack of constant updates stop you from getting this game.  This is a MUST buy VR title.  If you own a Vive, Oculus, whatever, you owe it to yourself to experience this game.

A lot of the negative reviews mention locomotion.  Well, you're not teleporting anymore unless you want to.  You can mostly move freely using your touch controller's joystick.  It's not perfect, you have to click down to go faster or to turn. But it's done very well. 

A lot of the other negative reviews mention lack of updates.  Well, this game is pretty much a finished product.  I have 1.7 hours on Steam currently and I still have not finished the game.  And there's a whole area I haven't explored.  Keep in mind that the normal price is $19.99.  This is a lot of content for the price.  And it's not just average content or above average content, this is AMAZING content for the price.  I played 1.7 hours straight because I was having so much fun.  I plan to get right back into the game later today.  That's because I loved the game world.  I have not experienced any bugs on the Oculus Rift w/ Touch.

The dungeons are so well designed and intuitive.  The puzzles are logical (no having to search for a  key that's hidden in some vase under a cabinet type crap).  The riddles are creative (yes, riddles).  You have different tools at your disposal, including food, pickaxe, torch, sword, shield, bow & arrow, or wand.  Also, climbing up the ropes or chains is just so much fun to get that extra bit of loot or spoiler alert [spoiler] burning curtains to get the items hidden beneath or breaking barrels with your sword to get more coins [/spoiler]

Admittedly, the weakest part of the game is probably the melee combat.  I didn't find it very challenging.  But I did enjoy using the bow and arrow.  And nothing is more satisfying that beating down that skeleton archer with a sword after he's been trying to pick you off.

Movement is a combination of roomscale and artificial locomotion with a choice of teleportation and recently added free movement. I particularly enjoy the latter as it is implemented in a way that feels rather natural and is not VR sickness inducing in any way; there are even some advanced anti-sickness options for those who are succeptible.

34015831,spanish,"Hace dos días que compré las Oculus Rift y este ha sido uno de los primeros juegos que he jugado después de ver que el 100% de los usuarios lo recomendaba. Dudé un poco por dos cosas. Primero, el juego está en early access. Y segundo, solo da soporte a HTC Vive. Pero os puedo decir que el juego es perfectamente jugable. No he encontrado aún nigún motivo para el estado de early access, excepto un pequeñísimo parpadeo al teletransportarse. Segundo, el juego es completamente compatible con Oculus rift + oculus touch (con la configuracion experimental de 360 grados con dos sensores). Simplemente verás en tus manos los mandos de Vive al principio, aunque rápidamente serán una bola de luz con la que puedes hacer todo lo que haces con los mandos de htc vive. Así que si tienes oculus no tendrás problemas para jugar. 

Adicionalmente es recomendable un area de juego de al menos 2x2m pero no es obligatoria. Tienes un teletransportador que te permite jugar en un area un poco menor. 

El juego está en inglés sin subtítulos. Para mi no es un gran problema, aunque he visto que los acertijos te dan las pistas en un inglés con rimas que puede ser un poco dificil de entender para algunas personas. Aún así no hay mucho texto en el juego, así que no es que te vayas a pasar todo el día mirando el diccionario. 

En lo referente al juego en sí es bastante inmersivo, Me sorprendió mucho verme a mi mismo esquivando flechas, poniéndome en guardia frente a un enemigo. Intentando cubrirme con mi escudo... Esto es lo que se espera de un rpg para realidad virtual. Y sin duda, si alguna vez has deseado estar dentro de tu RPG favorito, esta es una buena ocasión para conseguirlo.

34000578,english,"This  game is by far my favorite VR game I have in my collection. I felt very immersed and rather surprised at the depth the enemies had when fighting. I had to learn the move sets of each enemy and know how to properly defend and attack. Looking for openings was the most fun because the enemies even adapted to my fighting style. They would cover and dodge almost as well as the player can. The layout of the dungeons were rather fun to explore. I often found myself wondering if I was going to stumble into a place I wasnt yet prepared for. The map design does a rather good job of encouraging exploration and discovering secrets. Finding all the hidden treasures was my favorite activity because hiding spots become so much harder when you actually have to duck behind things and look above into the rafters. I was throwing rocks before I bought a bow to knock items off of ledges. The things in this game are rather simple in comparison to a AAA RPG but experiencing them makes all the difference. These simple activities become very fun. Seeing a video does not do this game justice, it must be experienced in VR. The art style is also well done in my opinion and is pretty to look at while not making the enemies completely horrifying. While I thouroughly enjoyed this game and it is my favorite. I did feel it was lacking. I just want more, more to explore, more secrets to find, more to discover, more enemyu types, more locomotion options, other NPCs to interact with and buy from. It has a decent weapon selection and the inventory and player information system is by far the most natural and intuitive than any other game I have played. I just want more because it is so good. However considering, as far as I am aware, that this game is made by as single developer I am quite impressed with the game in its current state.

Like most, I was extremely skeptical about the very young, very ""gimmicky"" HTC Vive.

- where I was immediately transported to an enormous dungeon of old, wielding but a simple torch as I walked through the first doorway, only to be greeted by a dark, looming evil voice that seemingly came from the walls themselves.

Here, you will explore ancient dungeons, collect coins to buy weapons and items that will decide whether or not you live or die, actually physically crawl through trap rooms just to get to the next hallway, fight skeletons that are bigger than you ever could've imagined, and this is all just in the first 20 minutes of gameplay. 

Here, you will truly get lost in an unreal atmospheric dungeon crawling experience. You will never forget it as long as you live, I guarantee that. There is simply nothing like this game.

This is really excellent. I just spent 90 minutes in it for what was supposed to be a quick look around and just...couldn't leave.

Ok. Criticism. The swordplay feels a bit arcade-like. And it's got the same problem that sword fighting games always have in VR. And I think I have some advice, that I've been handing out to every developer I've found who's working on this kind of thing.

Change your swordfighting mechanic so that it's like when you draw the sword you go into an altered state.

Obviously, this means slow motion. Which is how we all instinctively did sword fighting when we were kids. Because you aren't going to have serious swordplay at real sword-swinging speeds and be able to actually intercept stabs and slashes in a realistic way. Not at speed. Which leaves us with this really imprecise version of swordfighting that's been dumbed down. But that takes the joy out of the swordfight itself! I mean, it's still cool because you're in a mystic cave and you're fighting a skeleton and so on, but the swordfighting part gets old fast because of everything I just described.

So slow it down. Make the swordfight work on a flexible timescale very much like the basic mechanic in SuperHot. When you pick up your sword, everything should slow down to timescale slaved to how fast you move. And if you try to stab your sword through their shield or armor or a wall (i.e., you don't stop swinging when it hits a barrier and you see sparks fly and the controller buzzes in your hand or whatever), you drop your sword and have to duck down and scoop it up (which isn't life threatening in slow-motion...but it's a setback and you probably won't do it too many times in a row).

Then you can make the hitpoints go way, way up in both directions - a hard slash across the belly should be fatal (for the player or the NPC's). Smooth out and polish the animations a bit so they pass muster in slow motion. That especially goes for the animations when you kill them. Maybe work in some halfway-there maiming scripting - if you cut off an arm or leg, they're pretty much done for, but not before they make one or two last clumsy attempts to kill you with their remaining limbs. Do that, and players will actually get really excited about any opportunity for melee combat.",76561198092678368,94,17,297,0,96,1496001765,1491622258,1491622258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Like most current VR titles, very short. I played once-through in 1h. Speed-ran the second pass in 10-20m. I like the game enough I just dilly-dally in the world, though I've exhausted it. I hope they release more content soon!

A floating inventory system is a great idea.

A fully interactive 3D environment with destructable and tossable tiems, is very well done, and hides treasure in all sorts of places forcing you to look into barrels, under tables, and smash all the things.

It forces a repetitive ""strike, parry, strike, parry"" experience that is not very engaging and feels like it is forcing me to play the way the game wants to. Most of the damage I took was from striking and then brining my sword back around for a parry but the blade wasn't turned back on and the enemy just hit me anyway.

This took me much longer to get through than I thought it would, and that's a pleasant surprise. Vanishing Realms is very easy to lose yourself in, and I mean that in a good way. There are some sprawling areas of the world here, though it sometimes feels sparsely populated. You have your melee guys, your ranged folks, your magic fellows, your mini boss types, but they're the only inhabitants of this world. I would have liked to see some wildlife, even if it wasn't interactable (like a scripted scene where something runs out ahead of you) just to give you a sense that there was a living, breathing world here. Maybe there isn't though, and that's the point of the game!

1. You have to buy every equippable with money, with maybe one or two exceptions. Working through a puzzle or fighting through a lot of enemies and getting to the next item but not having enough money to buy it is a pretty bad feeling.

2. The first sword you can buy at the cheapest is fine, I used it all the way through the first chapter. If you want a different one you have to go all the way back and get another, which is long and tedious. They should be spaced out through the level to let you upgrade. Dual-wielding feels pretty awesome and works well too.

3. Don't buy the axe... Just don't. Save your gold. Super unsatisfying damage with some wonky controls. The top tier sword costs less and does more damage. Winding up and swinging it only to have it do no damage off a shield or helmet needs to be fixed. Armor penetration anyone?

Затягивает с первых секунд игры. Полное погружение за счет возможности взаимодействия со всем окружением. Завезли и линейный сюжет, и побочки в стиле фарма голды, поисков тайников, получения ачивок и просто исследования огромного открытого мира. Приятно реализованный инвентарь для всевозможных полезностей.
Радует, что голда собирается не просто так, а для получения более мощного лута - фактически все, что ты находишь, так или иначе станет полезным. Очень интересная механика боя, умные, но не слишком суровые мобы, способные блокировать твои атаки, уклоняться от стрел, прятаться за укрытиями. К счастью, монстра не ломится на тебя скопом и не гоняет по всем локациям, следовательно игра остается проходимой: всю живность надо завалить собственными руками. 
Невероятная атмосфера мистического подземелья чередуется с живописными открытыми пространствами. Перемещение телепортацией - абсолютный плюс для игры: тебе и так приходится крутиться на 360 градусов, при этом игра не укачивает.

30758794,german,"Dieses Spiel ist eines der besten VR-Titel für die HTC-Vive, welches ich bislang gespielt habe.

Hier meine positiven und negativen Punkte des Spiels. Unten dran hänge ich dann auch noch einige weitere Ideen, welche ich hätte.

Positiv:
+ Grafik im Comicstil. Man taucht schon in der ersten Sekunde vollkommen ein in diese Welt.
+ Gameplay. Die Waffen funktionieren unglaublich gut und die Schläge sind sehr Präzise. Man hat das Gefühl, man würde       tatsächlich ein Schwert führen oder mit dem Bogen zielen
+ Shops. Es gibt mehrere kleine ""Shops"" in denen man verschiedene Waffen kaufen kann.
+ Waffenarsenal. Die vielfalt an Waffen ist unglaublich gut. Es gibt 3 verschiedene Schweter, einen Hammer, 2 Bögen, einen Zauberstab (Der Mana benötigt) eine 2-Hand Axt und natürlich einen Schild
+ Atmosphäre. Die Atmosphäre ist düster gehalten und stimmt zum Setting.
+ Mining. Man bekommt im Verlauf des Spiels eine Spitzhacke, mit der man Erze abbauen kann. (Die Erze werden entweder zu Gold oder zu Mana)
+ Das 1. Kapitel. Das erste Kapitel ist unglaublich Detailverliebt, man findet überall interessante Dinge und kommt häufig aus dem Staunen nicht raus. (meine Spielzeit betrug für das 1. Kapitel knapp 3,5 Std. was aber auch daran lag, dass ich mir Zeit für das Spiel genommen habe und nicht durchgerusht bin)
+ Teleportieren. Ich hatte nicht ein einziges Mal einen Anflug von Motionsickness.
+ Die Gegner. Es ist ein unbeschreibliches Gefühl vor den Gegner zu stehen. Besonders die Minibosse, welche gut 2,5 - 3m groß sind, sind beeindruckend!
+ Die Kämpfe. Wenn man mit dem Schwert nicht gerade hin- und herwedelt als sei es ein Staubfänger sind die Kämpfe wahnsinnig gut. Spielt man das Spiel mit Blocken/Parieren - Angreifen, dann fordert einen jeder Kampf aufs neue. Ich habe immer darauf geachtet, was der Gegner als nächstes plant, den Angriff bestmöglichst mit dem Schild geblockt oder dem Schwert/Hammer pariert und dann zugeschlagen. Unglaubliches Gefühl!

Negativ:
- Das 2. Kapitel. Nach dem unglaublich guten Start des 1. Kapitels ist das 2. dann wirklich eine große Enttäuschung. Meine Spielzeit betrug gute 30 Minuten, dann war es schon vorbei. Es ist leider nur eine Arena mit allen bekannten Gegnern, welche Wellenartig mit einem im Ring stehen.
- Die 2-Hand-Axt. Das Kämpfen mit dieser Waffe ist eine einzige Tortur. Ich verstehe die Idee dahinter, aber es funktioniert leider so gar nicht :( Schade.
- Nach einem Neustart des Spiels ""spawnen"" alle Erze und Äpfel etc. wieder in der Welt. Das macht einige Erfolge etwas unsinnig.


Meine Ideen für Chapter 3 oder Upgrades von Chapter 1&2
○ Crafting. Man bekommt schon im Spielverlauf eine Spitzhacke in die Hand gedrückt, wieso also nicht auch verschiedene Erze abbauen können und vielleicht an einer Schmiede (Welche irgendwo eingebaut werden könnte) sich seine eigenen Waffen bauen?
○ Interaktion mit den Feuerschalen. Häufig findet man Feuerschalen in einem Raum, das Entzünden bewirkt leider gar nichts. Die Schalen könnte man auch dafür benutzen um Gänge freizuschalten oder Türen zu öffnen, statt immer einen Schlüssel oder Hebel zu suchen
○ NPC's in Shops. Was mir sehr gut gefallen würde wären NPC's mit denen man interagieren muss um Gegenstände zu erwerben.

30454092,english,"I bought this game on sale thinking it was going to be some 20-30 minute rinky dinky polished VR turd experience. Nope, instead it was the exact opposite. I'm being completely honest here, this game is literally one of the best VR games I've touched on the Vive, all bullsh*t aside. The only other game I've played that actually felt like a FULL game and not a tech demo experience was Lucky's Tale on the Oculus Rift. 

Vanishing Realms took me almost 6 hours to beat, and while that may sound small, that's actually pretty long for a VR title. Honestly I became so immersed in the game that it felt a little bit longer than it actually is due to the sense of presence. In this game you actually FEEL like you're in another world due to the sense of presence, which is most VR titles I think, but this game actually makes you feel like you're a warrior on a quest in a virtual world, it feels legit. The graphics are a bit cartoony but honestly who gives a sh*t? Not this guy.

You fight skeleton warriors, mages, bosses, etc. You can mine ore, use a magic wand, use 3 different types of swords, an axe, hammer, 2 different bows. There's traps to avoid, chalices to collect, not really any puzzles (personally I hate puzzles). The game seems super easy at first, but it starts to get quite challenging. It's not too difficult, but difficult enough that you can't just stand there like a statue swinging your vive controller like an idiot, it requires a bit of tactic and you actually feel like you're fighting a real battle. The enemy AI isn't that great and seems a bit cheap-ish, but I think fighting in this game feels really nice regardless. I used mostly sword, shield, and a bow. The enemies try to swing at you in different ways with their weapons if you fight up close, you can block the incoming attacks with your sword or shield and it feels like you're actually blocking everything, it's very responsive. The game will make you move around a bit (if you have space), and potentially make you work up a sweat lol

I applaud the devs for this, you guys did a really good job. The game isn't super amazing, but it's still a really well made VR title that deserves some attention I think. This is probably the closest thing you're gonna get to an ""Elder Scrolls"", ""Legend of Zelda"" kind of experience on VR at the moment, and for 20 bucks it's not bad.

The only thing I would like to try is a different, slower locomotion option as the teleporting can allow you to zoom through areas.

The combat is challenging (if not a slight bit wonky) but the weapons are all fun to use. The enemy designs are all really cool too. Threatening in a cartooish way that doesn't come off as silly.

What this game nails though is the overall mood and feel of each area. The spooky castles, the swamps, grand halls filled with fire mages. Each new fight is a new challenge and the backdrops can really add to the tension in some areas.

I love the enviroments and spent an age just gazing up at the sky or celling. The game experience may be short but I had a blast from the opening screen right to the end. It's the little touches that I loved. That gold cup stood high up on a plinth. Grab a rock, knock the bugger down. Trophy trapped on a wall in a web, burn it free. I felt involved. In an early part of the game I was laying on the floor crawling past some axe's, much to my wife's amusement. The wand feels great to use, blocking attacks with your sword or shield is cool, but the bow and arrow for me is the stand out weapon in the game. It just felt right.

Sure it's not perfect. Combat feels a little simple. Definitely helps to have a large play area. Mine is fairly large at 2m x 4m and the 2m can cause movement issues. You will find yourself teleporting often just to get where you need to be, but please don't let that put you off. I have played in a 2m x 2m area before I relocated the vive and it still plays fine.

To sum up. Buy this game. If you don't enjoy the genre then walk around the area's and look about. Jaw dropping I feel.

30245778,english,"PROS:
Excellent game and world design give good immersion
Good balance of puzzles, combat and looting
Fun combat both melee and ranged with blocking mechanic
Fun puzzles/challenges that start simple and get harder
Devs seem to be committed to updating and improving
Possibility of open world map in the future has been talked about


CONS:
Bit lacking in the story department text only no real sotry
Short tutorial doesn't teach you much 
Game length needs to be longer or have path choices bit linear
Some of the AI enemies are simple to defeat unless in groups


This is a fantastic VR game and really show cases what the technology is capable of doing at the moment. If you have a nice powerful i7 and GTX 1080 up the supersampling in your Steam VR settings and it's super crisp. Even on my older card before I upgraded this was nice looking and fun to play.

This game really reminds me of the 80s & 90s TV kids game show Knightmare where a team of friends guided a 4th mate through a quest and lots of fun challenges in a computer generated world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare

There is a lot of immersion due to the cool scenery and sound effects and the dungeon setting is modeled very well indeed. I can only imagine in 5 years time the way VR is going we're going to have more games like this featuring multiplayer, playable classes and much bigger open worlds.

Vanishing Realms is essentially a dungeon crawl hack and slash game with combat, looting and puzzles there isn't any real story or character leveling though. You explore a vast dungeon/castle solving puzzles and collecting treasure which allows you to buy various weapons and armour along the way to help fight skeletons and other monsters. Combat is fun featuring melee and ranged but difficulty wise only a few of the enemies are hard.

Think Knightmare mixed with a little bit of Zelda and you have this game!

The combat features blocking and attacking in various ways like stabbing and slashing with range weapons as an option like bows. As I said the combat is not highly skilled by normal RPG standards but it's still very fun and engaging requiring timing to block or dodge attacks. I can only imagine what I must look like in my VIVE swinging my hand around to stab and raising my other hand to block with my shield. The standard enemies are simple enough to beat but the bosses and bigger ones prove more difficult. That said when you encounter more than one enemy at a time it keeps you on your toes.
 
This game has all the usual dungeon crawler puzzles and challenges to workout along the way. The fact the devs added climbing and different movement options recently has made the game better. I'd love to see character classes and more open world stuff added one day.

I initially downloaded a torrent copy but after my first 20 minutes I went and bought it and I am happy to support the developer if they make more games of this standard. The only thing I'll say it's not really a roleplaying game as the story is quite basic in the form of text it would be nice to have some narration perhaps in future updates and a bit more choice of where to go and explore in the form of different paths to complete the game.

I would defiantly say this is one of the best VR games around at the moment and I'm amazed it's early access it feels like a completed game. Some people have complained about play time but the price is just about right at £15.

Most people say this has an average 3-5 hours play time.",76561198130063094,207,79,183,0,169,1589783606,1488307284,1512314082,True,0,0,0.485645711421966553,0,True,False,True

30078119,german,"Hab das Game jetzt in grob 4 Stunden durchgespielt. Nun versuche ich meine Erfahrung so gut es geht zu beschreiben.
Vanishing Realms war eins der ersten VR Games das ich ganz durchgespielt habe im Rythmus 2Std Game/ Pause / 2Std Game.

Die Story

Die Story ist jetzt keine große Überraschung es orientiert sich halt an den guten klasischen Adventure/RPG Games. Untote und ein Held der gegen sie ins Feld zieht und versucht den König der Untoten nieder zu ringen. Man bekommt immer wieder Story und Gamplay wichtige Texte entweder per Sprachausgabe von Steinköpfen die an Wänden hängen, Gegnern oder aus Schriftrollen und Büchern.

Steuerung

Diese wird am Anfang ausreichend erklärt. Jedoch gibt es einige Aspekte die man selber erstmal im Game ausprobieren muss. Besonders positiv finde ich das Inventar was viel zum erleben des Spiels beiträgt. Schneller Wechsel der Waffen und auch gute Inventargröße. Das Teleportieren hilft gerade am Anfang sich an VR zu gewöhnen im Gegensatz zu Titeln wie Yore VR oder Onward. 
Die Motionsickness ist je nach Spieler bei Vanishing Realms abhängig. Mir machte es nach 2 Std nix mehr aus also eine 2/10 für Motionsickness. (Durch das Game wurde auch meine Motionsickness bei Spielen wie Onward besser also Trainingsgame falls ihr Motionsickness anfällig seid)

Spielerlebnis

es gibt viel zu entdecken in Vanishing Realms. Über Geheime Räume bis zu versteckten Gegenständen. Und sogar ein Schatzkarten Rätsel. Es gibt Spitzhacken zum Abbau von Material. Achivment Gegnestände. uvm.
Die Gegner sind unterschiedlich man muss sich einstellen. Es gibt ""Standart Soldaten"", ""Hauptmänner"" , ""Zwischenbosse/Berserker"", Und auch Heiler und Magier. Also für Abwechslung ist gesorgt. 

Gegner sind zwar meist wenig bewegungsfreudig vor allem die Standartgegner aber.... nach einigen Versuchen sie mit nem Bogen zu snipern waren ihre Ausweich Dashes 1a. Auch die Angriffscombos der ""Hauptmänner"" bleiben zwar relativ gleich aber sie haben 2-3 Moves die einen echt in Bedrängnis bringen. Also man brauch schon einen Gewissen Platz um auf die Angriffe zu reagieren. Ich würde die Spielzone definitiv auf 2 x 2 Meter einrichten. Sonst gibts bei stärkeren Gegnern wie z.B Berserker da ihr euch viel bewegt probleme das ihr irgendwo gegen klatscht.

Sound
Sehr stimmig. Es gibt keine Fehler wie fehlende Sounds oder Delays. Die Stimmen die verwendet werden passen sehr gut tragen gut zum erleben dieser Welt bei. 

Grafik

Finde sie erinnert mich vom Aussehen her an Torchlight. Finde sie aber sehr stimmig und passend es gibt 1-2 Sachen die mir aufgefallen sind wo man paar Probleme merkt aber im Gegnsatz zu anderen Early Access Titeln ist das echt zu vergeben. Die Gegner sind schön gestaltet wenn man den Stil mag Und auch Landschaftlich finde ich die Grafik ansprechend. Sonst hätte das Spiel es nicht geschafft mich volle 4 Stunden zu fesseln.

Fazit

Solides Early Access Spiel wenn man sich erstmal in VR zurecht finden muss und erstmal gucken will was die Spiele können. Die 19,99 € sind finde ich gerechtfertigt es kommen ja noch Episoden dazu. Und finde es gibt andere VR Games die Early Access sind und nen Haufen Geld verlangen aber ich finde ungerechtfertigt. 30 - 40 € für paar Level oder sogar nur eins ist ein wenig viel Übertreibung

Also klare Produkt Empfehlung.

29850257,english,"The 1980s were an exciting era when I powered up my PC with the video games Ultima, Bards Tale, and Might and Magic.  late nights and marathon play sessions with my brother through those fantasy adventures forging our heroic tales along the way. 
 
I did not realize it at the time but looking back I think that I had made a sort of deal with the developers of those games.  They were building something that we all desperatly wanted.  They were the first in an emerging technology and art form.   As expected the games were limited by the tech, rough around the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  There needed a forgiving partnership that filled the hours with enjoyment.  I the consumer would contribute to the game as I played.  I would flesh out their stories, fill in the gaps and use my imagination to create things that were not there to imerse myself in the world they created.  

As I play Vanishing Realm I feel like this partnership is a chief requirement to my experience.  Vanishing Realm is once again the realization of a child of the 80s dream.  Like I was so many years ago I find myself needing to fill in the gaps and flesh out the world to make it work.  

Vanishing It is obviously a small project, in an emerging technology, by an indie developer.  As expected it is short in content, rough on the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  If I left it there my sleep-deprived-UltimaIV younger self would die a painful death.  With the short comings aside this game is absolutly a thrill that I have been waiting for years to play.  It is everything I hoped a VR RPG could be, and sets the stage for so much more to come.  This game plucks the heart strings of my 80s inner child.  It is that dream of D&D on the computer and playing in a fantasy world turned into being inside the RPG game.

When I play vanishing realm I see the past, the present and the future at the same time and it is a glorious experience.  I gladly pay the money for what this game is, how it stirs my soul, and what it provides in a glimps to the future.

The full freedom to choose which weapons and/or tools to carry in your hands lets the player choose their own approach. And make mistakes.

The fighting in the game feels good. You can block enemies and hit the vulnerable parts with your weapon. That feels quite natural. When you hit the helmet, shield or weapon of the enemy you don't deal any damage. :D

29582113,english,"Because of the main mode of locomotion being the teleport and most hostiles take more than a few hits, Vanishing Realms give me the impression of what Legend of Grimrock should be in VR if incorporated nicely as a slow paced action fueled RPG.

Main concepts:
- Teleport
- Careful strikes of opponents wth more than a few hits
- Ai dodges attacks, reacts to your controller position but does not engage until in the vicinity of its combat area
(Main reason that gives you a sort of turn based RPG feel)
- Making slow paced/turn based concept to admire the scenery, ambiance and surrounding
- Progress and not free form based inventory, you collect them and fit into an inventory belt
- Puzzles are minor, its more of travelling, clearing zones and figuring out the entire chapter
- Traps, loot and quest items slow you down to appreciate the levels and design of the chapter

As a player of both Grimrock and Skyrim, this seems like a mash up of both. Not as hard core as either as you don't move per block as grimrock with hardcore puzzles nor do enemies come charging at you. You can dodge easily with well timed teleports thus the immersion of full rpg like skyrim is not there along with enemies only being triggered at their areas.

I think this is where vanishing realms shines, it knows the sacrifice it is taking, making gameplay as such, because it wants to deliver exactly what I described above and to be honest, I do prefer to have one RPG reflecting Legend of Grimrock more in VR, and this game is probably it if it had more levels, more intricate stories, more spells, more complex around the chapter puzzles, more bosses, more maps and the ability to combine at least one type of thing, say a rune/gem or crafting certain consumable items or even quest items, might as well add more diverse quest items. All the above is already promised for chapter 2, and the forth coming chapters, so I have no doubt the developers will continue to make it more towards Legend of Grimrock VR than Skyrim VR, which is what it should be.

If you are already a Legend of Grimrock fan and just joined the VR clan, this is definitely your go to before the dev adds more chapters for the fine tuned turn based action rpg that almost mimic systems like DnD into VR, it supports Vive and Oculus, I'm on experimental 360 2 sensors and have the common glitches you'd get from experimental setup, no diff from an oculus game in certain situations",76561198119322387,144,45,339,0,289,1490714314,1485768919,1485768919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ok Vanishing Realms: Impressive, truly, I am blown away by how good this is, I have not completed it yet, I am old and tire easily, can only play for 15 min or so at a time. Tracking is excellent, I have not had any of the issues others have reported. No freezes, no crashing.

Graphically the game is simply beautiful, stylized, but stays true to itself in style, it is easy to suspend disbelief and feel like you are actually there. I am past the huge skeleton with the spiked ball and chain, and have been mining for gold, trying to get enough to afford that wand ( as to how far in I am )

I would gladly have paid $20 for what I have passed already, and will jump at the opportunity to purchase more chapters if they are created. It is the little things that make it so immersive, the fact that hitting a skeleton on his Helmut, or shield does little to no damage, the fact you can parry, they way you can burn straw, or a curtain, the way small things are hidden. Easily one of my top VR experiences now, this is the kind of thing we have been wanting in VR

29135521,english,"Premise:
The epitome of what I wanted to see in a skill-based RPG in VR.  Amazing!

Graphics are crisp and well-defined.
The game itself has some puzzle elements, but nothing too complicated.  (E.G. Figure out how to get to a treasure, Find a key, figure out a riddle, etc)
Skill-based fighting 
- Melee: If your opponent swings high, you block or parry directly on their blade or duck.  Try to counter when you can see something open or just wait for the opportune time
- Ranged:  Using a bow and arrow feels really natural, there's no hiccups trying to grab the bow or nock an arrow, it's simply draw, aim and loose.  Having a ranged battle involves doing some ducking and moving or using short teleports between cover.
- Magic:  Not really implemented (at the time of this review) beyond a wand you'll have to buy during your travels.  It operates much the same as a fired explosive following an arced trajectory.
Great ambiance and fitting mood for the area you're in.
The ending really made you feel like you accomplished something.  Granted, right now there is only one chapter to the game (rite of steel), but it's a pretty long one!
Switching between weapons was a bit cumbersome at times since you have to look down at your belt while you fumble for your weapon.  In a few situations where you're surprised, that's nearly a death sentence.
Combat difficulty scaled as you play through the chapter.  Their moves became more complicated and faster with less hints at which way they would swing.  Overall it was still fairly easy if you have a shield.  Multiple enemies without a shield is pretty much a death sentence.

29025705,english,"Just finished chapters 1 & 2. Some thoughts:

Pros:
- Blocking attacks with the shield or parrying with a sword / hammer / axe is a lot of fun. You can even pretend you're Legolas and dodge arrows, which is really cool. You can also block arrows, which will stick to your shield for a while.
- Enemies are fairly varied. There are lots of variations for the standard sword & shield guys.
- The one really big boss fight towards the end is fun, and will get your blood pumping.
- You not only get melee weapons, but bows and a magic wand as well.
- You can finally mine rocks in VR :P
- You can dual wield swords, or a combination of other weapons.
- There is a 2-handed axe, which is interesting to use.

Cons:
- Swordplay is not nearly as tight as it could be. Actually landing hits on enemies can be.. Hit and miss. Their hitboxes are pretty bad, in my opinion. When you get used to it and don't flail about like an idiot though (like I tend to do) - it's not too bad.
- Maybe I just suck, but using the bow well is very hard. I'll add that I have no problems whatsoever in the archery demo in The Lab (played that one quite a bit).
- Teleportation. I personally dislike this; probably because I don't get motion sick when playing games with analog movement.
- Backtracking is a pain because of the teleportation movement system. Oh, how I wish devs would implement alternative control schemes. The touch pads on the Vive controllers would be just fine for moving forwards and back. The Oculus Touch controllers are probably even better for this.

Summary (TLDR):

 If the devs read this, Really good job guys. This is a truly good game. Two thumbs up for a game that i could not put down. If I could as per request highs, lows and bugs

Highs: Smooth gameplay and graphics, Excellent use of money to buy swords, bows, and magic, A likeable story with a hint of mystery. (not all the highs but just wanted to be concise.)

Lows: Limited to one type of magic, HUD is kinda wonky with the moving as you turn your head ( found it difficult to put things in my pocket), no way to cancel spell from wand ( killed myself a few times trying to put it back in my pocket lol), and if at all possible can you make the shields of the enemys breakable ( have low tear guys have very easly broken shields and higher end guys more difficult to break.)

Bugs: Im not a games des or dev so im not sure what to look for in the realm of ""bugs"" maybe a couple of clipping issues buts thats all i got.

28911659,english,"From the moment you start the game to how intuitive the ""interface"" is, this game is both beautiful, immersive, fun and awesome.  If you wanted to experience an adventure, solve puzzles and fight monsters, this is the game for you.

Sound/Graphics:
To me, I love the style and how everything in the game looks.  They style is kind of cartoony and it works really well for this game.  There is a ""level"" or area inside of a crypt that is flooded and from the water dripping to the echos of distant noises plus the need to use a torch to help with the darkness, this game really hits the mark.  In areas where you are exploring outside, you can hear the crickets chirp whil looking at the dark moon light things up.  It is a beautifully well done game and an amazing VR experience

Interface:
The developer really hit a home run on this one.  From the moment I jump inot the game, everything is very intuitive and self explainitory.  There is a tutorial level to get you going for new users but I would love to see this type of interfacing as the norm for adventure games.  Pulling items from your inventory, dropping and movement is extremely simple and really helps you to forget that you are in a game.  The simplicity really helps with immersion combined with the sound and the graphics, I really felt like I was in this world, even after taking off the VR headset.  Well done!

Gameplay:
I have read people compare this to Zelda type games, which is one way to describe it.  the way I see it is, if you took an old school point and click adventurgame like Lucas Arts or the old Sierra games, converted it to a 3D VR space and added additional elements of combat, this is Vanishing Realms.  It was so fun to play (I spent about 3 hours from start to finish trying to explore every nook and cranny) there are so many ""hidden"" things to do in this game from looking in the hollow part of a log to find treasure to solving riddles and finding solutions to progress to other areas.  This aspect is very immersive and fun.  I caint wait to see more from this game and I hope other adventrue games follow suit with Vanishing Realms

Combat:
Combat is split into two categories, melee and ranged and I must say, I was pretty impressed by the combat and the AI.  In melee, you may get a few hits in if you start randomly swinging at a monster, but they block, set back and move out of your way so you can't use that as a go to strategy.  The different monsters do have patterns and once you figure it out (by watching how they hold their sword, and if you react quick enough, you can easily defeat the monsters.  It takes time to learn this, makinc one on one combat a joy... that leads to much more challenging scenarios when you face multiple opponents at the same time.  You really need to look and block and move and avoid being surrounded in order to win otherwise they will chop you up like diced tomatoes ;) this is where you need group based combat strategies... i.e. move arround your opponents and do not get surrounded... you can also use other enemies to help kill each other.  I was fighing a Giant skeleton, who has a ball and chain type weapon with a few other skeleton creatures facing me.  I would manuver myself between a smaller skeleton and the swining ball and chain from the giant one, and have him crush my opponents for me. It was fun and you have to try it :) you can also pick between dual wield, sword and shield and two handed weapons, which really change up how you play and works great in different scenarios.

Ranged combat is well though out and I really felt like I was pulling back on a bow.  If you try to shoot monsters from a distance, they will move or block and, while you have unlimited arrows, it can be pretty challenging to bring a creature down that is protected and is moving out of your way.  Using the terrain around you to protect from incoming projectiles was another fun and tactical way to deal with enemies from a distance that were shooting back at you.  I know I spent more time on melee combat but doing things like shooting apples from a tree, cutting wires with my arrows to give me access to a bridge or shooting pesky mage ghosts as fireballs streak past me... this was insanley fun.

Over all:
Get this game, you will not be disappointed :)

28841838,english,"This was the second VR game I had purchased after Space Pirate Simulator, and was one of the better first forays into the RPG adventure side of things (the other one being Spell Fighter, a clunky free vr game)

What did I like:

The art style visually pleasing and doesn't get in your face.

Sword and shield mechanics feel fluid, but with some issues (see below)

Archery was clean, for the most part, but also had some issues (see below)

Most of the environment is interactable. There's a section in game where there were a number of ore clusters around, and I was wondering if I would be able to mind them later on. Sure enough, a few areas later I found a few pickaxes.

Puzzles were challenging, but didn't make me want to take the headset off and quit.


What I didn't like:

Presently in game, there's an auto-pause feature. This may have been more of an issue with my cobbled settup, but I was experiencing the auto-pause going off a lot during combat and exploration, despite me not going out of sight of my base stations. I tried turning it off, but whenever I did go out of range of my base stations I got pwnt by the enemies.

Combat is good for the most part, but hit detection needs a lot of work. I managed to complete both chapters, but not without combat grinding to a halt because of auto-pauses, or constantly having to flail and reposition due to the auto-pause throwing my character out of position, and rendering me unable to hit anything.

Call me a noob, but I was having extreme issues with archery at long range. There's a section where you need to fight a skeleton wizard, a skeleton cleric, and a skeleton juggernaught. Attacking the fire wizard or the juggernaut doesn't work because the cleric  heals them. Trying to dodge fireballs and hit the cleric repetedly was almost impossible due to how archery works. I wish there was a proper sight on the bow, or at least something to assist with aim.

Later on in game you have the opertunity to gain a two-handed axe as a weapon. While it deals good damage, I found myself going back to my battleworn sword that was dealing less damage due to the outright clunkyness of the mechanics. Again, this may have been an issue with my settup rather than a game issue.

Inventory management for weapons was something that I almost tore my hair out at. Trying to swap from sword to axe, or vice versa, was a trial in patience, since if you click on the axe with your sword equiped, it causes them to stack rather than swap. I ended up getting hit a lot because I was trying to swap to my sword, and ended up stacking it on top of the axe, leaving my unarmed in my main hand, rather than swapping to the proper weapon.



All in all, Vanishing Realms is a good game, but it does suffer from issues that can be solved with a bit more polish, and a bit more work setting up your play area.

28840928,english,"This has been my favorite VR game to play so far. The ambiance in the game makes you feel like you're really alone in a dark magic world. A big part of that feeling comes from the ambient noises and music. Deep rumbling, droning noises, and occasionally noises from monsters in rooms nearby as you creep around. It's not a horror game but it will make you jump sometimes as a skeleton pops out of something unexpectedly.

The combat in the game is fun even though getting used to teleporting in combat is a little weird at first. I especially liked the enemy arhcers because it was unnerving seeing their arrows flying right at your face. I liked the rush as your instinct kicked in to prevent you from getting an arrow shot through your face because your brain didn't know it was only VR. I would have liked the enemies to be a bit more agressive in chasing me. I haven't tried the hard mode yet, maybe they do then?

Mining wasn't something I was expecting to see in this game but was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of future potential here. Resource gathering and crafting would be cool. Another interesting concept to see in VR was the destroyable object: burning or smashing things to find hidden items. Lastly, some items were in plain sight but required solving a puzzle or finding a clever way to knock it down. I found myself picking up candles and throwing them at the ceiling knocking down goblets. Lots of fun.

28756682,english,"Put simply, this is a truly amazing and super fun game for VR.

I won't comment on the full content, as to me this is part of the experience while playing this game which represents the most you can expect. And that's the first and only negative aspect I see for this game: The overall play time you'll get for paying 20€. The first playthrough (Nearly non-stop, I just had to sleep and eat something on occasion..) provided me with nearly 4 hours of fun. A few euros less and you'll get a very polished and well made game for your bucks. Since I got this game during Steam's Winter Sale it cost me 14€ which looks like a reasonal price to me. But this is nitpicking. Paying more than that just helps the developer to provide us with a third chapter.

And this what I'm looking for. The third chapter. Or put simply, again, MOOAR content!

- I want to smash bigger and more challenging creatures (Though, I have yet to play this game on ""Hard"" and fighting against multiple opponents IS already challenging!).
- I want more stories which evolve the same way as the one from the first chapter. (And please, again using rimes which match the atmosphere so well!)
- I want more (bigger?) items to throw around, maybe even ones you can utilize in combat. (Throwing a bottle at the enemy and then set him on fire using a torch...)
- I want more magic. One wand is not enough. (Though there's magic, after all!)

For those who still hesitate:

- You really need the required play space. I played the game on a 3.2mx1.7m space and if I had not only a couch which limits me to 1.7m but a solid wall I guess I already had to buy a new motion controller after the first fight. If not after the first 1 vs 1, then definitely after the first 1 vs 2 engagement.
- The graphics are not what you'll see in the usual games today. It's rather a more modern Spyro or any similar jump'n'run from the past, graphic wise. But it's not the graphics what makes truly great games great! And that's even more the fact for this game.
- The teleportation system works very well. It's not like in other games or ""demos"" and limits you how far you can teleport in a nice way. I can't properly describe it, but it just works and does not feel that different than using your own feet. And since the required play space is already fairly big, you'll have enough chances to use your own feet nonetheless.
- It's VR. Put simply. ;-)

THIS GAME IS FREEKING AMAZING.  

Its what anyone who has been dreaming about VR gaming could hope for in a VR game.  

If this were a normal game it would be a very forgettable dungeon crawler several years out of date.  Its not though, its a true VR game with a excellent interface, responsive controls, puzzles which are not very hard but very interesting in VR, and the fact I can have a real sword fight with a armored skeleton is fantastic.  I was surprised I even had to properly swing to get a two handed axe to work right and I'm blocking with the shaft intuitively.  

I also learned a valuable lesson.  Unlike a regular game, its totally not worth picking up every gold coin on the ground and smashing EVERY pot or box.  I only just quit playing because after several fights with the 2h axe, I was getting a bit sweaty, and I'm not an out of shape gamer. 

Basically if you own a Vive, you MUST get this.  I'm not sure why it didn't show up for me in a VR search on steam, (found it via google), this should be shipped with the Vive as a package its so good.

Side note, my room is pretty small, the Vive minimum, and I'm under the recommended size for this game but the games UI is good enough that its never been an issue. 

If I could make one small suggestion, I would allow for drawing/sheathing motions from the back and hip for swords, bows, etc.

(constructive) criticism: 

1) The checkpoint system is not entirely intuitive. I left a chest to come back to later, and it was gone when I returned (apparently because my progress marked that section as 'cleared' in the save or something?)  It was never quite clear what would be saved and what wouldn't.

Ideally I'd like to be able to save whenever I want (VR sessions in particular often need to be much shorted than 'normal' PC gaming).

I have time to read - A really good game. I wish I had played it before Arizona Sunshine, then I would have rated it as an excellent game. Playtime approx 2hrs and I don't think I missed much (got all the chalices and shot half the apples off the trees)

Although the gfx are cartoon there is a lot of good stuff in this game. Looting, Mining and setting fire to just about everything that looks like it will burn. The story is good and well thought out and the devs have turned a dungeon crawl into something compelling to play for 2hrs. The AI is not completely stupid as in other sword fighing titles. They back off, have a variety of attacks, dodge arrows and even push you back if you get too close (Bone Hulk). So all in all, good. As for the fighting, be careful you don't need to swing wildly and well timed, aimed strikes will enable you to take out your opponents quicker and with ease. The bow/arrow are good and the collision detection is excellent. The two handed poleaxe is... well, a little unwieldy as you would expect a 2H poleaxe. If you keep good distance its fine, but lacks the precision of the sword.

I would like to see the devs expand this to include some spellcraft (casting runes in order to throw magic) and maybe multiplayer co-op.

* SPOILER ALERT BELOW *




The only down side I found was that, as a cautious fighter, I entered most large areas with caution, the mobs spawn and I can then pepper them with arrows from range and they didn't advance on me. In the show down with the king I took out all the mobs and half the kings health from just inside the door way with my bow/wand. Note to devs: Maybe don't allow me unlimited arrows. Put a quiver size of 50 arrows and allow me to collect from fallen enemies. That way I have to be more tactical in my engagement with the mobs.

28477952,german,"VR Review für die HTC-Vive

Nun muss ich doch einmal sagen: Ich habe mich in mein erstes VR-Spiel verliebt. Wegen der Hoffnung auf solche Spiele habe ich mir eine VR-Brille zugelegt. 

Hier werden die Möglichkeiten von VR in tollen Situationen aufzeigt, an welche ich noch immer zurückdenken muss. Z.B. wenn man sich zum ersten mal bei einem PC Spiel dabei ertappt, wie man sich auf den Boden legt, um durch tödliche Fallen hindurchzurobben und einen Schatz zu bergen oder sich kurz aus der Deckung herauswagt, seinen gespannten Pfeil abfeuert und wieder hinter der Ecke versteckt. 
Bei schwereren Gegnern kommt man tatsächlich außer Puste und turnt wie ein Irrer durch das Wohnzimmer, um Schlägen auszuweichen und eigene zu platzieren. 
Das alles ist eingebettet in eine handgebaute wundervoll atmosphärisch düstere Welt, welche sowohl Innen- als auch Außenareale bietet, die  liebevoll gestaltet wurden und erst durch das Roomscaling richtig zum Leben erwachen. Die Grafik ist hübsch anzusehen und wirkt sehr immersiv. 
Im Kampf gegen die verschiedenen Gegnerarten hat man unterschiedliche Waffen, welche man nach und nach gegen gesammeltes Gold eintauschen kann, das an den unterschiedlichsten Orten versteckt ist in Form von Münzen, Pokalen und Edelsteinen. 
Gesteuert wird das Ganze mit den Vive-Controllern, wobei jeder Controller einen Arm darstellt, sodass man beispielsweise Schwert und Schild halten kann, oder eben beispielsweise einen beidhändigen Bogen. 
Wenn man es sich einfach machen will, dann kann man Gegner recht mühelos mit dem Bogen ausschalten, da die Gegner eine schlechte Wegfindung haben und sich quasi überhaupt nicht an den Spieler annähern. Daher entwickelt das Spiel seine wirkliche Stärke im Nahkampfsystem, wenn man Gegner mit dem Schild oder Schwert pariert und dann zum Gegenangriff auf ungeschützte Stellen ausholt, oder den Gegner umtänzelt und von der Seite angreift. Die Gegner greifen zur Zeit relativ langsam an, was dennoch sehr viel Spaß bereitet. 
Seit dem letzten Update gibt es jedoch einen Hardcore Modus, welcher dafür sorgen soll, dass die Gegner den Spieler verfolgen, schnelller attackieren, Hiebe gezielt parieren und Combos einsetzen. Getestet habe ich das bisher noch nicht. Außerdem wird das Spiel durch Updates um neue Areale erweitert, welche auchim normalen Modus verfügbar sind. 

Die Sendeboxen sollten für dieses Spiel gut ausgerichtet sein, damit sie die Controller auch in geduckter Haltung und an möglichst jeder Ecke des Spielbereichs einfangen können, da sonst die Verbindung abbrechen kann. Den vom Spiel voreingestellten automatischen Pause-Modus für diesen Fall kann man im Spielmenü deaktivieren, was ich jedem empfehlen würde, da die Controller in der Regel sofort wieder gefunden werden und man meistens nichts davon mitbekommt. Die Präzision im Kampf ist beeindruckend, sodass man wirklich das glaubt die Wucht eines abgewehrten Schlages zu spüren. 
Die Fortbewegung geschieht mittels Teleportation oder freiem Bewegen im verfügbaren Raum. Das Teleportieren wirkt dabei nicht störend, Motion Sickness war bei mir ebenfalls kein Problem, wobei ich auch relativ unempflindlich dafür bin. 

Zum Spielumfang kann ich noch nicht viel sagen. Ich habe es noch nicht durchgespielt und zudem befindet es sich ja noch im Early Acces Modus. Dennoch bekommt man bereits jetzt ein toll ausgearbeitetes Spiel, welches manch bisher noch nicht erlebtes Spielgefühl aufkommen lässt und den Preis meiner Meinung nach vollkommen rechtfertigt.

Some minor issues though but understandable for early access such as a bit of flicker when teleporting, very minor though and doesn't really detract from the game overall.

Some suggestions for improvement:

- Give us the ability to chose movement! Thought teleporting is ok for some, I personally can handle moving my car using the thumbsticks and don't get motion sickness.  Let us move normally would be a huge benefit to this game for me and I'd love it even more.
- Ability to turn on the spot without physically turning around - partly with the above movement, but often I find I'm facing all sorts of directions in some areas and I end up losing tracking (only 2 sensors but getting 3rd soon).  This would help if full movement couldn't be done.

28379768,english,"I'm fairly new to the Vive and VR in general. Being a fan of RPGs, all signs pointed to Vanishing Realms as being the game of choice. Several minutes in and I wasn't disappointed. This immersive environment, while having a slightly cartoonish, Dragon's Lair-type quality, was extremely fluid and believable. While it doesn't have the same level of interactivity of games like ES:Skyrim, there is enough to keep you conscious of your environment (it's easy to set your floor on fire if you carry that torch too low!).  

I was extremely skeptical of the system of movement (teleporting) at first. Quickly I realized that with even a marginal play area, the mechanics worked very well. Being in the habit of smashing every container in site and wrecklessly grabbing every item in site with a mouse point or controller, the realistic action of picking up every item/coin/treasure and placing it in a ""pocket"" added a fun level of realism that made me appreciate the difficulty of being a ""hero"". 

Combat is simplistic, and yet precise all at the same time. There is a variety of weaponry, but I was fairly disappointed that there were no real physics or damage differences (that I was aware of) based on the weapon type (bashing hammer damage vs. slashing sword damage). I found the ability to duck and dodge while conducting archery combat to be extremely entertaining. The enemies become a little simplistic once you've gained some familiarity with the system, but the combinations present a challenge and keep things fresh.

The game has an intensity to it, when entering unknown caverns and labyrinths, that is completely lost in standard PC/Console gaming. Peeking shyly around corners, uncertain as to what surprise may lurk there. The sweat of actual combat! Hacking and slashing at a horde and wondering if maybe retreat is the right decision!

Overall, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms! It's a quick playthrough and I'm anxious for additional content! The possibilities are incredibly exciting and worth the investment.

Once you learn the control conventions the game uses, everything just works as you think it should. For example, the triggers grab. If I grab an item with the wrong hand (maybe I grab an item I want to throw with my off-hand), I just put the other controller on the held item and click that controller's trigger.

28257190,english,"I just finished the first chapter of Vanishing Realms and wanted to leave the developer some feedback...

First, my hardware specifications are:
   OS:  Windows 10 Pro
   Processor:  i7-4790 @ 3.60GHz
   RAM:  16 GB
   GU:  Radeon RX 480
   VR:  HTC Vive, Game Area 2m x 1.8m (Just Under Requirement)

I received my HTC Vive a few days ago and have, like many I suspect, gone into a frenzy downloading and trying out VR content.  I've had lots fun and been amazed with The Blue and delighted with Google Earth, as well as numerous other titles.  I am 100% sold on VR, and am excited to begin my own development for the Vive platform.  (I'm an old software developer by profession.)

One of the titles that kept popping up online when I searched for top rated VR content was Vanishing Realms.  I was hesitant at the price at first, however, as I've discovered that there is a lot of content that, quite honestly, isn't enjoyable.  But, I'm a big ""sword & sorcery"" fan and Vanishing Realms gets lots of good reviews, so I paid my $20.00 and...  Promptly forgot all about it.

A couple days later (yesterday, in fact) I was looking through my growing VR content library and saw that Vanishing Realms was in there.  I fired it up and put on the Vive headset.  That was a mistake...  I had a list of chores to do around the house and didn't get to any of them.

The first thing I noticed about Vanishing Realms was how polished it was, compared to other experiences I had sampled.  The Vanishing Realms menu system was very intuitive and responsive.  I often see some frame drops when using the Vive, but noticed none while playing Vanishing Realms.  I was worried that the somewhat ""cartoon"" (versus photo-realistic) graphics would detract from the experience, but I ended up really liking the graphics.  (The ""monsters"" were realistic enough to cause me to jump back in exclamation on more than one occasion!)  I'm afraid that trying to go too photo-realistic with the graphics would result in frame loss which would ultimately detract from the virtual reality experience rather than add to it.

The game's audio is great and really helped define the game's atmosphere, whether it be the sound of wind blowing, the crackle of a torch, or the clang of sword on sword.

I was already somewhat familiar with the ""blink"" movement system from playing with The Lab, where it works very well.  It works equally well in Vanishing Realms, although, at times, it can make some combat ""too easy.""  An arrow coming at you?  Just blink over a bit to dodge it.  Fighting a nasty creature hand-to-hand?  Blink in, hit, and blink out.  During gameplay, to ""even the odds,"" I tried to force myself not to blink too much in combat, as it seems like cheating in some way.

Speaking of movement, my play area is slightly smaller than the required 2m x 2m (I'm at 2m x 1.8m or so).  This did hamper my ability to reach certain items -- I would have to physically back up to the edge of my play area, and then blink closer to the object to be able to reach it.  This isn't the fault of the developer, however, and I am enlarging my play space which, I suspect, will solve this issue.  Also related to my smaller than required play space, sometimes, in the heat of ""battle,"" I would step out of bounds which paused the game, causing a brief ""disruption"" of the virtual reality play experience.

I really like the inventory system in Vanishing Realms.  I like that it takes a moment to fumble around switching weapons in the face of an enemy -- it's much more realistic than just clicking a button on a control pad to switch from bow to sword.

As mentioned previously, I paid just at $20 for the game.  After playing the first chapter I consider my $20 very well spent.  When compared to the cost of going to see a movie (which lasts only a couple of hours), the cost for Vanishing Realms appears to be a bargain.  I would be willing to pay for additional chapters and/or expansions upon my completion of the game.

All in all, I don't have many complaints regarding Vanishing Realms.  Sure, I wish there was MORE (more levels, more monsters, more scenes, etc.), but, again, the game is only $20 (compared to $60 I've spent for Xbox One games).  I also wish that the game was more difficult, but I understand that it needs to be accessible to a large audience and not just hard-core ""swashbucklers"" like me.  As it is, I know that my 11-year old son will enjoy the game without getting frustrated that he is getting killed every scene. 

All in all, I highly recommend the game and can't wait to play the next chapter.  I will also be keeping an eye out for updates and additional titles from the developer.",76561198188697017,122,10,302,0,212,1512838876,1481220792,1481220792,True,12,0,0.6530112624168396,0,True,False,True

The vivid lighting effects & majestic God rays are a sight to behold & made me stop on more than one occasion to take them in. The teleporting nature of gameplay feels good and controls become intuitive almost immediately. Shooting the bow is especially addictive & fun.  Just be sure you have a generous amount of space to play.  My space barely met the minimum requirement which I suspect created a fair amount of tracking issues.  Turning off the pause screen feature was helpful.  Buy this game now, just make sure you have some extra room on the minimum allowable space so your controls don't go haywire.

I consider Vanishing Realms a must have for VR today, especially for anyone who enjoys classical RPG's.

pros:
- art direction is perfect, looks great!
- world interaction a plenty, you will be smashing and burning to find coins hidden in just about every nook and cranny
- combat done very well, every battle feels intense and important 
- locomotion is designed for all users, teleportation with a 'stamina' style mechanism to prevent moving too far too fast
- inventory is the best ive seen, VR or flat, items go in your belt. simple 
- you hit rocks with a pickaxe 

cons (I struggled to find any real cons here):
- If you are used to open-world, this fairly linear experience might not satisfy (but there is plenty of exploring to do)
- some very minimal narrative - leaves you feeling a little bit 'aimless' in why exactly you are exploring this dungeon/world

关于这个款消失的国度，整体来讲是不错的，我想从3各方面来说：
1.游戏的画面：游戏画面很清晰，没有卡帧的情况，游戏的沉浸感也是很棒的；
2.游戏设置方面：这是一款冒险解密类游戏，前期你可能会觉得没有太大的意思，需要找各种东西去解锁，还要存钱买箭，但是当你到后期的时候，你就会发现会有格斗，厮杀的场面，尤其在和怪物的打斗，还是很需要技巧的，总体来说还是比较比错的；
3.游戏本身：这款游戏刚开始的时候会让你觉得无聊，所以个人建议可以初始带一点轻武器类的，让玩家边打怪边解密就不会显得前面太单一，这样玩家的沉浸感也会更好。
4.关卡的设置：在关卡的设置上面作者也是用心良苦，会让你在捡宝物的时候，突然受的攻击，真的是送你吃蜜枣又问你要钱的感觉啊！！！

teleporting and room scale (impossible to rotate the room as far as i know, so pretty annoying sometimes)

[b]Lenght: [/b]
The game is quite short: i took me 2 hours completing it and exploring and getting all the chalice (now I have to do it in hard mode)

[b]Replayability:[/b]
Once you completed it once, I really do not see the point of re-doing it, as it will be exactily the same, they could have implemented chapter 2 with infinite waves.

Chapter 1 it's pretty nice, chapter 2 it's a really not a chapter but more 10-15 minutes of games where you have 9 waves of monster to defeat, really zero point.

[b]In terms of story:[/b]
there is no story in the game, or almost null, the few sentences you encounter are regarding a specific loot you can get or guide you to the next objective. it's a pity that there is no voice over at least on those few sentences.

Graphics are as you see in the screenshot, I personally like the style.

[b]Cons:[/b]
seeing the last update from the dev, even if it's still in early access, the game won't change much, and all additional content will be a paid DLC.

Wasn't expecting that from an early access game of still being on early access but working on next paid content.

26569321,english,"What a great experience. One of the best games for the Vive so far, and the best VR RPG hands down. Can't wait for the next installments.

It's short, but not too short. You won't get through it in a single session, most likely it will take several, depending on your VR stamina.

Pros:

- Great use of the Vive with some interesting mechanics that play out really well, like throwing things to knock treasures off of high ledges, and the utility belt approach to inventory.

- Several weapon choices that offer different playstyles for each one, from the sword & board, to the bow, to the dragon wand (nuclear option), and a couple of others. This lends some replayability to the game that otherwise might not be there... I want to replay it just to master the 2-handed battle axe, which is probably the toughest weapon to master in the game. Not due to poor design, it just takes some practice to get right, and your first time through you'll probably gravitate to the easier weapons.

- Well-balanced gameplay. The difficulty seems appropriate at each level of the game, and it's never too easy or hard. By the time you hit the trials, you'll be swashbuckling and teleporting like it's second nature, but you'll still need to be fast on your feet while staying on top of your situational awareness to win.

- It's got some flavor. Just the simple act of lighting all the candles and torches you find is deeply satisfying (plus there's an achievement for it). There's some treasure that's pretty well hidden too, look absolutely everywhere. Burn stuff. Shoot apples.

- Combat is very fulfilling. Some of the enemies are downright tough, and order some replacement foam rings right now, because you're going to break a sweat. Sidestep to flank, teleport behind, low shot under the shield, duck and cover, come over the top with the battle axe... all valid tactics, and you're going to want to use them.

- No stability problems or gameplay issues. Smooth and easy.

- You haven't lived until you've dodged a fireball three inches from your face.

Not much in the way of Cons, but I'll try:

- It's linear. As mentioned before, the various weapons offer different playstyles for each, but essentially there is nothing procedural or random about the game. However, the overall experience is enough fun that I'll play it through a few more times anyway.

- ALMOST too short, but I'm going to give Indimo a hall-pass here because, relatively speaking, it's the most fulfilling RPG out there so far IMO. They have also laid the groundwork for some really playable (and replayable) mechanics that I hope to see more of in future releases.

- Some of the lore poetry is pretty hokey.

All in all, with the state of the art as it is, Vanishing Realms is an absolute must-buy, and hopefully soon turns into a franchise that I'll be sticking with for the duration.

Highly recommended 9.5/10.",76561197995116375,504,5,441,0,116,1573967509,1478991800,1478991800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Alors, commencons par l'état de cet early acces:
C'est bien optimisé vu que les graphismes sont plus du coté de la wii que d'un PC de derniere generation. Pas de lag, un framerate constant (obligé pour ne pas voir de cinétose) qui rendent l'aventure agréable.
Le gameplay est facile à prendre en main tout en ayant certaines petites difficultés. Il vous fraudra part moment jeter des objets à des endroits bien précis et ca ne sera pas chose facile! Les armes sont intuitives et repondent de maniere trés naturelle. Le déplacement se fait par le biais de téléportations (déplacement que j'apprécie avec la VR mais pas le plus immersif) mais le roomscale est bien pris en compte (on se voit faire des pas de cotés pour éviter les fleches énnemies).

Le jeu en lui même:
C'est un dungeon crawler ou un jeu comme Zelda pour les anglophobes. On y parcourt un dongeon (pour le moment vu qu'il n'y a que les 2 premiers chapitres) avec quelques zones en extérieur. C'est fun, les differentes enigmes sont simples et les combats assez rudimentaires mais trés instinctifs.",76561197967549400,2037,10,342,0,305,1543525949,1478974229,1511379341,True,2,0,0.504950523376464844,0,True,False,True
26563726,english,"I just finished the first two chapters of this game. This game is great. It is not perfect but it still a great game to have on VR. I'm excited to see what is in store for the rest of the game. There are pointless parts of the game. In the game, you get three swords. The problem with that? You get the second one at the same time as the third unless you backtrack. There is no reason to use the second one. There is a second shield but I could not tell you why it is better than the first.

I would suggest you have a massive play area to use this. I have 2.5m x 2.5m space and this is too small, way too small. I recommend 3m x 3m or larger. Also, you will be moving around quite a bit when using this game. Make sure your headphones are on secure.

As far as suggested features, co-op multiplayer would make it amazing. A training mode would be awesome or just a mode to mess around with all of the weapons. Overall, I would give this a 4/5. The game works fairly well. I haven't seen any bugs but it does feel like an early access. If you want an awesome VR game, I suggest you pick this up.

My reasoning was that combat and puzzles are both too easy.   Puzzles in this game add up to simple fetch-object-from-a-few-feet-away-and-bring-back-to-other-object moments.  These puzzles required no thinking and were just boring.  Yes, it's VR, so it's very immersive, but that will only get you so far!  Picking up objects felt good, and throwing objects played into some puzzles, which was kind of clever, but that really wasn't required to progress through any portion of the game, which was already pretty short.  It was also very unoptimized and ran very slowly at times for unknown reasons.  I mean, VR is demanding, but NRAN runs much more smoothly and has much more going on (including emulators and minigames and more realistic lighting/shading), so I'm disappointed with this game's performance by comparison.

Man wird voll in die virtuelle Welt gezogen und vergisst Zeit und Raum (OK...auf den Raum wird man ständig hingewiesen wenn man der Chaparone zu nahe kommt :) ).
Wenn man RPGs, Fantasy und (leichte) Rätsel mag ein Pflichtkauf !
Wunderbare Mechanik, für meinen Begriff ein ausreichender Grafikstil (ist wie bei vielen anderen Spielen...dem einen gefällts, dem anderen ists zu ""simpel"") und eine top Athmosphäre - wobei etwas mehr Sprachausgabe ganz nett wäre.

Die Kritiken der Negativbewerter finde ich teilweise nicht gerechtfertig oder evtl. veraltet (ist ja Early Access und wird laufend optimiert). Bei mir könnte man z.B. die ""Chaperone-Hauptmenü-Funktion"" mittlerweile auf Wunsch deaktivieren.
Das Thema Fortbewegung ist auch eher geschmackssache - ich z.B. mag teleportieren weil ich an Motion Sickness leide bei Games wie z.B. Hover Junkers.
Über zu kurzen bzw. zu wenig Content zu meckern bei einem Game im Early Access finde ich auch fraglich...wer weiss denn was da noch kommt...

First of all, I start this review with the same words as I have done before: English is not my native language. Sorry for stupid mistakes sometimes...

Ok, what do we like in VR game? Yes, interaction and immersion! In this game you have both on so high level that I couldn't imagine before that it's even possible...

This game has the most responsive and awesome combat system. You have to parry, dodge, block enemies' attacks and counter them when they are open. You totally understand when you hit and you get hit. It's so simple, so intuitive and so good!

Interaction with the environment is one of the best! You can burn the leaves on the floor with your torch, you can move and break most of the objects to find some coins or goodies, you can even jump and disrupt the apple from the tree and eat it!!! Next level immersion, guys! Next level...

I can write a lot of warm words about this game and make a lot of compliments... But I just want to hug the game developers and say a HUGE THANK YOU guys! You did a great job!

26304507,german,"Nach den ""äußerst positiven"" Bewertungen habe ich mich für dieses Spiel entschieden. Leider wurde ich enttäuscht.

=======================
Warum ich das Spiel nicht mag:
=======================

(-) Die Kämpfe machen mir persönlich wenig Spaß. Grund: Die Künstliche Intelligenz der Gegner ist sehr schlicht. Selbst Bossgegner stehen immer wieder einfach da und können problemlos aus der Entfernung mit Pfeil und Bogen abgeschossen werden. In anderen Situationen (Nahkampf) funktionieren Kämpfe aber wie gewünscht und machen dann auch Spaß.

(-) Zur Fortbewegung muss man sich in kleinen Schritten durch sehr große Areale teleportieren. Problem: Ständiges Teleportieren ist suboptimal. Es bringt einen aus der Spielwelt, da der Kopf ab einer gewissen Häufigkeit die Umgebung als ""nicht real"" wahrnimmt. Wären die Areale anders gestaltet, würden sich die Teleports pro Zeiteinheit reduzieren. Andere Titel machen das besser. 

(-) Der Höhepunkt des Spiels ist eine kleine Arena. Diese muss man schätzungsweise acht mal durchlaufen, um das Spiel zu knacken. Das Schema ist dabei immer gleich. Beim 3. mal war ich der Arena leider bereits überdrüssig.

(-) Ich habe sehr langsam gespielt und komme auf eine Spielzeit von knapp 3 Stunden. Sehr wenig für 20€, zumal auch viel Leerlauf und Wiederholungen dazwischen sind (=>Arena).

(-) Das Inventar ist fummelig und dort platziert, wo in der echten Welt der Bauch wäre. Problem: Es ist immer am unteren Linsenrand --> Das Inventar ist grundsätzlich unscharf, da außerhalb des Sweet Spots. Das strengt die Augen an.

(-) Schwertkämpfe funktionieren auf zwei Arten: Man tut was das Spiel von einem will, oder man fuchtelt einfach wild und ohne Ziel rum. Leider funktioniert beides.

(-) Wenige Gegnertypen mit wenig ""Charakter"". Die einzige Sprachausgabe in diesem Spiel ist ""hoooooh"". Das geben Gegner von sich wenn sie zuschlagen.

(-) Es existiert leider keine nennenswerte Story abseits von englischen Texttafeln.

==================
Was am Spiel positiv ist:
==================

(+) Die Schwertkämpfe machen durchaus Spaß

(+) Bogenschießen annähernd wie bei ""The Lab"" umgesetzt.

(+) Man kann eine Spitzhacke finden, mit der man Kristalle, Edelsteine abbauen kann. Das macht so lange Spaß bis man merkt, dass es im ganzen Spiel vielleicht 10 Stellen gibt, wo man diese einsetzen kann.

(+) Mancher schöne Aha-Moment im Spiel für Leute mit noch wenig VR Erfahrung.

(+) Es ist ein VR Spiel

Fazit:
=====

Ohne Virtual Reality wäre dieses Spiel wohl nicht relevant. Umfang gering, Grafikstil recht austauschbar, viele Designmacken. Virtual Reality macht daraus dann eine interessante Erfahrung, die aber ausbaubar ist. An anderer Stelle (Rec Room -> Mittelalter zB) hatte ich deutlich mehr Spaß für weniger Geld pro Spielzeit.",76561197966654329,215,4,232,0,128,1512688391,1477789356,1500597066,False,6,0,0.491596639156341553,4,True,False,True

26288259,german,"Dies ist eine klare Empfehlung. Vanishing Realms ist das erste Vive-Spiel, das ich gespielt habe und das keine Tech-Demo ist oder nach 1h langweilig wird. Den Reviews auf Steam bei VR-Games traue ich schon lange nicht mehr. Alle scheinen immer sofort begeistert zu sein, aber haben meistens nicht mehr als 1h gespielt. Natürlich ist der erste Eindruck meistens wirklich bombastisch (ist halt VR), aber der Spielspaß läßt oft schnell nach. Das ist bei Vanishing Realms anders. Dazu komme ich später.

Erstmal die Spiele, die ich für Vive besitze und aus denen ich meine Erfahrung schöpfe:

Fantastic Contraption: Könnte für manche interessant sein, aber ich mag das Spielprinzip nicht. Puzzle sind nicht mein Ding.
Job Simulator: Macht ein paar Stunden Spaß, aber kein Wiederspielwert.
MIND Path to Thalamus: Wird schnell langweilig. Stundenlanges Rumgerenne ohne etwas tun zu müssen, aber schöne Welten.
Out of Ammo: Wave Shooter mit noch zuwenig Content, Spielspaß hält nicht lange an
Pool Nation VR: Leider eine Enttäuschung für mich. Miese Steuerung.
The Visitor: 5 Minuten Spielzeit
Zombie Training Simulator: Das ist wirklich gut und macht zwischendurch Spaß, aber leider immer das selbe und zuwenig Content. Trotzdem guter Wave-Shooter.
The Blue: Schönes Erlebnis, aber nur 10 Minuten Spielzeit

Vanishing Realms hatte ich zuerst nur relativ kurz angespielt, bin aber recht weit gekommen (hatte bereits den Bogen). Ich fand es nicht schlecht, aber auf Dauer eher lahm, bis ich mich vor wenigen Tagen intensiver mit dem Spiel beschäftigt habe und noch einmal von vorne angefangen habe.
Dabei ist mir aufgefallen, dass Vanishing Realms vor Secrets nur so wimmelt. Ziel sollte es sein, soviel Gold und Secrets zu finden, wie möglich. Nur dann bekommt man die beste Ausrüstung. Beim ersten Durchlauf konnte ich mir nur das schwächste Schwert und den schwächsten Bogen leisten und fragte mich, wie zur Hölle soll ich an soviel Gold kommen?
Jetzt habe ich festgestellt, dass unter dutzenden Steinen, Büchern, Kerzen,... Münzen versteckt sind. Außerdem kann man Vorhänge, Teppiche, Stroh, usw. mit der Fackel verbrennen und auch dahinter verbirgen sich Secrets. Man kann Kisten, Fässer, Vasen, Sargdeckel und alles mögliche zerschlagen. In den Räumen hängen in den Ecken Spinnweben mit Goldkrügen. Wenn man die Spinnweben verbrennt, fallen die Krüge in Reichweite. Es gibt geheime Orte. Dieser hier ist wirklich super: [spoiler]Auf der Insel, wo man eines der 3 Schwerter kaufen kann, ziemlich am Anfang, sollte man sich alle Inseln drumherum anschauen. Man findet u.a. einen roten wertvollen Krug (ingame Achievement) und auf einer entfernten Insel steht ein Grabstein mit einem Rätsel: Man soll ein Leuchtfeucher auf der Klippe entzünden. Es gibt eine Möglichkeit, dort hinzukommen und hinaufzukletter. Dabei findet man noch mehr Schätze auf dem Weg (Boot). Viel Spaß beim Suchen. [/spoiler]

Man kann und sollte also jeden Stein umdrehen und sich alles genau anschauen. Und bei der Länge des Spiels (es gibt viele Kapitel) ergibt sich daraus eine enorme Spielzeit. Außerdem gibt es ingame Achievements, die man unlocken kann, z.B. Entzünde 75 Kerzen, finde 30 rote Krüge, schiesse 20 Äpfel von Bäumen, etc. Auch das motiviert, alles mögliche zu versuchen. 
Ich habe jetzt mit dem Spiel neu angefangen und bereits wieder fast 2h am Stück gespielt und bin noch weit am Anfang (noch nicht mal da, wo ich beim ersten Mal Spielen nach nicht mal einer Stunde aufgehört habe), weil ich 100% erreichen will und ich habe dabei soviel neues entdeckt. Mein Tipp: Probiert alles aus, untersucht jeden Stein. Man kann z.B. mit Steinen oder Schädeln, usw. Goldkrüge von hochgelegenen Vorsprügen werfen, usw.

Nebenbei sind dann noch die Kämpfe mit Schwert/Schild und Bogen, die auch wirklich Spaß machen und auch da gibt es oft Möglichkeiten, Kämpfe zu umgehen oder starke Feine auf andere Art zu beseitigen. Die Physik im Spiel gefällt mir sehr gut, ebenso der Sound und die Sprachausgabe.

Ihr merkt, ich bin echt begeistert von dem Spiel und ich werde es definitiv weiter und durch spielen. Es ist für mich das ersrte ""richtige"" Spiel für die Vive und keine Techdemo ohne Langzeitmotivation. Ich hoffe, dass noch mehr dieser Spiele entwickelt werden.

Top Spiel. Bestes Vive-Spiel bisher. Klare Kaufempfehlung.",76561197978551808,897,65,344,0,195,1570111533,1477738944,1477738944,True,9,0,0.644012928009033203,0,True,False,True

This gives me that old, nostalgic feeling. Like playing the first Spyro game on the PS1 - except a hundred times cooler because it's a first person dungeon crawler in VR.

- The controls are very intuitive and natural feeling. I'll roll up to a table, toss all the candles over my shoulder, swipe up all the pennies hidden underneath, and chuck the apples in to my backpacks - and it all feels super smooth. 
- The inventory system works great. I can switch up my equipment on the fly really easily, even the stuff in the backpacks. It was occasionally hard to get in the right place, and I often found that I couldn't access it at all while crouching, but most of the time I didn't even have to think about it.
- Moving is done through teleportation, which is pretty standard for a lot of games. Works just fine for this :) Though I did find that it made dodging projectiles and traps super easy! 
- Some really cool events/encounters and interweaving level design (made me think of Dark Souls, coming back out in a familiar places etc).
- Difficulty curve was just right
- Pacing felt right on too - the first chapter didn't drag on but also didn't feel like it zoomed by!

Something that I really appreciate is that is the ability to play this game with a left handed loadout!
Sure, it automatically wants you to put your shield in your left hand and sword in the right, but who says you need to do that? Swap em over and beat those skellies senseless - southpaw style!


The only thing that I felt let me down was the second chapter.

Chapter 1 was wonderful, and I really felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished it. When I moved on to Chapter 2 I saw this cool environment and I was super stoked about the idea of exploring this sun-soaked, temple-looking place - anticipating further challenge with new enemies and maybe some gear upgrades! Building on the content I'd already experienced.
But then it ended up basically just being a series of arena ""kill the dudes"" challenges and nothing more. It felt more like the kind of thing you'd access from the main menu as a separate challenge mode mini-game. I certainly couldn't call it a chapter.

This does nothing to diminish the fun I had in C1, but I hope that the next instalments are more like that than C2. 

Had a whale of a time and this is still my favourite VR experience yet!
 I'm looking forward to seeing what further content is like ^^",76561197981910581,348,4,845,0,534,1608842322,1477616353,1477961114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

26063752,english,"[i]Vanishing Realms[/i] is a VR dungeon crawler that sets out to give a glimpse of what is possible in this new genre.

And if you think hand-to-hand combat with undead creatures might be a bit exhausting, you'd be right. This is not a criticism of the game. As a broad first attempt to get swords, shields, bows and magical items into the hands of players who must use them to block, thrust, parry, dodge and aim while maintaining situational awareness, this game succeeds very well.

What VR demonstrates is that this type of action can be tiring and sweaty work. While it isn't [i]Dance Revolution[/i], having a mask strapped to your face while you are flailing around with toy-like 3D weaponry can result in a lots of facial moisture, foggy eyepieces (no ventilation) and tired arms to accompany the silly grin on your face. Fortunately there's an in-game pause button that allows you to take off your headset, wipe your brow and reach for the adventurer's mead (aka Gatorade). [i]Also it's far more deadly to learn a good stance and sweeping motions instead of trying to bat enemies with wrist flicks. You're using a sword, not a fly-swatter![/i]

Given that this is first-gen VR, this game can also be forgiven for it's cartoon-like world. We're likely some ways off from having Skyrim-esque settings in VR, but if you play this and imagine that one day you might be able to fight Draugr underneath some forgotten cairn in the middle of a snowy pine forest, then it's worth noting this game helped get us there.

Story? Meh. You have no real identity in this game and there is no world to discover, just a series of locations and quest objectives. There's a few easy puzzles to figure out. And for the final act you get to do several rounds of timed arena combat (the Rite of Steel).

I recommend this game with reservations. It's clearly one of the front-runners of the current pack of Vive games that attempt to be more than a demo, yet it still feels demo-like: short, no story and focused on introductory mechanics. One chapter is currently available with another promised to complete the game and a possible third as DLC. That might give it enough length to justify the full price if it happens in the near future. The game won't keep this front-runner position for long as other, newer titles inevitably push beyond those boundaries.

25830230,english,"Just got the Vive set up over the weekend, so I'm as new as they come with VR.  Maybe it's because I'm only a few hours into my VR journey and the novelty has not worn off yet, but this game kinda blew my mind. It's a bit simplistic... this is true... but this experience has changed the way I feel about gaming forever.  Like I said... this is one of my very first VR experiences, so perhaps if I wrote this in the future after spending a couple hundred hours in VR experiences, I'd not write so enthusiastically about this... but for now, I love this game.

I'll try to be objective though to hopefully help someone make a decison about whether or not to buy this.   The setting is kinda cartoony and the enemies look a little Zelda-ish, but when engaged in a sword fight with enemies slightly larger then me, the innocence of their looks temporarily fades away and they feel a bit more menacing.  And that cartoony setting has a real sense of scale and of being a real place.   From the slight vertigo I feel looking over an edge to the floor below me, to feeling moon beams soaking into my skin... It all comes together quite nicely. 

The only criticisms I have are that melee combat is a little easy and repetetive.  Block, strike, block strike... it's hard to mess up. Regardless, it's still fun.   And there are other combat options such as a ranged bow which are fun to use.

Another minor gripe is that enemies seems to just stand around and wait for you to approach.  Would be much cooler if they were a bit more aggressive and plentiful.  But then again, for a VR noob like me, maybe it would be a little too fast paced. 

My biggest overall complaint is that I want more. 

But, none of these things stopped me from having one of the best times in recent memory.  I can't wait to see more games of this type!  Bravo! Well done!

So, if you are new to VR like I am and the VR experience is still fresh, I think it's worth the money to try this one. I don't think you'll be disappointed!",76561198086029376,61,1,211,0,182,1536381934,1475448790,1475448790,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

There is no concept of leveling, or skills, you just have gold that you find and you buy weapons with it.  Mana doesn't replenish, but you can increase your stock.  I had a blast with this and the first chapter definitely had a lot more content.  I'd love to see this game go a bit farther to give people some good feel as to what VR RPGs might start off as, but then I'd like somebody to get this guy a team and some cash flow becuase this has the right feel to it.  I felt like a kid with a tonka toy mining stuff and crawling under traps was a lot of fun.

I managed to complete the first level. The combat was interesting enough, and I like the fact that I got to try out some melee fighting, bow shooting, and magic via magic wand. 

I found the pacing to be... odd. For example, the first level often felt slow because of the exploration component. At least walking around was punctuated with combat encounters. The 2nd level had a completely different pacing. Little or no exploration, but it becomes frantic because activities are timed. I have a particular annoyance for timed things, and I eventually lost interest and stopped playing this game when I kept failing the time-based challenge.

and oh man... ever since i learned about VR i was hoping for a good RPG and here it is!
while wandering around in this world exploring, picking up coins, gems, items finding hidden loot, it feels just right!
i actually started looking into crates and i wasnt even surprised to find even more loot and it all feels so natural,
a very easy to use and easy to overlook and organize your inventory.

pros:
- beautifull and fitting environments
- creates a good mood exactly what you would want out of a vr rpg
- somewhat challenging combat
- makes use of many different aspects that makes the vr experience complete
- one of the more immersive games ive played so far on the vive

cons:
- very, very short, about 2 hours game time and i have explored every corner
- there are bugs (to be expected), but not game breaking
- i feel like you need to do too much back tracking if you want to buy a new weapon, for instance if you want the best sword somewhere at the end of the game its easily a good 5min teleport journey wich becomes very stale very fast
- traps are useless in this game
-no story yet?

nevertheless this is a must buy for people that like a good RPG, its so satisfying collecting coins and mining that i wouldnt even mind there would be more grinding opportunities troughout the game, i could play this game for hours and hours... sadly there is only 2 hours and i almost felt sad when it was over, cant wait for the final game!",76561198017826296,208,7,183,0,183,1475784898,1475363426,1475363426,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game play is absolutely phenomenal. I thought that I'd be turned off by the teleportation movement (which caused me to hesitate adding this title to my library) but to my suprize it works just fine with it and doesn't seem to break immersion.

Sword play is perfect - better than any other title to date. The bow isn't great but is not bad either. I wish the dev would work more on this mechanic and allow arrows to be drawn and nocked similar to 'QuiVR'. It's awesome to see arrows blocked by the shield poking through the other side. 

Interactions with objects is completely satisfying - from mining ore to breaking containers and glass to lighting curtains, pillows, banners, leaves and spider webs on fire. 


Graphics are top notch for a VR title and everything is absolutely wonderous. The world feels alive and is very interactive. 

The haptics feel dead on and the controls are smooth. Even the auto-pause feature (which irritated me at the beginning) is a nice addition to keep you within the chaperone area and from breaking your controllers.

Its one of those games where you end up heartbroken when its over, simply because you just don't want it to end. 

If we can get a game with 10+ hours of gameplay in the future, I'd be more than happy to buy a game of this quality at a full VR game price. I have no problem paying for gaming love when devs back their games up as this one clearly is.  New boss battles, new scenery and foes to battle, new weapons? If these components are in a future FULL build of this series and it plays like it does right now, you'll have my purchase without question. Great job on this title thus far.

25629941,english,"I do not recommend this game in a vaccum. Read on before marking as ""not helpful"" - it's not Reddit, this is a thought-out user review, not an epic troll on an internet forum.

TL;DR - The game is actually somewhat polished, which automatically puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the SteamVR lineup. However, a slew of disappointing design flaws and the cheese-ability of the combat system do little to justify the pricetag when the game is as short as it is. If you're not too picky and willing to play along, go for it.

Pros & cons:

Pros
-quality artstyle, decent enough ambiance to create significant immersion
-the linear levels work without feeling railroady
-sound effects and ""game feel"" work in VR, picking up coins and striking enemies doesn't feel like a chore
-VR allows exploration to feel more like exploration, and less like a slog
-A few nice and simple environmental puzzles keep the game from being a complete wagglefest.

Cons
-Combat is incredibly easy to cheese. Waggling your sword at an enemy's head essentially guarantees victory. Add in a few quick teleports from place to place on bosses, and you've got a low-effort strategy that can wreck anything without actually playing along.
-No artificial locomotion options. Unless it was some hidden options menu I missed, there was no way of giving the player any option other than teleportation. While TP is a nice default for comfort's sake, there are people who would like to use it, especially in the early days of roomscale VR software.
-It's short as all hell.
-It's insultingly easy, even if you play along and don't cheese fights. The telegraphs are massive, and the shield blocks EVERYTHING with no penalties.
-Melee enemies pretend you don't exist until you're already in striking distance. I was expecting to be ganged up on numerous times by the enemy configurations, and never was unless I explicitly tried to. Even when I was firing the bow+arrow at their friends, they never did anything but look confusedly in my direction sometimes. 
-Exploration yields little, save for a few coins. 

ALL THIS BEING SAID, Vanishing Realms is still one of the best VR games I've played. For most, the novelty of VR outweighs the subpar nature of the game itself.

I dont like sitting still while playing. So I bought a Vive, and i own 70 titles at this point. Or more. I can´t get enough.

Vanishing realms: This is, without a doubt the best game I have ever played. Yes, there are some things that need to be fixed, and it is still early access. But it is truly astounding he amount of joy I get running through this wonderful Dungeon Crawler! This is the game i dreamt about as a child! Thank you Devs, you are true heroes!


I play on warrior mode, got to sixth rite of passage where I got tangled in my cable and yanked the power cable out of my link box ^^:

Good Stuff:
Swordplay: Amazing! I will not say it cant improve, but holy hell! you guys really put in alot of work compared to any other game I have ever seen. Keep it up!

Ai: Sure, there are still some dumb stuff the monsters do, but the AI in this is sometimes scary good.
Big plus for the trap devs! Got me seriously fooled!

Bow and arrow: Excellent. Just leave it as it is. Maby make it more real and harder still. But if not, its fine as it is!

Gameplay and movement: I enjoy the heck out of it! I don´t mind the teleportation too much, even though it always sucks, your teleportation is the least suckiest at the moment. The game kind of makes up for it in this case :) The story is a little bit thin, but it feels like the devs are working up to something. I can´t wait! I almost got tears in my eyes when i found the new path!

The riddles: They are wonderfully written :)

Bad stuff:
I dropped both my pick-axes accidentally, and both disappeared into the floor or wall or somewhere. Could not find them again. So I had to play a very long way around before I got it all back to where I wanted to be. It´s ok though, it was fun ;) Still, if i drop something, I want to be able to pick it up.

Got some bugs where I suddenly, after teleporting, was standing right in front of a monster that had not been there before. Scared the living smurfs out of me. Only happened once.


Some words to the devs:
Do not make it easier. Do not let people tell you they have to be able to pick through inventory faster or anything like that. Remember, this is VR, make it as you are doing now. So that we have to get physically better irl to get better in the game. Thats the beauty of vr! Don´t you think?

Still an amazing Zelda inspired VR RPG. Still an incredible value.

https://youtu.be/M_-wrSKisxg

Visually the game will likely feel dated to most with the low poly and cartoonish look and feel. I personally think that it fits the game and don't have a problem with it. Consistency is more important to me. As soon as I put the headset on I'm immersed in that world and as long as there's nothing that clashes with the rest of the world or looks out of place I'm fairly lenient. IE a 50k poly photo realistic dragon popping out of no where in a low poly cartoony game.

The gameplay is the tried and true Vanishing Realms formula. Some periods of calm with discovery, riddles and gathering interspersed with intense combat. This formula works for me and there are no complains about getting more of it.

I will say, however, that everyone talking in rhymes and riddles can get a bit old having to parse what's being explained. The story elements probably shouldn't be a puzzle but that's fairly minor. It's kind like if everyone in Borderlands spoke like Zer0. I would go from a likeable trait to overkill in short order but wouldn't really impact the gameplay.

There are definitely some issues with the game. This is a single dev indie title. It would be very strange for there not to be issues. The ever so frustrating torch/general grip mechanics for things not weapons. Both the pick and the planks also suffered from this bug that causes the item to constantly be dropped from your hand. I'm not sure how it was being triggered but it was definitely frustrating. Hopefully this gets patched out soon.

The UI/UX at the start of the game could also use some work. It's just plain confusing how you interact with it. It worked and made sense when there was just one chapter but now that we have 3 it really seems to be lacking. Even with my extra large play space, chapter 3s menu was out of my play bounds and easy to miss. There's a lot of room for refinement here.

In the end it comes down to the question: ""Did I have fun?"" As with the original game the answer is absolutely! Vanishing Realms is still a vary unique VR experience even 3-4 years after its initial launch date. Anyone who enjoys RPGs or dungeon crawls should own a copy of Vanishing Realms along with The Sundered Rift

An amazing hack and slash that feels similar to titles like Zelda: A Link to the Past both visually and in design. When I put on the headset I feel like I was dropped into one of those dungeons and left to wander. It's a great feeling.

This was one of the first VR games I played and it was amazing in its first iteration. There have been two content updates since then and it's gotten significantly better. 

Combat feels better in hard mode, like you're actually sparring with an opponent rather than smacking a training dummy. I'm loving the Warriors Challenge addition.

I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something melee focused. If you're at all interested in a Zelda VR or Skyrim VR game, check this title out. For 19.99, you get 5-6 hours of gameplay that they're actively expanding on. It's one of the few diamonds in the EA lineup that polished and fun.

While it's certainly rough around the edges so far and the second part is little more than an arena, it's great to see how well a sword & sorcery type of adventure works on the Vive.

You move around teleporting and you have your two controllers as hands to which you can equip various things. There's no limb severing or anything like that, but the sword fighting was especially satisfying. The main trick is to block and punish. Blocking can be done both with a shield and a sword. Arrow/ranged combat isn't as refined as in other games like the Lab or Trickster, but it serves its purpose well enough.

25105499,english,"Ah, Vanishing Realms; or as I like to call it: “Drywall Hole Creation Tool.”

The 1st level is about as good as it gets when it comes to making you lose yourself to the world that a game designer has created.  The graphics and artwork are very WoW style colorful, and the game itself is VERY immersive. More than once I would find myself so lost in the environment and graphics I wouldn’t notice the chaperone and would literally punch a wall in an attempt to stab a monster.  That’s Ok.  My girlfriend is good at drywall.  

Thank the gods because I’m a nerd not a contractor.  If I can’t fix it with DAP it isn’t getting fixed.

The 2nd level is a wave fighting arena mode.  It’s not as good.  I found myself slogging through it to just see what happened in the end.  It wasn’t boring.  It just wasn’t what I had hoped after seeing the epic RPG of the 1st level.

The ending…well…that’s something to behold. 

Overall this is well worth the early access fees because I can see it going up in price (And still being worth it if they continue what they have in the 1st level on subsequent levels to come.)

Pros:
•	Colorful graphics
•	Neat art design. It will remind you of WoW but has a style of its own.
•	Immersive gameplay that will have you hunting up solutions to puzzles, and fighting bad guys around every corner.

Cons:
•	Your drywall will suffer if you are in a smaller play area.
•	Your girlfriend will get tired of patching drywall.
•	The AI is pretty dumb.  The bad guys were fun to fight but I never felt really threatened or like I had a chance of getting killed.
•	No locomotion options besides teleport.  I realize this has been a common design choice because of how many people don’t have their VR legs, but those of us who don’t get nauseous really appreciate having the ability to move a bit more naturally in a game like this.

Overall: 8/10. Would get drywall dust on my knuckles again.

Let me start by saying, I do not own this game and have not reached the end. However, I played for approximately an hour and a half (felt like 15 minutes) at a friend's house. I would like to own this game, but having played most of the way through it I can't justify the price today other than for developer support (which is why I'm writing the review, seriously this guy is amazing.)

Pros:
Worth the price!
Active developer, more content imminent
No big brother looking over dev’s shoulders pushing timelines and features that will ruin the experience (ahem, Battlefront I'm looking at you)
Boss mechanics done well
So darn immersive, it's inexplicable
Polished to a sheen

Cons:
Short
Costly for early an access title

Other thoughts:
A texture update couldn't hurt
Difficulty settings would be welcome
For some reason, I didn't want to play out until I read reviews (perhaps a better trailer or world tech demo would help with that)
Choices for movement style, currently only teleporting (works well, but not the best for full immersion I feel like a Virtuix Omni and more content would destroy my life for a while like Final Fantasy 7 or Goldeneye 64 did)

The auto-pause feature is great too and I'm in a room slightly smaller than the minimum and did not have too much trouble. I did not find any bugs! Great job so far. I would like to see more hidden items and I'm always hoping for secret rooms with hidden buttons or triggers. I found the monsters a little too easy to kill especailly if you just hang back and hit them with unending arrows. Maybe there is a difficulty setting that I missed or I sugest adding one. Enemy projectiles could go a little faster. Maybe the sword skeletons could block arrows better. Another idea would be more loot from monsters depending on how you kill them. ie skeletons give no loot with 100% arrow damage.

environments are great, i think this is a great game to demo to VR to people.

The enemies wont move until you get real close, lots of improvements could be made to the AI but it is one of the more graphically impressive vr experiences at the moment. The fighting is a bit simple, its just hold up the shield and poke the enemy in the face at the same point each time they attack.

The inventory system is cool but not really needed as the game is so short you tend to have completed it before you needed to eat any of that food you collected.

Полноценная РПГ, а не аттракцион-обрубок, да еще и с интересными механиками.

В целом, пожалуй, больше всего это похоже на классические РПГ в те времена, когда они только зарождались:
Линейные уровни, простенький сюжет, предсказуемые атаки мобов, секреточки, мана-хп-деньги в простейшем их проявлении, какие-то сторонние необязательные действия(Вроде покопать руду ради лишних монеток), ну и прочее подобное, никаких эксперементальных фишек, новых взглядов на вещи и тому подобного тут нет. Пожалуй, будь бы она на мониторе, с обычным геймпадом в руках — это было бы скучно

Но, знаете, когда ты своими собственными руками отбиваешь стрелы, уходишь в сторону от атак, проползаешь под качающимися ловушками - это совсем другие впечатления. Надеюсь, что эта игра - если не очень большой, то точно твердый шаг на пути к хорошим VR проектам
Увы, тут есть некоторые проблемы, от которых никуда не деться — тут неVRный дизайн уровней, из-за чего впечатления несколько затираются, а битва с боссами проходит по схеме ""телепорт-удар-телепорт""(Ох как я бы хотел попробовать поиграть в комнате хотя бы 5мх5м) а сам VRный интерактив довльно слабоват(От казуальной механики боя, до упрощенных взаимодейсвий с окружением).

Еще хотелось бы отметить два момента:
Во-первых, это приятная темная цветовая схема, от которой не сильно устают глаза, а во-вторых очень простенькая(На приятная графика), благодаря чему требовательность к железу у этого проекта не слишком высокая.

24809348,english,"I thought this was fantastic.  A really good example of what the Vive can deliver.

Like most VR material, the graphics and gameplay are pretty old school.  But what they lack in graphic detail and complexity, they make up for in immersion.

The environments in this game have been generously put together with a lot of interactivity.  Try banging your sword and shield together for example.  A number of the interiors are a pleasure to walk through and explore and had a good balance of things to do and puzzles to solve.

The story line is simple - again, old school, but your first interaction with a skeleton warrior - right there - in front of you - trying to kill you, is something you can only experience in VR, and this game does it well.   The fighting has been beautifully realised.  Particularly the sword and shield combat.  I found myself sweating after a series of hack and slash encounters.

Teleporting has been done well in this game too.  I found it produced no discomfort or nausea.

I struggle to come up with any negatives other than those limits which are imposed on any VR material at the moment - ie lower graphic detail and game length.

Looking forward to the next chapter.

The game just brims with what I will call ""thoughtfullness"". The dev clearly put a lot of thought into the control scheme and it works very well. It's practical, useful and doesn't break the immersion. 

The environments are fantastic. When you're experiencing it in a VR environment it isn't cartoon-y. It's just what your environment looks like and  your brain gets on with the adventuring. 

Combat is a lot of fun if a tad simple. I think the key is to remember to make your own fun. Sweep the sword or hammer reasonably instead of wiggling it around like a wii controller and it's a much more satisfying experience.

Or a way to turn your body without having to physically do it (a button on the controller?) When my head is tethered to cables, I don't really want to be turning around a lot.

Great during chapter one, a really fun and interesting way to use the controllers; holding a shield in one hand and a sword/hammer in the other and fighting skeletons is great, mining feels great, inventory system is sweet and looting is aswell.

The game looks and sounds very good. The graphics aren't ""good"" but the artstyle is!  Most of the environments in chapter one are really cool, like being in a cartoonish dungeon in an Elder Scrolls-game.

My biggest gripe with this game is the thing called ""chapter two"", which is basically just a horde mode. This would be a very nice thing to have as an unlock (maybe? or just an option in the main menu) where you can head in and just do some fighting or to train, but not when it's called a chapter, like a big important part of the games story. Here's hoping it's just an early access place holder!

I found I was able to pass the main first level in about 1.25 hours, and those 1.25 hours were highly enjoyable. I actually did not notice dropping into a combat stance, shield in front, sword at the ready, until I lunged and accidentally hit the chaperone bounds and the game auto-paused asking me to kindly recenter myself in the play area (with a nice big green circle with about 75 arrows pointing to it going ""stand here, dumbass"" :P ). Also, ducking behind boulders, knocking and drawing an arrow, then popping up and firing at those goddamned annoying arrow skeletons....

If you played things like D&D as a kid, or enjoyed games like Shadows of Mordor, Dragon Age, etc, where you did the sword n board n sorcery style of gameplay, this game is WELL worth the asking price. 

The second level, as noted, is more of a padding to the game, just to test you against multiple enemies and see how you do.... but it's still a great game and a lot of fun.

24622822,english,"This is the first room-scale game that I have played on Vive, mostly due to the fact that I have only just managed to clear a space large enough to play room-scale games.

This is an early access title, but other than the fact that it is rather short I can't see anything that needs more doing to it.  I had one crash throughout the entire game, which is better than for a lot of finished games.  

I thought that the point and click movement system would bug me but it didn't and lends itself to the game very well.  The combat felt polished and was enjoyable.  It feels a bit weird to have a huge sword that doesn't weigh anything but you quickly forget thtat once you are hacking, slashing, and parrying with the monsters in the world.  

The monsters are a bit limited, there are only six or seven of them but it really doesn't matter.  The sword and shield fighting is fun and well realised and the bow and arrow action is excellent.  My only problem was not being able to hit a skeleton thing on top of a pedestal because, as it turns out, the light shade was in the way, but that's just a VR thing.  

The only crash I had was that I suddenly dropped through the floor and couldn't find any way back.  It happened once and that was it.  Everything else was completely solid.  

The game is a little more cartoonish than the advertising graphic might indicate but, again, that didn't really detract from it.  

I am really, really hoping that the reason this is early access is so that further chapters can be added to it.

Pros:
- Very immersive
- Fun sword play where you have to wait for your opponent's vulnerable areas to be exposed and aim for them before you can do damage.  
- Brilliant bow and arrow action - you have to hold the bow in one hand and draw it with the other.  The arrows fly in an arc requiring you to take that into account for long shots.
- Very smooth gameplay
- Very few bugs or glitches
- Intuitive movement system
- Very polished product - I didn't even spot any typos in the scrolls

Cons
- A bit on the short side - what you see as my play time above is how long it took me to finish it but it was an enjoyable 2.9 hours.
- Quickly switching between weapons is a bit fiddly ... actually, I'm not even sure if this is a con as it adds to the realism a bit.

A few picky little ways to improve this game would be to have the melee skeleys attack a liiiiiiiittle faster. Admittedly, I two'd in my pants a lil bit at the first skeleton, but when I had the time to actually go drop a two in the bathroom before getting slashed, the intimidation wore off. 
Also, here's some even stingier pickiness - it would be awesome for the weapons that you hold to interact with all the environment and not just phase through it. Having my weapons simply go through walls and the likes makes the game feel less realistic than it could be. A fantastic example of what prime enviornment X held item physics should look like in this game could be seen in Modbox.

24369974,german,"Vanishing Realms ist für einen kleinen Titel gut gemacht, besonderes Lob verdient das Inventar. Auch wenn ich mir wüschen würde, das die Lebenspunktanzeige präsenter sichtbar wäre. so ist das Inventar extrem übersichtlich und Intuitiv. Jeder Gegenstand ist in zwei Taschen als dreidimensionales Item abgebildet und sollte man mehrer der gleichen Sorte besitzen, bekommt der umgebene Ring des Gegenstands einfach eine kleine Kugel. Waffen, Schilde. Bögen und Stäbe haben ihren eigenen Invetarplatz. 

Beim Kampf sollte man sich die Zeit nehmen die Bewegungen des Gegners zu berücksichtigen und nicht in ein ""wildes Gefuchtel"" verfallen. Trifft der Gegner das Schild des alten Egos, prallt die Waffe ab und man bekommt die offene Flanke als  Möglichkeit zur Reposte geboten. Leider funktioniert das Abprallen beim Überkopfschlag des Gegners nicht und die Waffe geht glatt durch Schuld und Körper durch, auch wenn dies nicht als Treffer gezählt wird. Läßt man sich wie beschrieben darauf ein, wird man aber mit einem Kampf belohnt, der mit der gegebenen Technik sich nicht echter anfühlen könnte. 

Schade finde ich, das Bäume nicht als Deckung nutzbar sind, Pfeile gingen bei mir regelmäßig durch die Bäume durch, bei Steinpfeilern klappte dies aber anstandlos. Es macht wirklich Spass sich hinter einem Pfeiler zu verstecken und zum schießen der Pfeile mal kurz um die Ecke zu linsen.

     Indimo Labs has crammed as much MMO / RPG elements into a small compelling package as they can. This feels more like a showpiece of what's possible, more than a full game, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

     While playing this I often ran into situations where I thought ""Wow, it would be cool if this was an MMO"". While mining I thought ""Wow, profession systems translate really well to VR"". While switching from the bow, to the sword and board, to dual wielding swords, to the magic system, I realized there's a very real possibility of a class system here. Each style of combat was fun enough on it's own and could be expanded upon.

     That brings me to my only negative about this game. There isn't enough of this game. GIVE ME MORE. I know the install base for VR isn't large enough yet to invest the resources that it would take to build up a large MMO universe, but Vanishing Realms gives you just a taste of what's possible and I'm hungry for more. It's only a matter of time and I look forward to the next chapters. That being said the game progresses very fast and I was able to complete it in under 2 hours.

The graphics are a bit low poly, but that is made up for with a well conceptualized and executed style. My biggest gripe about the look and feel of the game is the inventory system and player stats. The live at the player waistline and can be hard to make out at the periphery of the Vive's screen when you have to look down. Other ties, they are blocking your view if you need to interact with something at your feet.

I have encounter some bugs that have caused crashes, and in one situation, I got into a part of the environment, that I was not able to teleport out of.

Combat comes in two flavors, melee and projectile. Melee suffers a bit from the fact that VR can't provide physical resistance. Projectile, shooting arrows and using magic wands is the really fun stuff. Dodging behind rocks and other obstacles to avoid being hit yourself can get your heart rate going and really brings you into the world.

If I were to compare it to any other VR experience I have had, the closest thing would be The Gallery, which is significantly better in the graphics and story department, but it is more puzzle oriented, with Vanishing Realms more fun.

Edit:  Not sure why the above information isn't helpful.  I will add:  Blocking enemy swords with your own sword or shield feels pretty damn good, and blocking arrows with your shield is even better.  However, having an enemy block you (and your hand + sword continuing through your swing unimpeded IRL) creates a disconnect between the VR world and the real.  It simply does *not* feel good.  I can really see how some people would like this game, but the fact is, if it wasn't in VR, it wouldn't be that great of a game, and VR doesn't add as much to it as it does to other games.

23760381,english,"Fun game! - the motion controllers are what totally make the experience work: using them as sword/shield/bow makes the combat so much more compelling.  I'm only up to chapter 5 (I think).

A few nits/suggestions to the developers, mostly about inventory management:

* the HUD interface for gear selection needs work - the way it's locked to your eyes based on which way you were looking when you looked down frequently requires me to look back up, then look straight, then look down - very awkward
* having the HUD on look-down messes with the immersion in the game - why not have it pop up on a menu button push?  you spend a lot of time looking down hunting for ruby goblets, etc - the HUD gets in the way
* not having the game pause for inventory management only makes tense combat moments more stressful (not in a good way) - it doesn't feel realistic to be facing off against a surprise enemy and have to.... stare at your feet while caaaaarefully pointing and clicking
* since the game is very linear, i spend a lot of time fretting that i'm missing some secrets, because (it seems) it would be rather onerous to go back - it would be nice to have a generic ""secrets found"" counter or some such to relieve that.  alternatively, you could make the environment more conducive to backtracking (shortcuts back to earlier parts that open once you've successfully completed an area, etc.)
* the torch is a useful enough standard item, i'd like it to have its own separate inventory slot, the way weapons do - maybe with a quick button to toggle it to hand/put it away
* loot collection feels like busywork - maybe just have a trigger pull within such-and-such radius of loot suck it all in - having to touch each piece (particularly when they get obscured by unmovable objects or embedded in fragments) is annoying (it's not like the loot's realistically fallen to the ground - why make me touch each piece?)

Pro:
- The one-to-one tracking of hands is great. You get so much freedom with your fighting style and when you block stuff YOUR ACTUALLY BLOCKING IT.
- Love the realism with putting keys in locks to open locked doors and lighting candles with your torch

Con:
- The bow is not that great. The draw length of the bow is too short for me. I end up pulling my hand to 10 cm in front of my body instead of slightly behind. This should be adjustable. Also the anchor point on the controller is a bit to close to the hand so you don't get to draw the bow back correctly.
- Magic is a bit boring. Its just a projectile weapon using Mana as ammo.
- THIS is what changed my review to negative: With about a 2 hour playthough with good but limited gameplay options this game is good - for an early access. But the developer has said that he is about to make the game official and charge for future content. This game is not wide or deep enough to justify $20 price tag. I bought this game expecting much more bang to come from my buck.

Half way though the game I adopted a 2 handed fighting style and loved every second of mahem I rought on my enemies.

Spend a whole day completing this game, enjoying the scenery and marvelling at how awesome it all is. Really looking forward to more content in the future.

I think this game is a fantastic benchmark for future RPG and MMORPG games to follow. I'm thinking... this is what Elder Scrolls 6 should be. Wow that would be so unbelievably epic!

Having said all that, until the developer backtracks on his plans for future content or reduces the price, I can't recommend that people buy this. When I first recommended this game, there were no games like this on VR. Now there are more and more and so I'm less inclined to have VR gamers pay exorbitant prices.

23693263,english,"Great game for the Vive. I would recommend it to anyone first picking up the system and those that love fantasy combat.
 Below is a list of Pros and Cons for me personally. Maybe it'll be helpful to you. Overall, I loved the experience, and just nitpick a bit here.


Pros:
-Combat feels awesome, especially when you have multiple enemies engaging you at once
- World looks good, and the atmoshere is nice
-Teleporting mechanic doesn't take you out of the immersion (unless you blink around like a dingus)
- Stats and user interface are easy to understand
- Puzzles and clues are neither too challenging, nor too simple
- Hidden items/easter eggs are fun to look for here
- Distinctly different weapons for various situations
-Some enemy variety

Cons:
- Switching to the bow can be difficult at times
- The wand weapon that you get is simply too powerful. It makes clearing the final boss incredibly easy if you have maxed out your mana.
- Enemies do not pursue the player aggressively enough
- Combat doesn't scale up fast enough (by about 30 minutes in you should be able to kill everything with little issue, unless you are swarmed). Enemies need to attack faster.
- Enemies are fairly similar in regards to combat behavior. Would like to see more behaviors, or something simple like some skeleton warriors having their sword+shield hands switched.
- The final boss lost some of his wow and scare factor after figuring our this pattern. Needs some more attack patterns to make him more challenging.
- The sequence of trials after the main quest is kind of fun... but overall not challenging enough at that point or as engaging as the rest of the game.
- It takes a good amount of time for you to face your first enemy... like longer than you need it to be. It makes it sometimes hard to show it to friends, as they can't drop right into the action.

Everything feels intuitive, you pick up an object and put it in your belt. You look at your belt and pick up what's there. You parry a blow and reposte while the enemy is staggered or go for a quick thrust after a block with your shield, it all makes sense and works.

As far as improvements, I would like to see a little more depth to the combat (the animations are brilliant and really highlight how the enemy will attack however after you've gone through a few it is quite easy. Also if you get in close to the bosses they struggle to hit you with some attacks (even without needing to block or parry).

23664858,english,"A great game that shows where VR could be going. I would recommend it to anyone interested in complex (if ""gamey"" rather than simulationist) combat, dungeon delving, and some light puzzle solving.

I completed the game in just over an hour and a half, which makes it on the shorter side for a game of this price. However, that would be comparing it to games played on a screen, vs. the experience you get here in VR. And boy does it pay off. Performing each swing and block, aiming every shot, and grabbing every lever is quite different from just pressing buttons to ""use"", ""attack"", ""block"", etc. The exchange of blows and blocks felt good, if a little easy (feeling generously telegraphed) by the end. I felt the pressure of being flanked in combat, and the instant fear of arrows coming from an unknown source (which you are able to quickly track down by sound, naturally). Still, I'm itching to see more.

I do like a lot of the mechanics introduced for the VR medium. If you stick your head into something, your vision blurs, or you're pushed back into an open space. Nice. The teleportation movement system works well enough, though I must say I quite enjoyed the more natural movement used in Spell Fighter once I got over the initial disorientation.

The only major complaint I would have is that the game seems to be designed for someone much shorter (I'm 6'4""/193cm and tend to tower over other Hover Junkers players). There are many low ceilings (namely in the arena) and the space feels constrained, even though I have a generous space and stayed away from the Chaperone walls. The game automatically pauses if you try to push too far outside of reach, which became an annoyance at certain points in grabbing objects or attacking some enemies, given my long reach. Default combat distance seems to be incredibly close, and enemies tend to engage me right in my face, far within the reach of my sword, not the kind of distance I like to be at while fencing! Engaging the archers in melee was also annoying as they appeared to only come up to my knees and I had to golf swing to take them out; helmets blocked any reasonable swing I would normally take.

Vanishing Realms ist leider das erste Spiel wobei mir ein wenig schlecht wurde :( Aber das trübt den Spielspass nicht im geringstens :)

Steuerung:
Typisch für VR (HTC VIVE) man befindet sich in seinem virtuellen Raum und Teleportiert sich durch die Welt. 
Die Gitterlinien sollte man aber aktiviert lassen, dass man nicht dauernd gegen die Wand /Tisch /Schrank/TV oder so schlägt/läuft :)
Ausweichen der Gegnerrischen Pfeile / Feuergeschosse passiert ganz intuitiv :)
Die Waffen fühlen sich sehr gut an, wobei das Trefferfeedback noch überabreitet werrden müsste. 
Das Blocken funktioniert auch tadelos mit Schwert/Hammer /Schild.

Zum Spiel:
Man löst kleine Rätseleinlagen, wie Schlüssel suchen, Schalter betätigen und Bosse eliminieren.

Als ich das erste mal vor einen Gegner stand, hatte ich mich gar nicht heran getraut, gut das die Gegner erst ab einer bestimmten Entfernung einen angreifen. Habe mich auch immer wieder dabei erwischt wie ich aus der sicheren Entfernung die Gegner beschossen hatte (Zauber/Pfeile) dooferweiße weichen die Gegner irgendwann den Pfeilen aus und Mana hat man auch nicht unbegrenzt :) Also ist man irgendwann darauf angewiesen in den Nahkampf zu gehen. Und das ist absolut beeintruckend!

Fazit: Das Mittendringefühl ist der Hammer, Die Kämpfe machen Spaß und das Erkunden (Looten, etc) macht sehr viel Spaß. Einziges Manko für mich war das nicht 100 prozentige Trefferfeedback bei den Gegnern (aber vertretbar:) ) und das ich bei diesen Titel leichtes motion sickness bei mir herausbeschwört, bisher aber zum Glück der einzige Titel :)

Also Absolute Kaufempfehlung! :)

23616803,english,"I thought I would really like this game, but for a couple reasons it was very disappointing to me.  

The first reason is the lack of non teleport movement.  I understand that teleporting is supposed to reduce motion sickness and discomfort at the cost of immersion, but in this game I don't think teleportation is helping.  While traversing and fighting monsters in this game you will want to  take many small teleports rapidly in sucession.  This ends up resembling a slideshow.  I find this to be very disorienting and motion sickness inducing.  A more traditional smooth movement would be much much preferable to me.

My second problem is that I was not a fan of the design and art in the game.  I expected it to feel more atmospheric and epic in scale.  Instead it felt like a retro adventure game that I somehow became trapped in.  Typical lever pulling puzzles, linear map design, and very uninspired environments.

What I'd like to see (besides more episodes, of course :p) is :
    more animations for the skeletons, 
    more skeletons types (There is only three types of standard, and two huge types if I remember well).

-Looking down at the belt to see health can be a bit troublesome since the weight of the headset moves and blurs the image. I believe there is supposed to be no health bar visible so as not to interfere with the environment. It was not a very big issue though.

-I was unsure if stopping and starting would save all progress after a save point so I would jus stay in game when I had to leave. Perhaps a save option in the pause screen.

This is easily one of the best Vive titles I've played. It makes me feel like I'm back in my past playing Zelda on the Super NES for the first time.

The UI is fantastic, so easy to figure out. I quickly picked up the knack for picking up items and storing them on myself.

The level design is wonderful, simple enough, but not that it isn't interesting. I've really enjoyed walking around and exploring all the sights, and you have to, there are many stashed treasures to find.

Combat is simple enough, but perfect for room scale. It's not daunting to face your opponent after the initial contact, I get the feeling of playing older games, where you have to work out the attack patern and counter it to win.

Vanishing Realms leads you in slowly, educating you on how everything works and what you need to do to continue and succeed.

I could gush about this game all day.

If you own a Vive, treat yourself and buy this awesome game. If you haven't bought a vive and are going to, make this game one of your first buys.

23462608,english,"This is a pretty great game.

It's definitely short. It's all over in about two hours, and that includes several tries at the ""second chapter,"" which is really just kind of an arena challenge. In a traditional game, I'd consider this more like a ""vertical slice"" than a finished game, because it introduces a bunch of zelda-like tools (sword, shield, bow, pickaxe, hammer, etc.) but you don't get much use out of any of them. There are only seven kinds of enemies, one of them a boss and the other a miniboss. So it's short.

But for VR right now, this isn't a huge downside; there hasn't really been time to create long games, and the tech is so new that experiences like this feel a bit like a theme park ride. And if this [i]were[/i] a theme park ride, I'd be pretty tempted to pay another $20 to go and do it again. The graphical style and animations are quite polished, and the atmosphere is very well done. And it's hard to overstate how intimidating the giant skeletons in the game are when you first encounter them. By the end of the game, you'll have found exploits for their combat AI, which is pretty limited, but that's fine, because that's how RPGs always are--by the end, you're a seasoned warrior who has no trouble dispatching hordes of low-level enemies and even a boss or two. It's just that here, you're actually more skilled at defeating the enemies.

It's worth noting that my play area is slightly below the minimum requirements: mine is 1.8x2.5m. I was still able to play the game fine, although I did encounter the auto-pause feature a lot. The game pauses if you get too close to the edge of your play area while doing something active, so that you won't swing through your chaperone and break something. At that point it asks you to move back to the center of your play space (which is shown with a green circle and some arrows) and hit a button to unpause. This works pretty well, though it does break up the flow of the action a little. I still hit things through my chaperone a [i]little,[/i] but mostly when doing gentle things like reaching for a potion, so I didn't do any serious damage. A nice large space will give you the best experience with the game, but you can get away with just under the minimum.

Thoroughly enjoyable - the only downside is it ends too soon!  1-2 hours is a likely first playthrough, and in truth theres not much to go back through for (apart from sheer enjoyment ofc) but damn i would happily have played on for another 10-20 hours!  :)  Testament to the game I guess.

GTX 1080 on the way) but I have been slowly trying games out and since I've been having more success then failures I decided to give this a try, mainly due to the reviews being so glowing as I normally AVOID Early Access like the plague since I've been burned too many times.

I am beyond glad I did ... just the first 10 minutes of the game were utterly mind blowing.  The immersion of simply grabbing a torch off the wall and having the lighting change as you hold it over your head is just magical.  Having a 'duck and cover' bow fight with a skeleton is just silly ... LOL.  If you have a Vive this is an instant must buy

23384508,japanese,"ゲーマーなら誰だって夢見たことがあるだろう、剣と魔法のRPGの世界に入り込んで主人公になる事を。
このゲームはその夢をViveを使って実現する一本である。

プレイヤーは剣、盾、弓矢、魔法の杖を駆使し、古代遺跡の謎を解き明かすのが目的。
2本のViveコントローラを利用し、盾で敵の攻撃を弾いたり、剣で攻撃を叩き落としたあと、剣で突きを入れる等、かなりリアルに近いチャンバラができる。
しかもこのゲームは立位や座位ではなく、ルームスケール専用である。
ルームスケールの範囲内であれば、敵の攻撃を本当に避け、回り込み、斬るという動作ができてしまう。
おかげで没入感は尋常ではなく、解像度以外はほぼ現実と言っても過言ではない。
最初に敵に襲われた時は、本当に死ぬかと思ったくらい迫力があった。

遠くに居る敵には弓矢、まとまった敵を一掃する際には魔法の杖が使える。
弓矢はちゃんと両手で弓を引く動作を取らなければならない。
敵にも遠距離攻撃を仕掛けてくる奴が居るので、物陰に隠れつつ、敵の攻撃が止んだら体を出して弓を撃つなんてこともできる。

そこそこの運動量があるので、リアルのプレイヤーが疲れてしまうこともある。
その際はそこら辺に寝転んで休憩しよう。綺麗な夜空が見える。
Viveを持っているなら絶対に購入すべき1本。

気になる部分としては、早期アクセスでまだチャプター2までしか実装されていないこと。
敵の種類が少ない事。2時間程度で終わり、特にチャプター2の手抜き感があること。
ルームスケールでそこそこの広さを確保しないと、リアルの壁を殴る可能性があること。
（参考までに、自分は倉庫に使ってた6畳の部屋を丸ごとVR部屋に変えてしまったが、それでも何回かPC置いてる机殴ってた）

While the artistic style is simple it works, the skeleton warriors loom over  you, there is a great visceral feel from banging your sword off your shield before engaging in combat.

If so then give Vanishing Realms a try.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]The atmosphere and polish is off the charts. You really feel like you're there.
[*]Graphics and lighting effects look great.
[*]GUI and inventory managment is relatively fluid.
[*]Different weapons and equipment keeps the game interesting as you progress.
[*]Auto pause when you are about to hit bounds is a life-saver. (You can also turn it off if it annoys you.)
[*]Probably the most immersed I've been in VR so far. A must-have in my opinion.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]If you're not in atleast a 3m by 3m area you're going to be triggering bounds a lot. You can definetly play in a smaller area, but you're going to be teleporting a lot. Which might kill immersion for some people. Game is best enjoyed in a huge area (5m x 5m), where you can really immerse yourself. Walking around and fighting enemies like you mean it.
[*]2 hours just doesn't feel like enough once you finish it. That being said it is on par or better than most VR titles in the cost/playtime department.

[*]Enemy AI is pretty dumb. Even in boss fights, you can just teleport right next to a boss and bash their face in. They won't be able to hit you. Unless you're in melee 3v1 you won't really be challenged.
[*]Not much story to speak of. Usually lore is dropped through in-game scrolls and books, but there isn't much of an attempt at a coherent storyline. Especially in the second half of the episode, where you pop from place to place, even doing a gladitorial arena, with little to no explanation.
[*]Additional graphics options, and optional higher res textures would be welcome.

23302584,english,"The best thing by [i]far[/i] on SteamVR right now. Ignore the ""early access"" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.

What makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: Wield your controller as a sword! Parry attacks! Lunge! Chop! Once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! Use a bow and arrow (like in The Lab)! Switch between them! Yay!

Some ""early access"" things do come up. They are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: Combat is too easy once you understand it. The enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don't know how to move around intelligently. I think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other VR games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. Finally, 2 hours is not enough! By the time I got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! It would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.

But these seem like nitpicks. All in all Vanishing Realms is a wonderful place from which to see the promising VR RPG future.

If only for labeling this ""early access"" Indimo Labs deserves a lot of credit. 90% of the ""full"" releases on SteamVR right now are buggy, incomplete, half-baked experiments.

23284798,english,"This will be my first review on Steam. Hell, it'll be my first review anywhere. 

There's not much I can say that hasn't been, but I'll try anyway since I think devs need to see that their efforts are worthwhile and makeing a huge difference.

I remember playing Legend of Zelda on NES as a kid.  I loved it so much I asked to go to the hardware store, bought a plank of wood, and went at trying to create my own shield. Epic fail, since my artistic and handicraft skills are subpar - at best. But it was the first spark of a decades long, insatiable quest to transport myself to another world and do the things that weren't possible. 

It's been a long time since then, but for the first time ever, I feel like I've come close. This game is the promising first step in that journey. For those of us who have gotten Vive or are contemplating getting it, it's going to be a rough ride until something with Skyrim/Zelda production value comes out. But if you've even the slightest inclination to really feel like you're the hero in the game, this is the closest you can get at this time.

PRO's: 
- Everything you could extrapolate from my introductory statements. You *are* the hero in this game. It's f-in' great. 
- Excellent swordplay mechanics (some prefer Spell Fighter VR - which is great - but I think the dodge/block/parry mechanics are better here). 
- Engaging atmosphere despite the sourced assets (ie: the character models were bought from a store).
- Solid music. 
- Intuitive puzzles.
- Leaves you aching for more content. 

CONS:
- An argument can be made that it is a short experience. However, none of us early adopters should go into *any* game thinking we're going to experience the next Skyrim/Dishonored/etc...
- While I think the utility belt inventory system is very interesting, I have to hyperextend my head downwards to see it. It also moves around erratically when I'm kneeling down. 
- I'd love it if there was more depth to the magic system (currently it's item-based magic limited to one item at this time). Not hoping for a miracle here, but it would've been nice to play as a wizard rather than a sword fighter every time. 
- No Hard Mode. While enemy difficulty does increase slightly, they are far outpaced in damage after gaining the last sword. They also become easier in general by the time you have a second playthrough. Hard Mode needs to happen. 
- Trackpad locomotion for both movement and turning would be superior for those of us with 'vr legs'. I like teleporting sometimes, but in battle I'd rather just reorient myself with the trackpad. It feels like cheating to just teleport away.

Anyway, I hope this inspires other devs to keep the ball rolling and iterate on RPG/Adventure games. And to the dev of this game in particular, please keep up the good work. There's not many who've gambled on anything resembling an RPG at this stage in the VR launch cycle, and you're currently leading the pack by a wide margin. Keep it up.",76561198018567984,233,9,1885,0,892,1569297805,1464579724,1464579724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

23281411,english,"Pros:
+ Nice art style, cartoony but fun.
+ Lots of treasure to find in nooks and crannies, makes exploration fun.
+ Pretty good melee combat mechanics: swing your weapon past an enemies shild and helmet, block their attacks, sometimes they feint, so you have to pay attention and be ready to block from a different angle.

Cons:
- Short, there is only about 2 hours of content here, and little replay value.  The last part of the game (spoiler alert) is just repeated arena fights, perhaps added to pad out the length of the game so people will be less likely to get refunds.
- Dull movement, besides room scale you can only teleport, and because it does not show you where your playspace will be in your prospective destination (like The Lab does), it makes movement frustrating.
- Poor AI, understandable for an early VR game, but the enemies keep backing away, which means I have to keep teleporting close to them because my play space is only 2.5x2.5 meters, but the game sometimes prevents you from teleporting directly next to an enemy.  All in all it feels like enemy movement is working against the melee mechanics.
- Bow is not fun.  It aims wherever your primary hand is pointing it, secondary hand is just used to pull back the arrow, making it feel unrealistic.
- Lack of story, there are just a few cryptic messages guiding you around.  The game has little atmosphere and almost no personality.
- Bad UI, you have to look down to check yout health, mana, gold, and inventory.  This combined with the small sweet spot on the Vive's lenses, makes it difficult to focus on the text.  Maybe it is better for people without glasses, I don't know.
- Abandonware?  The game has passed the time frame layed out in the early access description, with no updates in two months.  The game was described as having almost two hours of content per chapter, but I was able to easily clear both chapters in under two hours, as the second chapter is just a series of arena fights.

I really wanted to like this game based on it's reviews, but I found the gameplay to not be very fun, and it was only challenging when it was frustrating, such as fights against groups of enemies when you can't tell who is hitting you from where.  I was surprised at how soulless the game felt, I never felt there was a good reason for anything I was doing, just dungeon crawling for the sake of it, which once you get past the glitter of ""it's in VR!"" becomes boring fast.

There are some really nice level design moments, such as the room with the archer you can't reach right away, which feel really new in VR. Some suggestions:

- Magnet on object pickup, especially on gold/coins
- Limited, but recoverable, ammo for the bow. It's too exploitable right now.
- All small objects should be interactable. Because so many of them are not, I got confused in the begining and didn't realize I could pick up the torches. Consistency of object interaction seems more important in VR than in regular games.
- A bit more hand holding in the first rooms.  
- Current mechanics for grab/let go are a little confusing as they are slightly different than many games (most likely because you want the sword/etc to equipt without having to keep the trigger pressed) - but I often ended up dropping items by mistake, and eventually lost my pick axe this way.
- More hidden goals, secrets, etc for replayability.

23219026,english,"This is a good game, but not really worth the $20 price tag for how short it is, and more so for how there is practically no replay value as it is right now. Maybe I am spoiled by games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, where after 120 hours of gameplay, I am not even close to done playing? And I picked that up for $30. Here, I am paying $20 for two hours of entertainment, so it doesn't quite add up no matter how good it is.

With that aside, what you do get to experience in those 2 hours is quite good. It is definitely cool to fight the skeletons, especially when dual wielding two swords, even though the fights are a little slow and clunky with so-so collision detection. I can see this maybe becoming a little more worth the price if a few bonus or side quests are added, along with a separately selected arena with leader boards. In a game that already has a bow and arrow, swords, a shield, and a magic wand, the possibilities for mini-games are endless.

Add that extra content, and I would fully recommend this game as a worthwhile $20 investment, but as it is now, I feel a bit slighted, and would not have paid more than $8-$10. It is also interesting to note that since the game takes just over 2 hours to complete, it takes you just past the 2 hour game time limit for returns, and then ends - that seems like a little more than a coincidence to me, but it is mentioned in the description, so it's not like it's a shock when it ends and you are left upset that there isn't more. But that right there is the important part - I was left wanting more. 

I didn't give this game a thumbs down because it is a bad game, I gave it a thumbs down because it is currently rather over-priced. I hope that will change as development continues, and if it does, I will try to remember to update my review/recommendation.

23213374,english,"Vanishing Realms is very engrossing and immersive, and while the gameplay isn't really balanced at all and there's a ton of missing features, I'll give it a weak recommendation because it's still one of the strongest VR titles available right now.

Good first:
*Environments are large, well-crafted, and immersive
*Sound design is good, although 3D positional audio is weak
*Gameplay has some good core mechanics 
*By far the best handling of ""out of bounds""; every other VR game lets you walk through walls and stick your head in solid objects, but Vanishing Realms fades out your view if you stick your head in an object and teleports you backward if you try to walk in a wall. Every game should work like this.

The bad:
(I like to complain so this is much larger than the ""Good"" section, but shouldn't be considered to outweigh the good)
*Gameplay isn't balanced. There isn't enough variety between the weapons - the two bows both do 5 damage, the medium sword and the hammer both do 6 damage, the hammer doesn't work any differently than the sword. Enemies have an aggro range of about 3 feet and you can skip entire battles by standing out of aggro range and blasting away with your ranged weapons. When you're actually in melee range, the enemies crowd you too much; one of those skeleton soldiers fills up your entire screen and makes you constantly want to back up.
*Combat is too simple when you're fighting only one enemy but completely overwhelming and unmanageable when you're fighting 3 enemies, partially because the enemies are so bulky you can only watch one at a time
*Not enough enemy attack animations. The skeleton soldier is the main enemy you encounter and only has two or three animations. After you get used to the timing of its main attack, you get a brief period of feeling badass and then combat starts to go stale.
*There are no consequences for death. You respawn 10 feet away with your inventory intact and the enemies still wounded. This is probably because the gameplay isn't balanced.
*Store assets - the same skeleton soldier also appears in Legend of Luca, which must mean it was bought from the Unity asset store or a third-party asset store. Not inherently bad, but gamers can grow sick of models if they start popping up in multiple games
*Inventory system is buggy, clunky, and impossible to use in combat. Once a fight starts, the only way you can switch weapons is to teleport far away from the fight, which feels like cheating
*Only 2 - 3 hours of gameplay depending on how much you rush and how much you get lost
*Save system is minimalistic - it saves your inventory and your position but not your progress. Enemies and obstacles respawn if you quit the game and load up your save again
*No way to return to the menu without quitting the game. C'mon, this isn't the NES era...
*The developer isn't active on the forum, which is bad form for an EA game. If you don't have a dialog with your customers, you're defeating the entire point of EA",76561197966877172,266,106,347,0,223,1473226559,1464243747,1469773077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

23202030,german,"Vanishing Realms ist das erste ""richtige"" Spiel das ich auf der HTC Vive gespielt habe und man nicht als Demo bezeichnen kann. Und ich muss sagen, es hat mich wirklich sehr unterhalten! 

Gameplay:
Vanishing Realms funktionert einwandfrei in VR. Die Bewegungen werden fast immer perfekt ins Spiel übertragen und es ist einfach beeindruckend, wie man mit Schild und Schwert gegen virtuelle gegner antreten kann. Hierbei ist allerdings zu beachten, dass man ausreichend Platz im Zimmer hat. Meine Spielfläche ist ca. 2 x 1,5 meter groß und es kam mehr als einmal vor, dass ich den Controller gegen die Wand geschmettert habe. Neben Schwert und Schild gibt es unter anderem noch zwei Bogen, die für abwechslung sorgen.
Sehr positiv zu bewerten sind auch Dinge wie das abbauen von Erzen wie Gold und Diamand, sowie die Suche nach anderen ""Schätzen"". Es gibt auch ein kleines Gesundheitssystem, wobei man Tränke, Äpfel oder Orangen essen kann um sich zu erholen.

Story:
Hier gibt es eher wenig zu berichten. Eine wirkliche Geschichte wird einem nicht erzählt. Es gibt lediglich ein paar ""Schriftrollen"" zu studieren die zumeist Hinweise zum lösen eines Rätsels sind. 
Das Spiel baut eher auf dem Erkunderdrang und der VR Erfahrung, als auf einer Geschichte auf.

Grafik:
Die Grafik von Vanishing Realms ist natürlich weit entfernt von neuesten nicht VR Titeln, jedoch mit der Vive definitiv schön anzusehen. Es ist nicht nur einmal passiert, dass ich mir eine kurze auszeit vom Spielen nahm, um mir die Umgebung genauer anzusehen und der typische ""VR wow Effekt"" war selbst in einem Grafisch eher schlichten Titel wie diesem da. Alles ist sehr übersichtlich gestaltet, was der geringen Auflösung des VR headsets zu gute kommt. 
Als ich das erste mal vor einem der Skelett Gegner stand, hatte ich doch schon ziemlich schiss. Ich weiss das sich das lustig anhört, aber wer selbst mal die Erfahrung macht wird sehen was ich meine ;)

Fazit:
Vanishing Realms hat mich ohne Zweifel sehr gut Unterhalten und gezeigt, was zukünftige VR Spiele alles nutzen, bzw. besser machen können. Das einzige was mich zum Schluss dann doch gestört hat, war die Länge des Spiels. Ich hatte das Spiel in etwas mehr als 2 Stunden durchgespielt. Für 20€ hätte ich da schon etwas mehr erwartet. Allerdings kann ich das Spiel trotzdem weiterempfehlen, da es eben eines der bislang besten und einzigen Spielen für die HTC Vive ist.

23174246,english,"I love this game. This is exactly the type of thing I was hoping for when it was announced a few years ago that VR was coming to the mass market. It isn't perfect, but it does a number of things very well.

First, the cons. 

What I didn't see in the description of the game is that it ""highly recommends"" a 2.0 x 2.0 meter space. I live in a small apartment, and my play space is only 2.0x1.6 meter. I can still play the game, but I have to be very careful because any time I stick my sword arm through the ""wall"" (my restricted space is couches, so I can reach well above them, I just can't walk into them) the game pauses, forces me to re-center in the space, and then unpause. Slightly annoying, but better than constantly walking into things. 

However, within about 30 minutes I learned how to not over-extend, but as a 6'0"" guy who has done steel sabre fencing and sword & board fighting in the SCA, it was hard to not try to execute lunges and molinets (wrist turns to get around an opponent's shield and hit them in the face) in that ""forbidden zone"". Treating it more like a video game and less like a fighting simulation did the trick.

The story is a little on the flimsy side. Don't expect anything too deep, you pretty much can get the gist of it from watching the intro video on the Steam page. It's not horrible or bad, it's just basic fantasy tropes.

The pros: 

The graphics are beautiful. To me, titles like this prove that we don't need photo-realism to be immersive in VR, especially when the game runs smoothly. 

Fighting monsters that are taller than I am is a lot of fun. I've always been a fan of games where projectiles persist in the environment, and fighting with an arrow sticking out of your shoulder is surprisingly satisfying. I mentioned the sword and shield mechanic struggles I had above, but it's still a lot of fun to use that weapon combo. The bow and arrow mechanics work fantastically and are a lot of fun, and you can't beat the destructive power of the magic wand.

Objects are easy to interact with and add a lot to the feel. The inventory system is pretty top-notch and intuitive: in need of a little health? Grab that apple out of the pocket you stuck it in and ""eat"" it by holding it up to your mouth. Did you find a key? Go find the lock that it goes to. 

Most of the text is super easy to read. Sometimes I struggle to see the health/mana meters because you have to look at your feet to see them, but the fact that they're out of the way when you're fighting is nice, and you can usually tell by the amount of blood you're looking through how your health is doing. :)

Overall, highly recommended. Don't let the minor flaws get in the way of a good time. If you're the type of person that enjoys adventure RPGs like Legend of Zelda or Fable, you'll probably love Vanishing Realms.",76561198009775253,245,33,168,0,168,1464479770,1464050681,1464050681,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

23163357,english,"I have both the Vive and the Rift and have played a multitude of VR games on both. After I played the two available chapters in Vanishing Realms, it became my favorite VR experience so far. The scale of the first chapter is great and going around the cave and then the open world was great. 

What I really liked about Vanishing Realms was the combat and the way in which the inventory/UI is handled. The combat is crazy satisfying as you go against enemies looking for their attacks to block/parry but then you're also looking for their opennings that you can then strike. Every fight and every kill I got felt satisfying and deserved. 

As for the UI and inventory system, it is really simple and gets the job done. The UI is mostly minamalistic in that when you are looking out normally, you see no UI blocking your view. Everything UI is down below at your waist. When of your stats change (health, mana, or gold) they do pop up into your view but slowly lower back down to your waist. This system is perfect. Then for the gear and weapons you have, there's two 'backpacks', on on the left and right. This allows you to put things like keys, torches, food, potions, etc... in the backpack of the hand you will likely use. Torches and keys I would use in the left, but food and potions which I would need fast in combat were placed in my right pack so that my dominant hand could easily and quickly get to them. Between to two packs are your weapons devided into categories of one-handed melee, ranged-bow, and ranged-wand, and also the shield spot. Getting into fights and having to alternate between the weapons and gear was really simple and I never struggled to fight the way I wanted to in any engagement.

The first hour of the game is very memorable. Standing face to face with a skeleton is shocking. Wandering around dark dungeons gives a distinct feeling, like you stepped inside a Zelda game. It's worth trying out because it's unique, literally can't get this anywhere else. However, there are many design decisions I don't like. The inventory system is barbaric, getting a particular item is always frustrating. The UI bounces up / down to always stay visible even if you don't want to look at it. Grabbing loot is followed by an annoying chime and stupid UI circles right in your face. The game tries really hard to remind you it's just a game, rather then just letting you be in the world. The final combat sequence is a series of enemies that must be defeated inside a short time limit. This is a bad decision, it encourages you to break the already flaky combat system, Actually  blocking swords and striking when you have an oportunity will cause you to fail since it's so time consuming.

This game is a wonderfull experience. It truly embodies the incredible potential of vive VR. ACTUALLY hiding behind a tree to shoot an enemy with your bow is beyond cool, and so is wielding your sword at it.

Please keep in mind that the vive's total resolution is less than that of a WQHD screen which is becoming the standard for gaming. There is no reason for a 2016 game to be so ugly.

Also if you were to play it on a flat screen, you wouldn't even look twice at the game. It's a very ordinary dungeon crawler with nothing much to it (disclaimer : i'm not done with the game yet, i may still have a pleasant surprise).

Combine all this with the price tag for 2h worth of gaming, and you get a clear 'No' from me.

23125260,english,"I have just started playing through Vanishing Realms for the second time, this time I am recording my adventure and thoughts as I go along https://youtu.be/hL1XfwmHstE

It is kind of true that the game is short, and I am still sort of confused as to how future content is going to be pushed through (ie as free updates or as new paid for episodes). However, since VR is new and has limited users its completely understandable why games such as this, which have a cost associated with them only last two to three hours. The developers have to price their games in a way that will bring them a return when sales will be lower than the general PC market. Got it.

That said, the couple of hourse of gameplay that are available with Vanishing Realms are a heck of a lot of fun. I often felt like I was playing the role Indiana Jones and the environments are absoluetly stunning in VR.

However, it is the room scale that really pushes the bar high. Being able to stroll around your own little space, lighting torches, peering over edges and looking through windows provides a gaming experience that I have simply never come close to having before. That isn't to say it is the best gaming I have ever had, it isn't; but it is so radically different to everything I have done before that comparing Vanishing Realms to any stadard monitor driven game would be like comparing apples and oranges. 

So, Vanishing Realms is short but awesomely entertaining.

The combat is also very done. I generally don't emjoy first person combat games. Call of Duty? No thanks, not for me. However, even though this is technically a first person RPG, I wouldn't have it any other way. If this is a taste of things to come, then I can safely say that the first person gaming was simply made for VR... it just started out a few years before the tech :) Having a skeleton stand right in front of you hammering his rusty blade in your face can be genuinely intimidating. However, being able to lift your own sword (not a mouse/keyboard but an actual physical object in your hand that is perfectly tracked) in order to parry those attacks and then being able to thrust it into it's head to deplete its health is incredibly satisfying.

Sadly, there is a slight negative because things turn a little bit less satisfying once you have equipped the bow and arrow. You see, the AI is not particularly good, and as long as you stay at a distance you can spam your arrows to kill the enemies and they won't even move towards you. They can strafe a little from time to time but as soon as I had the bow all the danger became almost completely inert and that was a real shame. In the end I just put the bow away and only used it when absolutely necessary, ie if enemies could not be reached via melee, but it seems like a silly thing to have to do to get the most enjoyment out of the game.

That said, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms to anybody who has a Vive. Feel free to watch my video (linked at the start of my review) for a general idea of what the game is about, but this won't even begin to give you a taster of the actual experience. The game is great, so I thank the developer for their efforts and I can't wait to see what will be coming next!

23123117,english,"10/10 The best gaming experience I have ever had, on any platform. Ever.

Let me start by saying, this is an early access game, which should make what I will say all the more impactful. Also, to set the context, I am in my mid 40's and remember playing Pong, getting an Atari 2600 in 1977 (coinciding with Star Wars, what a great year), owning Intellivision 1 and 2, Colecovision, NES, IBM PC jr, Commodore 64, XBOXes, PS's, you name it. I like games. I am an avid board gamer, I have designed games and was my groups Dungeon Master in D&D going back to 1980. In terms of VR, I backed DK1, bought a DK2, and own an Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive. I've played every TES game, All of the Ultimas (started with Ultima 2 when it came out.)

This is some next nevel shit....and by that I mean thanks to VR.  skipping some levels that should have somehow been in there in between. All credit to Palmer Lucky and other innovaters for what we are now able to experience. 

Now, some things to get out of the way about this game right now. Be warned, that unless you are someone who enjoys early access to games, this is not for you. I feel this warning should be READ before people buy these titles. It's right there in blue, but people seem to ignore it.

The game is too short at this time. The game does not have realistic monsters, or AAA title graphics. You MUST make sure to set up your Vive perfectly to get the most out of this, and by that I mean make sure your play area is well defined with a good amount of room. Mine is 2m x 2m and my gut tells me that is minimum to REALLY enjoy this game once you start swinging around your weapon. Make sure your hardware supports smooth frame rates with the Vive.

Once all of the finicky parts are set, you can launch into the game. I will say this again, but I don't like the look of the monsters- but I believe most younger gamers will prefer it. I like more ""serious"" looking monsters, just a preference. While you are walking around in the world and interacting with it, this won't matter at all. In the heat of combat, I found it almost startling how something that looks pretty standard on the monitor, can be intimidating once you are fitted into it's scaled den. I love the inventory system, where you only need to look down at your belt and pouches and grab what you need. Eat food to improve health, grab a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, or a staff, or a bow. The immersion factor is top notch. The weapons feel great. Ducking and side stepping ranged attacks feels phenomenal.

I will give you one example in the game to show you why this is the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.

Deep in the heart of a battle with 3 orcs and 2 floating magic users hurling magic fireballs at me, I hurried to a cluster of rocks. I crouched behind the rocks and watched as fireballs just missed me and singed the side of the rocks I was leaning against. I decided to try to pick off the high floating magic users first. I noted that each time I would attack the orcs, these damned MU's would heal them. I grabbed my trusty bow. I waited until a blast hurled past me. I leaned out just enough to see the enemies and focused on the one closest to me. I slowly drew back my arrow, and tried to aim just above the MU, keeping steady. I released the arrow and made a hit. I continued to pound him and when I got him low in HP, he began to heal himself. I knew I had to increase the rate of my hits. I found a better spot to attack him. A barrage of hits met their mark, and I took the first MU down. I used this tactic to take out the other MU, and had to sidestep his balls of fire while making my way to a tree that was good cover, but closer in range to him. Once I dispatched him, I put away my bow and healed up a bit as quickly as I could. I then drew my sword in my right hand, and my shield in the left. I rushed the orcs, and in a fit of slashes I dealt damage to them. I would use the shield to try to block attacks from one, while stabbing and slashing the others. I finally killed them all and took their treasure. I then made my way into a cave opening I spotted, stopping only to catch my breath.

Cons-
Short gameplay (at this point in early access)
Very small number of enemies
Combat can be a little easy (would be great if difficult levels could be added, increasing number, strength, and type of monsters)
Graphics -Not even so much the level of graphics, I prefer a more serious ""look"" to the monsters, similar to TES or old school D&D. However, I really don't care that much that it should detract from my rating. The environments look great.

Pros-
Immersive beyond anything else I have ever done
Pace is good
Just enough story to keep things moving (some more voice acting could be added but not a negative at all)
Inventory system
Weapons, while low in variety, feel great
Atmosphere, good visuals for VR and ambient sound

Summary - Even at this early stage, the greatest gaming experience I have ever had in terms of immersion and feeling as though I was IN a dungeon or ON a mountain etc. Once complete, with added length, variety and difficulty scaling, it will likely be the best entertainment experience (for me) in almost 40 years when I got into Star Wars.",76561198083101918,99,2,516,0,228,1482038401,1463858981,1463860217,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The interface for changing weapons and for accessing the inventory needs a bit more design.

Seriously this is why I bought VR. I had a grin from ear to ear the entire time I was playing this game. If you play this game the way it was meant to be played you will have an absolute blast!. You can of course try to cheat (saw a few videos of people exploiting) but if that's what you are going to do.. why did you buy VR?

I love the combat and with a couple wrist weights on my arm it turned into a realistic workout. I hope more content comes out and a few more monsters. I love what is in the game right now, I was ducking and weaving, the more space you can give this game the better it will play. That being said I was playing just under the 2m X 2m space but I was able to make due just fine, I just wish I had a bit more space.

If you are running room scale VR and always wanted to battle the undead with swords and shields or a bow and arrow then buy this game, seriously, do not hesitate. It may be a bit cartoony but it gets the job done. This is a dungeon crawl that seriously made me glad I bought the Vive over the competition.

Why are you still reading this? Adventures await! This game is worth it at double the price!

Edit - 

I have now used the Oculus Rift and room scale with this game as well as the HTC Vive. I would like to comment on how the game handles with the Rift. The Rift plays quite well with 3 sensor room scale. I did not have any issues at all. I was able to set up the Rift sensors to get good tracking even when on the ground, at times I felt I had better control on the ground with the Rift vs Vive. At no time did I feel any disconnect in the hour I played. I was quite pleased! I then attempted to use the game with only 2 sensors. I would highly not recommend this. This game requires full 360 tracking and 2 sensors will not give you 100%, I was able to get it to a playable level but I did run into disconnect issues with the controllers and it breaks the flow of the game.

If you have 3 sensor room scale for the Oculus Rift this game is a must have!!!!!",76561197971800011,682,27,297,0,176,1606193587,1463635583,1506828761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In simple terms; this game is fun!  It's a bit short, but I'm hoping for more content in the future.
It's the little things that stand out for me in this game. They make you feel as if you are actually holding a shield and a sword (or bow and arrow, etc). It really stands out when you compare it to some others like it; yes, you can just wave your sword around, but you can also actually use it!  On the last level, I was getting really good at going around their shields (or under or over) to kill in very few strokes.  The map accuracy for the bows and arrows were surprisingly accurate, allowing for hiding behind cover, aiming without looking (stretch the arms around the corner), dodging incoming arrows, and, for the slow, looking down at the arrows sticking out of you!  LOL, AND they move faithfully when you do, persisting long enough to be disconcerting!
I have now been spoiled; games that don't allow me to clash my sword on my shield really suck!  
The maps were also imaginative and fun, keeping you thinking and on your toes!  
I LOVED the inventory management in this one!  I had a bit of a problem with losing items in between saves, but nothing that mattered (which is probably why they disappeared).  Seriously, the inventory system is worth experiencing all by itself!

23031761,english,"This is one of my favorite VR games so far. I really hope we see more games like this in the future! 

Pros:
-I am a big fan of the item belt and really didn't have any issues with inventory management. I used the simple tactic of putting useful items like the pick and torch in my left pouch and put food and potions in the right pouch and it works like a charm.
-Love the feel and atmosphere of the game world, I spent a few minutes in each area just looking around. You really feel like you are in a dank dungeon or mine. 
-Combat is fun and a little channenging at times (especially against two or more foes). The hit detection could use a little work, but I imagine that its hard to get a virtual sword with 1:1 motion controls to work and feel right. After all the sword and the skelleton you are swinging at are not really there. Over all I was impressed with how fun the combat is. 
-The puzzles, while not hard, required some thought.
-Felt very much immersed in the game. This is one of those games you say ""Oh, Ill boot that up and play for 15 min."" and then end up pulling the headset off an hour later saying ""Wow! that was fun!""
-Felt like I was getting just a taster of what games will be like in a few years time. After my first hour in the game, I put it down and though ""I really hope we see a major AAA game in this style."" 
- Enemies feel intimidating and do protect themsevles well. They attempt to block or dodge arrows, and will cover up or step back if they are taking a beating. Also, watching my wife dancing across the room in an all out  fencing duel with thin air is always fun.
- Mini bosses and bosses were very fun and, I think, a great addition to the game. There are 6 types of enemies and each feel different and have different fighting styles/tactics. I found that killing them in the order of [spoiler] Healer -> Ranged -> melee [/spoiler] helped a lot, and was required in some fights. 

Cons:
- While satisfied with the game at the $20 asking price, I want more! I had a lot of fun playing this, and cant wait for the devs to make a sequel or similar. (beat the game in about 2 hours) 
- Sometimes when looking down at the inventory belt the HMD will slide up your face a tiny bit and make what you are trying to see blur. Not a huge problem and may not be an issue for people who can get their Vive securely glued to thier face. But with my giant head, I found myself reaching up and holding the Vive in place so I could see a few times.
- Because you are swinging the controllers around and moving quite a bit to dodge fireballs and arrows the game tries to keep you in the center of the play area so you dont hit something. This causes the game to pause with a screen that tells you to return to the center of the room and press pause to resume. While a fantastic idea so I dont break things, it does cut into the immersion a bit, sometimes popping up in the middle of a fight. a larger play area would probably help this a lot.

But if you have a Vive, this title is well worth it as there is nothing else like it.

It is quite fun to beat up skeletons in swordfights. One thing that could have made it better would be if the AI was a bit better. Right now the enemies just stand there even if you are fighting one of their buddies literally 2 m away. It would be ok if they would pull from a larger radius so you would get a couple more fights where you face more than one at a time.
Also, the bow. The bow right now is sort of overpowered due to infinite arrows, and enemies at a distance will most of the time just stand there while you shoot at them over and over until they die - even if there is a fairly obvious path to you, and even if it's a ""boss"". Perhaps making arrows a limited resource would help. E.g. you could loot some arrows from the arrow-filled skeletons you find, and the bowmen you kill. On the other hand that means there should be some other way to kill bowmen on unreachable ledges (orberhaps you will be forced to just dodge them).",76561197967766756,296,18,358,0,165,1475422057,1463431500,1463431500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Fast ein Jahr ist vergangen seitdem ich mein Review hier geschrieben habe. Jetzt möchte ich es auffrischen:

Vanishing Realms ist sicherlich ein sehr gutes VR RPG (wobei die allgemeine Liste der VR RPGs recht klein ist) aber dennoch hat dass Spiel auch ein paar Macken, später mehr dazu.

Ich brauchte knapp 2.5 Stunden um das gesamte Spiel durch zu spielen (dabei habe ich sehr langsam gespielt und mir jede Ecke des Games genauer angeschaut). Das SPIEL (keine Erfahrung!) ist im allgemeinen das Geld wert aber nachdem die Storykomponente einmal beendet wurde gibt es keinen Wiederspielwert denn alle Items wurden bereits erbeutet und ich logge mich nicht nochmal ein nur weil ich einen Erfolg haben möchte, den ich bekomme wenn ich 50 Kerzen angezündet habe.



[H1]Negativ[/H1]

- Kein Wiederspieltwert! Du wirst das Spiel vermutlich nicht nochmal starten nachdem du die Story abgeschlossen hast. Es wäre sehr schön gewesen wenn sich der Developer ein System hätte einfallen lassen, dass den Spieler auch nach Beendigung der Story weiterhin beschäftigt.

- Es gibt lediglich eine einzige Möglichkeit sich Fortzubewegen (Teleport). Gerade in Kampfsituation hätte ich mir gewünscht nicht erst nach einem Platz zum teleportieren suchen zu müssen.

- Das ständige Bücken (wenn man so wie ich jedes Goldstück aufheben will) ist wirklich nicht sehr freundlich. Der Loot sollte immer in Spielerhöhe leicht zu greifen sein.

- Das Userinterface ist so lala, es funktioniert zwar, wird aber zum Ende des Spieles unglaublich unübersichtlich und überfüllt sich. So greift man schließlich anstatt zum Schwert dann doch zum Bogen oder Zauberstab.

- Monster droppen nur Gold/Mana. Ich hätte mir sehr gewünscht das Monster (gerade die Stärkeren) auch Ausrüstung droppen (so wäre eine wirklich Klassische RPG Komponente abgedeckt).

- Kein Aufleveln.

- Die Story wird nur auf Englisch (kein leicht verständliches Englisch) und über In-Game Texte erzählt.

- Gelegentliche Bildfehler beim Teleportieren (vor allem wenn man sich draußen Aufhält).

- Relativ niedrig aufgelöste Texturen (Der Stil ist trotzdem stimmig aber es könnte deutlich besser sein). Ich vermute das an sehr vielen Stellen Assets gekauft und benutzt wurden (völlig i.O und verständlich).



[H1]Positiv[/H1]

- Die Story lässt sich ganz gut spielen aber geht definitiv unter wegen dem herausragendem Kampfsystem

- Die allgemeine Stimmung im Spiel wird sehr gut umgesetzt. Man hat immer das Gefühl von einer ""höheren Macht"" beobachtet zu werden.

- Stimmige Soundeffekte mit Hall etc.

- Man kann mit sehr vielen Objekten interagieren, so lassen sich zum Beispiel Fässer zerstören und Heuhaufen und Banner in Brand setzen.

- Überall sind kleine Pokale versteckt die man sich erbeuten kann. Im Grunde wird man für alles was man in Brand setzt oder zerstört belohnt.



[H1]Fazit[/H1]

Ich empfehle jedem Spieler der sich für RPGs interessiert Vanishing Realms auszuprobieren. Das Geld ist das Spiel defintiv wert und vor kurzem gab der Developer bekannt, dass er nun an der dritten Erweiterung arbeitet. Wer dauerhaften Spaß sucht sollte erst noch abwarten um zu sehen ob der Entwickler daran arbeitet einen Wiederspielwert in das Spiel einzubauen.

Alles in allem gibt es von mir eine Kaufempfehlung und eine Bewertung mit 7/10 Sternen.


Für die, die Vanishing Realms schon durch gespielt haben und jetzt auf neuen Content warte, hier meine Spieletipp: Trickster VR (ähnlich zu Vanishing Realms aber mehr Fokus auf Kampf und Waffen).

This has been the single best experience I've ever had in gaming - by a wide margin. Not just VR, everything.

Tips to super-enjoying this:

1. Let yourself be immersed. Try and BE the character you're playing. I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there.
2. Move around frequently in your play-space. Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often. So just make sure you shift around a lot. Be free.
3. If you do 1. right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they're going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit. It'll put the hairs up on the back of your neck.

Legit criticisms:

1. AI is pretty crap in this. Enemies aren't smart and just sit there staring at you even though you're only 2 meters away.
2. AI fights incredibly slowly. This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing.
3. AI doesn't really adapt to your fight style - I'm sure this will be fixed in other games given time. But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land.
4. Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn't matter too much since you get lost in the moment.
5. MOAR CONTENT! Left me desperate for more.

Conclusion:

This is the single best entertainment experience I've ever had. This game is amazing. It's a cliche, but seriously: this game is a must-have.

22913611,english,"This is the first ever review I have written for a game on Steam.  I was motivated to write it because, out of all the VR games I own, this has been the most fun and awe-inspiring experience on the HTC Vive to date.  It's basically a Zelda-like game where you are actually inside the dungeon.  I own many other VR games and in my opinion this is way better than Job Simulator and the Lab, which feel more like VR tech demos.  Vanishing Realms is a very short game.  I was able to complete the available content in a little less than 3 hours or so.  It does have a lot of interesting mechanics and once you get used to the movement and combat, it is one of those games that make you salivate about what the future of VR has in store.  I am not going to describe the game itself, as you can get that from the Store page.  I will describe the experience though.  

The initial chapter of the game sees your character locked inside a dungeon that you must try to escape by finding keys, following hints in riddles or defeating various types of enemies.  It is very immersive, and you really feel as if you are inside this world, to the point that I often found myself swinging my ""sword"" outside the playable area and bashing my furniture (make sure you have enough room to play as the game suggests a larger playing area than most other games).  Fighting multiple enemies is fun and sometimes challenging, as enemies will change their attack patterns after a bit and dodge your arrows and magic attacks.  The weapons right now are limited to three different swords and a hammer for melee, two different bows and a fire magic wand for ranged attacks.  Enemies vary based on their abilities and you will find yourself fighting skeleton warriors, archers, mages (as well as healers) and a few bigger baddies and bosses.  Once you complete the initial dungeon, you are teleported to an arena-style area where you have to defeat all the enemies within a time limit in order to complete the game.  The game has various checkpoints whereby you can save your progress by walking over them.

I own several other VR games such as Holopoint, VR Minilands Golf, Job Sim, the Lab, The Blue, etc (just check my game list).  Vanishing Realms doesn't have a high replayability index, but is a way better experience for the price than many other VR games available now.  The only downsides to this game are its brevity, the lack of guidance at certain points (although it's not that hard to figure out) and the semi-ambiguous ending, although it does seem like the developer is working on more content.  I have to say that at this point, this is the only VR game I own that I have been motivated to play all the way through.

Again, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who owns the Vive and wants to get a good idea of what VR can potentially offer in a gaming experience.  I really felt like I was inside this world and I would be completely immersed in the fights and the game mechanics.  Some things could still use a bit of polish but I definitely think this is an experiencee worth checking out if you are into VR.",76561197971732951,637,5,284,0,263,1474695350,1462984619,1462984619,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Made by an ex-Valve dev (yes, singular), Vanishing Realm puts players into, quite literally, the boots of a lone adventurer, armed only with his/her wits and thirst for adventure. The cartoony nature of the game may seem like a mood breaker for some, but trust me when I say all these will go away once you hold the sword in your hand for the first time, or when you that huge skeleton swung its flail right above your head as you franctically ducked instinctively.

The battle was fluid and engaging, requiring players to parry, dodge and attack with good timing and precision. However, once you get used to the mechanics, it can get a little too easy, even in boss fights. The variety of weapons is also quite limited at this time as the game is still in early access.

After about an hour in this game my legs ached from walking/ducking/dodging, my arms were tired from fighting monsters, and my character’s health was low so I took a break by sitting on my bedroom floor under a beautiful tree. Leaves fell all around me. Birds were chirping. The wind was blowing. Particles swam in a sunbeam. I reached into my virtual satchel, pulled out an apple, brought it to my mouth, and slowly “ate” it as it replenished my health. Sitting there regaining my virtual and real-life stamina was the most peaceful, beautiful, and interconnected experience I have ever had with technology. Half-man, half-machine. Nirvana through escapism. By the way, I opened my mouth to eat the apple and hit my teeth with the controller. I've also tried to set my controllers on tables that don't exist multiple times.

22873304,english,"This game is excellent. Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!

One thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times. I play in a 8ft by 10.5ft play area. Many of the other games I've played will utilize the location of the monitor/computer in the room and set the default facing direction as away from the monitor.

The game takes about 2 hours to finish. That said I wouldn't consider the game worth its current price with its currently limited amount of content. To justify the price I believe the final product (after early access ends) should have have at least two or three times as much gameplay as what we can currently enjoy in the first two chapters. I mean paying $10 per hour for first play-through content is a little rediculous. 

I also felt that some of the game's design elements were created to keep the early access beyond Steam's 2 hour refund period. For example time-consuming use of a mining-pick to obtain gold (which is neccessary to proceed), as well as the cryptic hints on how to proceed to the end of each chapter or how to pass through certain doorways.",76561197960366142,151,20,169,0,169,1463019218,1462758067,1462761805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

22837414,english,"Although I haven't completed it yet, I really enjoyed this game. There hasn't been a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or disoriented in the time I have played.

The combat is a little slow paced but I suppose it is for the better after trying other games that had fast paced combat which can make you feel uncomfortable and outright dangerous if designed wrong especially when fights get so intense that you forget about your chaperone bounds.

The cable you are tethered to also hampers your movement so I can't move quickly comfortably because I am always worried about tripping over the wire or smacking into a wall despite the chaperone warning which is often neglected in really heated moments. So I find it good that this game took a slower paced approach.

But the combat was far from snail paced, It was quite entertaining dueling with archers and sword skeletons, trading steel and arrows, dodging and blocking, and taking cover.

The AI though not the smartest in the world somehow seemed to react to my actions, sword fighters sometimes try to pull a fient on you dodging your attacks and swiftly counterattacking for instance. If you try to cheese the game with a bow from a distance eventually your foes start to dodge them.

The foes seem to have a set distance at which they will engage you, the fights are a little slower paced which I don't mind since you have time to plan your next move and don't run out of space as easily.

I found the level design to be nice and clever but far from flawless, there were some places where I felt a disconnect. For instance trying to telport from a ledge to an archer that has been harassing me but it would only allow me to teleport to this one specific little spot on the ground without any visual cues so I was sitting there for ages figuring out how to get there.

I found the inventory system to be quite intuitive, though sometimes it sticks out like a sore thumb when interacting with objects beneath you.

The art style was beautiful despite the simple cartoony looking graphics. Looks pretty good in VR, I loved the god rays coming out of the windows early on in the game. The skyboxes can use some work though.

The puzzles I've encountered so far are nice, but very short and simple.

22836127,english,"I'm having a hard time coming deciding what to say about this game. It's basically Zelda-light in VR. It has so many elements that are really good, but not perfect, though the combination of them in one game is great. 

Swordplay feels fantastic, parrying with a sword is just as fun as you could imagine, and blocking with a shield only to then stab the skeleton in between the armor and the shield like in 300 is crazy fun. 

The loot system where you actually destroy things and then grab the loot is great, the new inventory system (essentially a belt) works pretty well, and is decently unobtrusive. 

The other weapons that I won't spoil are OK, but could be better. The puzzles work pretty well, though the traps, while cool looking, didn't really seem to work for me with teleporting. 

Overall, this is a game with a lot of very cool elements. It makes me more excited for VR's potential than probably any other game I've played. As I said before, nothing is quite perfect... but everything is pretty good. The only real criticism is, of course, the length of the game. My play-time is inflated because 2 people have played it.

22823440,german,"Vanishing Realms ist das erste 'echte' Roomscale-Spiel dass ich probiert habe.

Man bewegt sich im Dungeon bzw. in der zugehörigen Umgebung, und insbesondere die Innenräume vermitteln den Eindruck von Räumen in denen man sich befindet. Es erinnert an die alten Eye-of-the-Beholder, in denen man sich jetzt mittendrin befindet. Oder ein wenig ein 3d-mittendrin-Zelda.

Die Welt ist nicht riesig, und es geht relativ linear vorwärts . Aber das fällt während dem Spiel nicht weiter auf.
RPG-Teil gibt es quasi keinen, VR ist eher ein Dungeon-Crawler.

Auch wenn es etliche Punkte für 'hier geht noch was' gibt, ist VR eine runde Sache. Durch den Blick auf alte  PC-Titel liegt evtl. die Messlatte auch zu hoch für eine 'neutrale' Betrachtung. Alles in allem ist VR für Freunde von Dungeon-Spielen allemal einen Blick wert, wenn nicht sogar ein MUST-HAVE.

Soweit das 'ursprüngliche' Spiel, Chapter 1.

Das hinzugekommene Chapter 2 besteht leider nur aus einer grafisch netten, aber 'passiven' Burg und einem Kampfstrang, bestehend aus 9 zeitbegrenzten Einzelteilen.

Die Kämpfe und deren Mechanik sind super implementiert, und man geht ganz im Geschehen auf. Die präzise Mechanik im Nahkampf demonstriert eindrucksvoll den Gewinn an Spielqualität mit getrackten Controllern.

Ich hatte allerdings dabei das Problem, dass mein Spielbereich mit 2.5x2.5m zu klein für die Schwertkämpfe ist und ich regelmässig Wände und Einrichtung getroffen habe, trotz dauerhafter Bodenmarkierung und Rücken an der Grenze. Und mit Gegnern von hinten geht selbst das nicht.

Mein Tip: mit weniger als 3m Platz eignet man sich besser von vornherein einen Kampfstiel mit einem Bewegungsradius von Essbesteck an. In Eifer des Gefechts im Ausfallschritt mit gestrecktem Arm den Controller in eine Wand oder teures Mobiliar zu hämmern geht verdammt schnell. Die vielgerühmte Immersion mit Roomscale tut hier perfekt ihren Dienst.

Insgesamt ist das zweite Kapitel nett für einen Durchgang und , aber ich hätte lieber mehr von Art des ersten Kapitels gehabt.

22749551,french,"Il est très difficile de noter un jeu de ce type, mon avis est mitigé, mais le résultat est sans appel : c'est la première fois que je demande à me faire rembourser un jeu sur Steam.
Alors oui l'univers est assez bien modélisé, c'eet sympa de vraiment taper avec une épée comme on le ferait en vrai, mais le jeu a pour moi deux défauts majeurs : 
- la téléportation
- l'absence de scénario

Pour la téléportation beaucoup diront que c'est le choix majoritairement retenu par les développeurs. Alors oui dans un Budget Cuts ou un The Lab ça fonctionne sans soucis c'est vrai. Mais Budget Cuts étant un jeu d'infiltration on ne peut pas abuser de ce déplacement et TheLab... ça n'est pas vraiment un jeu. Ici on se retrouve à ,pouvoir traverser toute la map en restant debout sans même faire un pas, en passant au milieu de tous les pièges en parcourant des kilomètres en quelques secondes !! Du grand n'importe quoi. AU minimum aurait-il fallu mettre en place un système de stamina pour éviter de pouvoir cliquer à gogo, pouvoir fuire les combats (les ennemis n'essaynt mlême pas de vous poursuivre) sans craintes. Ce style de jeu doit trouver une autres mécanique que celle-là.

Pour le scénario (alors bon je ne suis pas bilingue et des détails m'ont échapper à la lecture des parchemins en ""intro"") il est quasi inexistant :( pour un RPG c'est vraiment dommage quand même. Il y a un embryon de scénario mais rien de convainquant.

Alors oui, le jeu est hyper immersif, c'est jouissif (les premières minutes) de se balader dans cet univers en marchant, mais franchement c'est plus une démo technique qu'un vrai jeu et en plus je ne suis pas convaincu.

Le jeu a du potentiel mais doit fortement évoluer pour avoir un pouce en l'air.",76561197987784229,602,3,39,0,39,1461615292,1462131742,1462131742,False,2,0,0.43413117527961731,2,True,False,True
22748311,english,"Wow. Have only played 20 minutes on this game, but this is what I was always looking for in VR. Think Zelda in style, going around collecting gems and loot with a flame torch in one hand and a sword in the other

The teleport system that is being used with VR seems solid... but with games like this, that looks so convincing in VR, I just want to walk and walk and walk. It would be cool to see some kind of game design that employs Unseen Diplomacy’s technique of room control. Anyway, that is more a criticism of how unbelievably convincing VR is, and how much of a shame it is when you see the Chaperone Boundaries come up.
If you are new to the Vive, buy this now. Best game I have played on it yet, and actually feels like a game rather than a tech demo.

EDIT:

Chapter 2 is dreadful... it really left a sour taste in my mouth to the entire experience. Gone is the wonderful RPG exploration with puzzles, in is a battle area with time limit. It feels like the poorest excuse of level padding and it really wasn't fun. When it gets to the end, I wasn't even sure it was the end and wasted lots of time trying to find out what I have to do next. I really want to see the dev change this, otherwise this review will turn to negative once the game leaves EA.

EDIT 2 (in Progress

The update has made the combat much much harder and much more fun. Unfortuatly you can beat the game by crouching (the AI can't cope with it). Vast improvement in smashable objects and little puzzles (such as throwing rocks to knock down goblets etc). This update puts me back in positive mind set about the Developer, although I am not looking forward to ""chapter 2""... hopefully it has also been updated in a good direction.

Update: I've seen a lot of (to be honest, expected) recent reviews complain about the DLC being paid. I can understand this complaint, as the original game was Early Access and was also pretty short for the cost of the game. I don't think that the developer is being ""greedy"" as some suggest, but I do think it is a major mistake to charge for what is essentially the remainder of the base game.

A somewhat foolish PR mistake for sure - but it doesn't change the fact that this is still one of my favourite VR experiences to date. It is also true, though, that Karnage Chronicles might be a better alternative if you don't already have the base Vanishing Realms.

Seems to me a Steam sale at 50% plus the DLC for free for the first few weeks would have done a better job at onboading new players (and raising more cash), without unduly annoying original supporters of this game.

22684994,german,"Vanishing Realms ist mein erstes Spiel, welches ich mir für die Vive dazu gekauft habe. Bei der allgemeinen Preisbalance wo die VR Spiele liegen, hab ich lange hin und her überlegt. Mein alltime Fav. Game ist Dark Souls. Also wollte ich etwas zum erkunden, sowie ein brauchbares Kampfsystem. Vanishing Realms bietet sowas im kleinen. Das Kampfsystem KANN ordentlich genutzt werden, aber auch ein rumgefuchtel wie bei Wii-Titel führt zum Erfolgt und erledigten Gegner. Ich rate für die Immersion trotzdem ordentlich zu spielen, was den Spielspaß erhöht. Das Erkunden ist beim erstmal richtig richtig klasse, flacht aber beim erneuten Spielen schneller ab. Da nichts random platziert wird. Aber das ist okay, würde man jedem anderen Single-Playertitel auch nicht ankreiden. Jedoch wirkt ein erneuter Durchlauf, weniger spannend. Daher sei dies angemerkt.
Der WoW-Look ist gut gewählt bei der momentanen Performance situation. Es verbreitet Stimmung, aber keine Panik beim erkunden der Gemäuer. Ein kleiner Jumpscare zum Anfang. Der aber wirklich nicht der rede wert ist ist auch dabei. Ich liebe Horrorfilme sowie Spiele, und das genannte Dark Souls hat natürlich auch viele solcher verstörenden Elemente. Jedoch wirkt in VR so etwas immer noch eine Ecke krasser und Intensiver. Daher bin ich froh, dass dieses Game nie zu dunkel oder zu furchteinflössend daher kommt. Es macht Spaß, sich eine Fackel zu greifen und hier und da ein bisschen Indiana Jones art die Gänge zu beleuchten, auch wenn dies nie notwendig ist. Da alles hell genug bleibt. Man macht es trotzdem und man fühlt sich wieder ein paar Jahre jünger und baut sich ein Spiel im Spiel damit. 

Ich habe zu diesem Zeitpunkt den ersten Akt in gut einer Stunde durchgespielt. Was auch wirklich mein persönliches Limit war. 
- Das Erkunden (soweit möglich von meinem Wohnzimmer), funktioniert mit RoomSkaling und blinking bzw. teleportieren zu neuen Abschnitten kombiniert wirklich gut. Auch rückwärts, um sich platz zu schaffen, wenn Gegner vor einem stehen. Macht man dies zuu schnell verspürt man gerade gegen Ende ein wenig Übelkeit. Aber alles im Rahmen und verglichen mit dem, was ich mit dem Dev-Kit1 der OR damals durchgemacht habe. Ein Kinderspiel. Man ertappt sich dabei, wie man hier und dort unter Möbeln schaut und jede Ecke untersuchen möchte. Ob nicht doch noch irgendwo etwas versteckt ist.
- Das Kämpfen funktioniert wie schon gesagt gut, kann aber auch in fuchtellei ausatmen. Gerade wenn man seine persönliche Pause machen will, bzw. einfach nur noch den Akt beenden will, weil man erschöpft ist. Die KI ist wirklich nicht der rede Wert, die Skelette fuchteln ein wenig, schreien dich an (perfekter Zeitpunkt um ins Auge zu stechen) und schwingen ihr Schwert aus 2 Richtungen. Ansonsten bleiben sie hinter ihren Schild und warten eher das man auf sie zu kommt. Was gut ist. Denn in VR wird vieles schnell hektisch: ""Wo bin ich gerade im RL? Hoffentlich ist vor mir nicht der Fernsehr, kurz umschalten zur Kamera. Neu Positionieren. Kabel richten. Okay weiter gehts!"" Solche Momente wird man hier alle 2 min erleben, gerade wenn man nur etwa 3x2 Meter platz hat. Ich habe fast meine Freundin aufm Sofa einmal getroffen. Gerade wenn man voll dabei ist. Oder nur ein paar Münzen sammeln will. Daher ist es gut, dass die Gegner eher passiv agieren und dem Spieler sehr viele Chancen bieten. Ich denke das ist ein guter Kompromiss, zwischen Spielspaß und Sicherheit.
- Die Technik dahinter. Ich mag mich täuschen, aber ich glaube vieles ist Asset, was im Unitystore angeboten wird. Aber das macht mir nichts. Man muss den WoWartigen Look aber mögen. Dafür bleibt die Performance auch meist Stabil. Bei zu vielen Lichtquellen hatte ich hier und da ein zucken gesehen. Was aber auch an meiner 770 GTX (4gb vram) liegen kann. Die Eingaben funktionieren tadellos und man merkt, dass sich viele Gedanken gemacht wurden. Einzig das man nicht runterfallen kann, wenn man sich auf Kisten portet finde ich etwas schade. Aber eine Kleinigkeit. Was mich mehr stört ist das Speichersystem, was eher Checkpointartig funktioniert. Ich hatte mal einen Soundausfall und wollte Steam neu starten und stand wieder vor New Game. Tut nicht not. 


Unterm Strich möchte ich Jedem Vanishing Realms empfehlen, der einmal als Ritter Dungeons erkunden möchte. Die Spielzeit mag (momentan) kurz wirken und der Wiederspielwert gen Null. Jedoch muss man sich vor Augen führen, dass VR nach einer Stunde schon anstrengend ist. Ich denke Sessions werden niemals 4-6 Stunden in Angriff nehmen. Zumindest wenn man so aktiv agiert wie hier. Und auch wenn man nach einem mal Spielen alles gesehen hat, denke ich schaut man vielleicht hin und wieder noch mal rein, um ein paar Monster zu metzeln. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. Ich bin gespannt ob und was noch alles nachgeliefert wird. Aber es fühlt sich jetzt schon wie ein richtiges Spiel an, was das wichtigste erfüllt. Es macht Spaß!",76561197985755471,373,6,182,0,150,1463404573,1461833051,1461833051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
22681233,english,"I think this may be my first review (just saw I also reviewed Orion Prelude....ha).  There's so many things I want to say about this game.  For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game.  I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer’s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything.

When I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game.  When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game.  Heck, when I read books...I wanted them to be this game.  This game is not Morrowind or Diablo.  It's not any of those things.  This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic. 

It has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game.  Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization.  This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG.  But it doesn't matter.  We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one.  This is as close as you can get right now.

My only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short.

Remember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote?  Remember when you bought a Playstation move and for a few hours thought it was awesome until you realized that, meh, not that great?  Remember when you wanted to be playing this game?  Well, lucky for you, this is that game.

Buy it, support it, and get on the Dev's nerves about making it better and better.  I love this game.

22657495,english,"Early Access Watcher Reviews Vanishing Realms: Rite of Steel for HTC Vive

Update Version: Initial Release

Disclosure: The game copy was bought by the reviewer.

Before going into this review, it might be a good idea to hold a disclaimer over the rest of the talking points. I tested this game sitting down in a office desk chair and had to use my upper body to move. This game thankfully allows movement using the controller, teleporting you from one spot on the floor to another. You will need to have the HTC Vive in Room scaling mode to play this game and it was a bit of a challenge to play sitting down, but I will assure all the talking points will cover the universal approach and in no way will my reliability of a chair affect the opinion. That said, let us get to the main question. Is this RPG the grand attraction suited to introduce the functionality of the HTC Vive or is it another newcomer that might have gone on stage prematurely?

The dungeon and graveyard look astounding with a style similar to one of the latter Zelda games. Little cracks cover the walls and the wood bearings show off wear and tare. Skeletons are detailed beautifully with shields riddled with arrows and bruised dents in their armour. It really stood out the entire time I was playing it and I found myself more than once stopping to enjoy the atmosphere. It works very well to establish the mood, even if the actual inhabitants look more cartoonish than frightening. The music was a side note, painfully masked by the louder ambient noises of box hits, enemy strikes and arrow flings. I tried finding a way to change the volume, but I might have missed it. 

The tutorial is a welcome feature and covers the basics such as moving and picking up items. The rest of the features are rather self explanatory except for maybe the wand usage which as of now can be annoying when you attempt to put it away only to blast yourself with it. Items range from health potions, torches, a pick axe, food and puzzle items. Gold, jewels, mana stones, ore (from mining) and chalices add to the currency system used to buy weapons and potions. There are also ruby chalices hidden throughout the dungeon to collect for an achievement, but it also provides gold and mana. It is simple enough to pick up items and the only issues with it are being close enough to reach, but with the teleport movement style I have not had an issue reaching anything. UI consists of slots that appear around your waist and include categories for weapons, potions, wand, bow and items. The item slot is a bit annoying when trying to grab certain items (have to go through each item until you get the one you need) and you cannot drop items. There is a limit to how many items you can carry so unless you stockpiled on fruits before grabbing the pick axe, you should be fine.

Combat is a typical hack and slash standoff against skeletons and ghosts. As long as the enemy can see you and are in range, they will attempt to hit you as a group (space must be available to accommodate multiple melee so bottlenecking into a short gap is usually recommended). Weapons and a shield are either bought or found and weapons range from swords, bows (use off hand to pull back arrow), hammer or a wand (uses mana and you point, hold trigger and release). Dual wielding is possible as well as parrying to deal with melee hits, but the shield is crucial against arrows and moving is the only way to avoid fireballs. It is very simplistic in nature with the majority just being massive flailing of the controller, but it is recommended to time attacks and use movement to gain a upper hand. It can get very tiring during the fights later on. Death is not to harsh on the player at least. 

The look and feel of the game cannot overcome the barren amount of content though. Going through the first level can take about 30-45 minutes if you are going slow and the arena style matches can keep that stretched to about an hour and fifteen. There is a total of 11 ruby chalices to collect and 33 ore spots to harvest for achievements, but all of this can be done in one pass if you look half-effort. It can be hard for some to make it the whole way in one play through with the forty plus monsters you so thankfully their is checkpoint saving, but if someone wants to play, they either start where you left off or erase the entire save and start from the beginning. Outside of this, there were some random moments I experienced missing frames and was kicked out of the game to the Vive menu (it started were I left off when I entered the app again). 

During my second play through, the game starting feeling like an endurance test over anything else. The simple wonder of discovering what was behind the next corner really helped keep the magic alive during the first play through. I still enjoyed the scenery, but when I already knew what to expect it just felt boring. With only about an hour of gameplay and little replay value, it is hard to recommend when other products have so much more meat on their bones. I am eager to see what happens next, but for now it would be better to wait until a few more chapters at least justify the entry price.

The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat. 

The melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion. 

The game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.

22627084,german,"Leute, was für eine Erfahrung ... Ich war ja schon immer ein RPG Fan, aber welche Art von RPGs möglich sind in VR hat mich echt weggeblasen. 
Die ganzen VR Komponenten finde ich hier einfach super durchdacht: Ich habe einen virtuellen Gürtel um die Taille, der alle Waffen, Tränke, Zauber und sonstigen Gegenstände aufbewahrt, daher kann ich auch ein relativ komplexes Inventar recht schnell verwalten - Das Winzige, was ich mir wünschen würde, wäre eine Art Oberfläche, in der ich meinen gesamten Gürtelinhalt verwalten könnte - wobei ich auch sehe, dass das Immersion kosten könnte. Auch verhält sich der Gürtel manchmal etwas komisch, irgendwie scheint er manchmal die Taille entlang zu rutschen, aber das könnte auch daran liegen, dass ich meine 2 Sensorboxen noch nicht fest verankert und ausgerichtet habe.

Das Laufen über die Teleportierfunktion ist auch sehr gut gelößt: Ich kann mich nicht einfach auf den nächsten Berg oder an einem Gegner vorbei teleportieren - leider kann ich aber einem Gegner entfliehen damit, da die Teleportation einfach viel schneller als jeder Gegner ist. Auch habe ich einen begrenzten Teleportastionsradius, der so ein bisschen die übliche ""Schrittlänge"" wiederspiegelt - man denke hier an Old-School Dungeonm Crawler wie Legend of Grimrock. Eine recht immersive Lösung, die Motion Sickness entgegenkommt. Wobei ich persönlich lieber eine Motion-Sickness gefährliche Lösung wie das ""dashen"" hätte, da ich in dem Punkt sehr unempfindlich bin und das meine Immersion steigern würde, aber nun gut - man kann auch nicht Alles haben und man will das Spiel ja auch verkaufen.

22574953,english,"I am a long time Zelda fan (still have both games on my N64). That being said, this game is amazing. If you ever wanted to feel like you have been thrown into a Zelda game(literally), this is the game for you. Yes it is in early access and yes there are some minor issues like inventory management. But the came had way too many pros for such minor details to stop me. I played all of the Early Access content in one sitting, probably not a good idea, but I was addicted. It was one of the most immersive games in VR I have played so far. I didn't want to leave! Anyways here are some of the Pros and Cons I experienced, it may not be the same for everybody.

Pros++++++
-Immersive gameplay
- You get to hack and slash your enemies( or disintegrate them with fire!)
- Different weapons to suit your gamestyle(Archer, Knight, and Mage all mixed into one person)
- Fun exploration and beautiful artwork/surroundings
- A little bit of puzzle solving but nothing difficult
- You feel like you are actually wielding whatever weapon you choose!
- Some fun trap elements
- Addicting( I don't know if this is a pro or con)
- Some fun mini-boss and boss battles

Cons- - - - - (take lightly, it is still early access)
- Inventory system can be annoying. I wanted to navigate back to my torch but since I picked up practically everything I saw I had to spam my inventory until the correct item appeared.
- You need an ample amount of space of at least 2m x 2m.( not a problem for me, but could be for those with small areas)
- Not much else when it comes to cons.

Personal recommendation:  I wish some of the puzzles were a little more difficult to really add a challenge! (Again, still early access)

Well all things aside I do recommend this game for those that love the dungeon crawling and puzzle solving games. Or in other words, if you liked Zelda, you will like this game.

Aqui os traigo lo que yo llamo el ANALISIS D.I.T.

DIVERSION:

El juego es increhiblemente divertido, realmente te sientes como un heroe, especialmente cuando te cargas al primer esqueleto usando la espada.

INMERSION: 

La inmersion es total. Realmente he recorrido esas mazmorras, y me he sentido parte de esa fantasia.  Al principio pensaba que el teletransporte iba a sacarme de la inmersion, pero en cuanto empiezas a preocuparte por que bicho te va a salir, se te olvida por completo los controles.
De hecho cuando estaba ahi dentro, yo en mi mano tenia una espada y un escudo, no tenia los controles.

TENSION: 

Digamos que tiene una tension media alta al principio del juego, en el que no sabes que monstruo te va a salir ni cuando.  Despues esa tension baja, y en realidad estas deseando que halla mas monstruos para luchar contra ellos. En cualquier caso, luchar contra un esqueleto guerrero cansa.

RECOMENDACION: SI, SI SI...  Jugarlo en cuanto podais. Yo me he sentido como un verdadero heroe exporando unas mazmorras. El coger la esapda en tu mano, y el sentir que puedes derrotar a estos monstruos con ella, es brutal y cuando tienes el arco en las manos te siente legolas total.

22528158,english,"One of the best experiences for the Vive available right now, but some of the squandered potential makes you craving more. 

The combat system is a bit clunky. I wish there was a greater feeling of weight to swinging the sword. Obviously design choices were made, but I'd rather not see virtual objects ever 'go through' other virtual objects even if it means disassociating the held object with your actual hand. In Job Simulator for instance, if you hold a mug and put your hand through a table the mug is stopped by the table and your hand continues through. Not only should your sword be physically blocked by an enemy shield but there should be a momentum calculation as well. One of the primary differences of the Vive from the Wii is that the controllers are tracked 1:1, real momentum calculations are possible; otherwise the combat will just feel gimmicky.

Another criticism would be the dreadful inventory system which the developer has already said he is going address.

Long review:
Played around two hours and I think I had a bug which meant I couldn't progress and had to restart once. For a game which is Early Access that's pretty good in my book.

The combat is really fun. 
- The Bow + Arrow combo is well balanced but could be much better if Van. R. adapts the system from Valve's The Lab instead of the one they are using. 
- Hammer and Sword are cool but they could feel a bit more ""round"". Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.
- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there's vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It's just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the shit out of his strikes.
- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.

General movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that's not so bad and can be turned off.

Some minor quirks with how far monsters ""back off"" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that's still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way.

However, the core of this game is really fun and I really like the art style, world design, and lore that has started to be developed.  I was sad when I finished this because I wanted more. 

If people are complaining that they can just teleport almost inside, and the waggle the sword around then I feel like that is one them for now.  Hopefully the enemies will be pushed back in the future.  For now, you can just teleport in front of them and then trade blows, blocks, and dodges the way it was intended to be played.  At one point near the end when it gets kind of hectic, I accidentally grabbed my old sword instead of my shield.  I didn't have enough time to switch back so I was duel wielding swords for awhile, and that was a lot of fun trying to move around and strike twice every time I saw an opening.

I did not understand the ending though: probably there is a bug at the end of Chanpter 2.

- Not an intuitive way to cycle through inventory, unless I am missing something. I'd be great to see a visual list and choose exactly what I want
- Combat feedback consistency. I share the comments of someone else. It was hard to know sometimes if I was engaging in combat effectively. Hits that would register once would then be blocked. Or blocks that worked once would fail.
- It's easy to move around a lot during a battle, and its a little to easy to get out of the games tracking focus. Would be great if it could be a little more forgiving with room scale movement

In Vanishing Realms, I can stand in place and teleport everywhere.  Budget Cuts had me walking around, taking cover, and peeking around corners *in addition to*** the teleport system.  

The combat is awful.  The first skeleton was a bit creepy, but after that I just teleported into their faces and waved my sword around until they died.  Again, to compare, there was one instance in Budget Cuts in which I unexpectedly had a robot creep up on me, instinctively dodged both of the bullets, grabbed a knife, and took it down.  Now **that** was a true rush!

22332175,english,"Well, today I bought the Gallery Episode 1 and Vanishing Realms because I heard people were raving about these games.  About 25 minutes into Gallery, I had to stop and request a refund....it feels bored to me walking around exploring looking at things solving puzzles are not my thing I guess. Maybe I don't like adventure games.  Then I play Vanishing Realms, holy shyt...this game put me in a beautiful place where I actually really feel I am walking in that world.  It reminds me of Zelda except that you're actually there and not looking at the 2d screen. The teleportation is perfect....it's easy and quick and intuitive.  I didn't like the one in Gallery's...I know there is an option to change it but i didn't bother.  Vanishing Realm's teleportation should be used as a default for EVERY VR game!! It is that good along with Budget's Cut.  I love the magic, text, words, voices of Vanishing Realm, they're engaging. When i picked up the sword, it brought a smile to my face...i am ACTUALLY holding a freaking sword!  I am now ready to beat someone up.  And when i picked up the shield....I feel more than ready for combat.  I begin to search and the first battle with the skeleton was mesmerizing...holy shyt, it's huge.  I feel overwelmed but safe because I have my sword and shield. This is no gimmick folks. Your skills in battle is based on your skills in real life lol.  It was intense and I was so into it that I even hit the wall.  I'm losing my mind. I have 15x15 space and it feels so good to get that bit of space.  I imagine people that have less space might feel frustrated because even I wish I have more space.  So those are the positives i have about the game.  I don't have negatives.

I do wish they have a saving system though,  I don't how you save the game?  You can pause the game but there is no option to save and I don't know if i lose the progress or not.  

Another thing i wish improvement is object collision.  I wish every objects in the world I hit with the sword make that collision sound.  It just feel satisfying to hit things with your sword.  If i drag the sword on the concrete, it should give me that feeling of how sword behaves in real life....with perhaps spark flying.  Anyway, these are just suggestions.

22329314,english,"This game is so much fun. Playing this with the Vive versus looking at screenshots just does not do it justice. I was enjoying it so much I was unable to stop playing this until the game told me I was done, it's that good. It's definitely my favorite Vive game I've played so far.

What I loved:
- Great sense of immersion
- Great style
- Writing (on pieces of paper throughout the game) was pretty entertaining to think about the meanings of and well written
- Little touches - things like drawing the bow string back and getting a haptic tension feeling in the controller

Things that I think could improve or at least considered by the devs:
- Combat
I didn't dislike the swordplay and shield stuff, but I felt like I was flailing a bit more than I would have liked to or felt immersive. I couldn't quite learn what was working against the enemies other than sheer flailing. I could get a cut around the head on the base skeleton warrior guys, but it was hard to replicate it time after time. Sometime I would get blocked. Using the bow and arrow was awesome and, when I was in a bind, would usually be a reliable strategy. Still I would love to be able to feel like I was a master of the swordplay.

I was also wondering what sort of assumptions were made in the way the skeleton characters block that would be advantageous or disadvantageous to either a left or right handed player. I'm not sure if it makes sense, but maybe have skeletons that are left or right handed so there's a chance to even that playing field a tad.

- User interface
It would be great if there's an option to choose a left-handed inventory ""belt"" layout. As a lefty I was picking things up frequently with my left hand, but having to reach across my body to the end slot to put an item away. I'm a pretty skinny person, but sometimes reaching and looking would cause the ""belt"" UI to shift over to the right on me, making it a bit more tedious to put the item away than it already was. It would be great as a lefty to just be able to put things away without having to stare too much at the slot.

- Multiple item ""belt"" user interface
If a slot on the belt contains more than one item, maybe experiment with implementing a mechanic where the user can twist the controller once they've activated a slot and then twisting would cycle backwards or forwards through the items in that slot. Another option might be to show the items in some sort of list that pops out once you've activated that slot and moving the controller up or down moves through the items (only a few around the current one are shown)

All of those things said, I have to say this is the highlight game for me thus far on the Vive. Great job and great start!",76561197967653872,347,7,259,0,194,1465334395,1460247168,1460247168,True,7,1,0.60357964038848877,0,True,False,True
22329179,english,"Vanishing Realms is the kind of game you dream of as a child. You get actually, physically fight monsters, the game is an absolute blast. The game isn’t without issue however.

The current implementation of teleportation is not as good as it could be. Adding an indication of where you are in your play space, similar to how The Lab handles it would be a great improvement. This wouldn’t change where you are and aren’t allowed to go; it just reduces the mental acrobats you need to go through in order to get where you want to go if you need to interact with an object. Not being able to drop objects is jarring. Yes, you need almost every item you are carrying, but sometimes I don’t want five apples on me when I’m looking for a torch or my pickaxe. The grip buttons aren’t used for anything currently, there’s your use. If the player drops a key object, maybe make the object flash, or give some other indication showing that they may need it. Overall the inventory could use some work, I don’t like having to cycle through my swords, just to get to the one I want.

Combat is extremely entertaining, but as my friend discovered, you can win your fights by “Skyward Sword-ing” your way through them. Near the end of the game, he was just waggling his sword back and forth in the enemies’ hitbox, effectively stunlocking them and turning the fights into a joke. That said, if you fight how you would expect to handle a sword and shield, the combat feels awesome. The choice of giving the play a sword first instead of a shield feels odd. From what I’ve seen, the average player doesn’t try to parry until they are told they can, and that makes the first few fights very panicked. Possibly introducing the shield first, and having the players defend against arrows before being given a weapon would introduce the combat better. I’d love to be able to shield bash my enemies, maybe not doing much (if any) damage, but being able to stagger them would be nice. The magic staff, while useful for massive damage and an AOE attack, just doesn’t feel good to use, it shoots it’s fireball in a disappointingly short arc, and doesn’t have much sensation on use.

The AI isn’t the most advanced in the world but it does try to prevent you from performing the same combinations against it. After a few similar moves, the enemies will dodge your attacks or try to block them, and forces you to try a different attack angle or method. The giant skeleton enemies downward attack also seems like it might not be working as intended, where if the player is within range to be able to hit the giant, the monster’s attack never seems to connect, since the end of the flail lands so far behind the player. All of that said, Vanishing Realms is an absolute delight to play, the environments are varied enough that you know generally where you are in the world. Although the first map is actually quite small if you are racing through it and the second is just the same arena nine times.

Since the game is in early access at the time of writing (April 9, 2016) I expect that the game will grow more over time, and the majority of its issues to get dealt with.",76561198017506998,600,6,409,0,260,1522528948,1460246417,1460246417,True,1,0,0.504073441028594971,0,True,False,True

22322883,english,"Really cool game! I had a blast playing through it. Exploring was nice, and once you achieve some of the objectives it gives a nice and satisfying feeling.

Also make sure to respect and know your chaperone bounds, especially early on in the game when you're not used to the combat yet. Only stab when you're sure you have enough room :D. I didn't have any accidents, but there were a few close calls where I nearly punched a chaperone wall.

I'd like to see some more refinement on the combat, though. It's great for a first iteration, but I feel that there's some room for improvement. Larger enemies are immersion breaking for me since you need to get close to them to whack them, but then you have non-existant collision and clipping. And their attacks also make no sense then. Also, in general, blocking works well, but attacking feels off. You don't need finesse for some enemies, just randomly flail around and you're guaranteed to get some hits in.

Oh and I love the AI sometimes. When using a bow and arrow, they eventually start dodging your arrows, and at one point they just put their guard up so it's hard to get an arrow in. A great way to deal with cheese. Speaking of archery, right now aiming is done purely with the bow hand. I'd love to see a combination of both bow hand and arrow hand, so it's more difficult to hit near the same spot over and over.

As soon as you get used to the sword and shield, you are given a bow, and it is equally fun learning to use. Firing it vertially and horizontally, you quickly learn to use it according to your playstyle.

You don't level up, you don't pick your class, break everything, pick up everything you can and keep it.  The environments are varied and well done - dwarven caves you can mine for big loot, outdoors by the ocean, into tombs and trapped passageways.  Really really well done. 

My only criticism right now is the lack of a clear save point, checkpoint or otherwise letting you know that you can stop here and still have your progress later.  I got reset a couple times, but still had a good time moving quickly through content I had seen before.

22277170,english,"Overall, this is a really cool take on the RPG genre for virtual reality.  Playing at first early access release all the way through for the first time took about 90 minutes.

I think the control schemes are superb, lacking only in inventory management. Inspiration from dungeon defenders I might go a long way for fixing inventory management.

Gameplay is somewhat diverse, but has some room for improvement in terms of diversity. 

The combat system is pretty superb, the bow doesn't feel as comfortable as the bow from the Lab, but otherwise the combat was pretty top notch.

The loot system leaves some to be desired. Even if monsters dropped items, they don't respawn, so you couldn't pick up more items that way.

The NES Zelda style shops are a good fit in terms of style, but lack the diversity of modifiers present in many other games of this genre.

22253675,english,"Excerpt from my review at UploadVR.com:

""The game is a joy to play because I’m not relying on controller muscle memory and buttons to translate my actions. The Vive removes those layers of abstraction. Which button do I press to gaze at an enemy and block that fireball? Who cares! Just look at that archer and raise your shield. Is there an arrow flying at you? Physically dodge it or duck behind that stone column for cover. Need to restore your health? Pull the potion out of your inventory and drink it.

Through these natural actions, and augmented by the haptic feedback of the Vive motion controllers, we’re projecting a tangible sense of agency into the game world in a way that was previously impossible. And the world responds accordingly.

During a particularly heated battle, I was fending off two flanking archers, a healer, and a spellcaster (make that healer a priority kill with your bow & arrow!) who were guarding the coveted Dragon Wand. I emerged sweaty and out of breath from hiding behind trees, popping out of cover, dodging arrows, and just getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment. When you start dual-wielding swords and fighting increasingly brawny boss monsters, Vanishing Realms can even turn into a legitimate workout if you get carried away.

I can easily say without reservation that Vanishing Realms is a visceral, awe-inspiring VR experience steeped in intuitive, tactile gameplay. It has left me satisfied but selfishly craving more. That it was created by a single developer in 8 months is nothing short of extraordinary, and I believe this paves the way for a surge of successful, micro-sized development teams making breakout games for virtual reality.""
