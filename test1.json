Maybe it's because I'm only a few hours into my VR journey and the novelty has not worn off yet, but this game kinda blew my mind. It's a bit simplistic... this is true... but this experience has changed the way I feel about gaming forever.  Like I said... this is one of my very first VR experiences, so perhaps if I wrote this in the future after spending a couple hundred hours in VR experiences, I'd not write so enthusiastically about this... but for now, I love this game.\n\nI'll try to be objective though to hopefully help someone make a decison about whether or not to buy this.   The setting is kinda cartoony and the enemies look a little Zelda-ish, but when engaged in a sword fight with enemies slightly larger then me, the innocence of their looks temporarily fades away and they feel a bit more menacing.  And that cartoony setting has a real sense of scale and of being a real place.   From the slight vertigo I feel looking over an edge to the floor below me, to feeling moon beams soaking into my skin... It all comes together quite nicely. \n\nThe only criticisms I have are that melee combat is a little easy and repetetive.  Block, strike, block strike... it's hard to mess up. Regardless, it's still fun.   And there are other combat options such as a ranged bow which are fun to use.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that enemies seems to just stand around and wait for you to approach.  Would be much cooler if they were a bit more aggressive and plentiful.  But then again, for a VR noob like me, maybe it would be a little too fast paced. \n\nMy biggest overall complaint is that I want more. \n\nBut, none of these things stopped me from having one of the best times in recent memory.  I can't wait to see more games of this type!  Bravo! Well done!\n\nSo, if you are new to VR like I am and the VR experience is still fresh, I think it's worth the money to try this one.

I'd love to see this game go a bit farther to give people some good feel as to what VR RPGs might start off as, but then I'd like somebody to get this guy a team and some cash flow becuase this has the right feel to it.  I felt like a kid with a tonka toy mining stuff and crawling under traps was a lot of fun.

The combat was interesting enough, and I like the fact that I got to try out some melee fighting, bow shooting, and magic via magic wand. \n\nI found the pacing to be... odd. For example, the first level often felt slow because of the exploration component. At least walking around was punctuated with combat encounters. The 2nd level had a completely different pacing. Little or no exploration, but it becomes frantic because activities are timed. I have a particular annoyance for timed things, and I eventually lost interest and stopped playing this game when I kept failing the time-based challenge.

Read on before marking as "not helpful" - it\'s not Reddit, this is a thought-out user review, not an epic troll on an internet forum.\n\nTL;DR - The game is actually somewhat polished, which automatically puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the SteamVR lineup. However, a slew of disappointing design flaws and the cheese-ability of the combat system do little to justify the pricetag when the game is as short as it is. If you\'re not too picky and willing to play along, go for it.\n\nPros & cons:\n\nPros\n-quality artstyle, decent enough ambiance to create significant immersion\n-the linear levels work without feeling railroady\n-sound effects and "game feel" work in VR, picking up coins and striking enemies doesn\'t feel like a chore\n-VR allows exploration to feel more like exploration, and less like a slog\n-A few nice and simple environmental puzzles keep the game from being a complete wagglefest.\n\nCons\n-Combat is incredibly easy to cheese. Waggling your sword at an enemy\'s head essentially guarantees victory. Add in a few quick teleports from place to place on bosses, and you\'ve got a low-effort strategy that can wreck anything without actually playing along.\n-No artificial locomotion options. Unless it was some hidden options menu I missed, there was no way of giving the player any option other than teleportation. While TP is a nice default for comfort\'s sake, there are people who would like to use it, especially in the early days of roomscale VR software.\n-It\'s short as all hell.\n-It\'s insultingly easy, even if you play along and don\'t cheese fights. The telegraphs are massive, and the shield blocks EVERYTHING with no penalties.\n-Melee enemies pretend you don\'t exist until you\'re already in striking distance. I was expecting to be ganged up on numerous times by the enemy configurations, and never was unless I explicitly tried to. Even when I was firing the bow+arrow at their friends, they never did anything but look confusedly in my direction sometimes. \n-Exploration yields little, save for a few coins. \n\nALL THIS BEING SAID, Vanishing Realms is still one of the best VR games I\'ve played.

I can´t get enough.\n\nVanishing realms: This is, without a doubt the best game I have ever played. Yes, there are some things that need to be fixed, and it is still early access. But it is truly astounding he amount of joy I get running through this wonderful Dungeon Crawler! This is the game i dreamt about as a child! Thank you Devs, you are true heroes!\n\n\nI play on warrior mode, got to sixth rite of passage where I got tangled in my cable and yanked the power cable out of my link box ^^:\n\nGood Stuff:\nSwordplay: Amazing! I will not say it cant improve, but holy hell! you guys really put in alot of work compared to any other game I have ever seen. Keep it up!\n\nAi: Sure, there are still some dumb stuff the monsters do, but the AI in this is sometimes scary good.\nBig plus for the trap devs! Got me seriously fooled!\n\nBow and arrow: Excellent. Just leave it as it is. Maby make it more real and harder still. But if not, its fine as it is!\n\nGameplay and movement: I enjoy the heck out of it! I don´t mind the teleportation too much, even though it always sucks, your teleportation is the least suckiest at the moment. The game kind of makes up for it in this case :) The story is a little bit thin, but it feels like the devs are working up to something. I can´t wait! I almost got tears in my eyes when i found the new path!\n\nThe riddles: They are wonderfully written :)\n\nBad stuff:\nI dropped both my pick-axes accidentally, and both disappeared into the floor or wall or somewhere. Could not find them again. So I had to play a very long way around before I got it all back to where I wanted to be. It´s ok though, it was fun ;) Still, if i drop something, I want to be able to pick it up.\n\nGot some bugs where I suddenly, after teleporting, was standing right in front of a monster that had not been there before. Scared the living smurfs out of me. Only happened once.\n\n\nSome words to the devs:\nDo not make it easier. Do not let people tell you they have to be able to pick through inventory faster or anything like that. Remember, this is VR, make it as you are doing now. So that we have to get physically better irl to get better in the game. Thats the beauty of vr! Don´t you think?\n\nThank you devs!

Still an incredible value.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M_-wrSKisxg\n\nVisually the game will likely feel dated to most with the low poly and cartoonish look and feel. I personally think that it fits the game and don\'t have a problem with it. Consistency is more important to me. As soon as I put the headset on I\'m immersed in that world and as long as there\'s nothing that clashes with the rest of the world or looks out of place I\'m fairly lenient. IE a 50k poly photo realistic dragon popping out of no where in a low poly cartoony game.\n\nThe gameplay is the tried and true Vanishing Realms formula. Some periods of calm with discovery, riddles and gathering interspersed with intense combat. This formula works for me and there are no complains about getting more of it.\n\nI will say, however, that everyone talking in rhymes and riddles can get a bit old having to parse what\'s being explained. The story elements probably shouldn\'t be a puzzle but that\'s fairly minor. It\'s kind like if everyone in Borderlands spoke like Zer0. I would go from a likeable trait to overkill in short order but wouldn\'t really impact the gameplay.\n\nThere are definitely some issues with the game. This is a single dev indie title. It would be very strange for there not to be issues. The ever so frustrating torch/general grip mechanics for things not weapons. Both the pick and the planks also suffered from this bug that causes the item to constantly be dropped from your hand. I\'m not sure how it was being triggered but it was definitely frustrating. Hopefully this gets patched out soon.\n\nThe UI/UX at the start of the game could also use some work. It\'s just plain confusing how you interact with it. It worked and made sense when there was just one chapter but now that we have 3 it really seems to be lacking. Even with my extra large play space, chapter 3s menu was out of my play bounds and easy to miss. There\'s a lot of room for refinement here.\n\nIn the end it comes down to the question: "Did I have fun?" As with the original game the answer is absolutely! Vanishing Realms is still a vary unique VR experience even 3-4 years after its initial launch date. Anyone who enjoys RPGs or dungeon crawls should own a copy of Vanishing Realms along with The Sundered Rift\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3UBhFSrdwpY\n\nAn amazing hack and slash that feels similar to titles like Zelda: A Link to the Past both visually and in design. When I put on the headset I feel like I was dropped into one of those dungeons and left to wander. It\'s a great feeling.\n\nThis was one of the first VR games I played and it was amazing in its first iteration. There have been two content updates since then and it\'s gotten significantly better. \n\nCombat feels better in hard mode, like you\'re actually sparring with an opponent rather than smacking a training dummy. I\'m loving the Warriors Challenge addition.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you\'re looking for something melee focused. If you\'re at all interested in a Zelda VR or Skyrim VR game, check this title out. For 19.99, you get 5-6 hours of gameplay that they\'re actively expanding on. It\'s one of the few diamonds in the EA lineup that polished and fun.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nVR Graphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAudio and Voice work 10/10\nFun Factor 12/10\n\nLocomotion: Point and teleport that has some diminishing returns/stamina algorithm that\'s hidden from the player.\n8/10 (It works very well but I\'d like to see an Onward trackpad style movement system as a toggle option in the future.

I had one crash throughout the entire game, which is better than for a lot of finished games.  \n\nI thought that the point and click movement system would bug me but it didn't and lends itself to the game very well.  The combat felt polished and was enjoyable.  It feels a bit weird to have a huge sword that doesn't weigh anything but you quickly forget thtat once you are hacking, slashing, and parrying with the monsters in the world.  \n\nThe monsters are a bit limited, there are only six or seven of them but it really doesn't matter.  The sword and shield fighting is fun and well realised and the bow and arrow action is excellent.  My only problem was not being able to hit a skeleton thing on top of a pedestal because, as it turns out, the light shade was in the way, but that's just a VR thing.  \n\nThe only crash I had was that I suddenly dropped through the floor and couldn't find any way back.  It happened once and that was it.  Everything else was completely solid.  \n\nThe game is a little more cartoonish than the advertising graphic might indicate but, again, that didn't really detract from it.  \n\nI am really, really hoping that the reason this is early access is so that further chapters can be added to it.\n\nPros:\n- Very immersive\n- Fun sword play where you have to wait for your opponent's vulnerable areas to be exposed and aim for them before you can do damage.  \n- Brilliant bow and arrow action - you have to hold the bow in one hand and draw it with the other.  The arrows fly in an arc requiring you to take that into account for long shots.\n- Very smooth gameplay\n- Very few bugs or glitches\n- Intuitive movement system\n- Very polished product - I didn't even spot any typos in the scrolls\n\nCons\n- A bit on the short side - what you see as my play time above is how long it took me to finish it but it was an enjoyable 2.9 hours.\n- Quickly switching between weapons is a bit fiddly ... actually, I'm not even sure if this is a con as it adds to the realism a bit.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game.

Melee suffers a bit from the fact that VR can't provide physical resistance. Projectile, shooting arrows and using magic wands is the really fun stuff. Dodging behind rocks and other obstacles to avoid being hit yourself can get your heart rate going and really brings you into the world.\n\nIf I were to compare it to any other VR experience I have had, the closest thing would be The Gallery, which is significantly better in the graphics and story department, but it is more puzzle oriented, with Vanishing Realms more fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game and really hope the developer continues to expand upon it.", 'timestamp_created': 1467222436, 'timestamp_updated': 1467222436, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23930915': {'recommendationid': '23930915', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198016017687', 'num_games_owned': 711, 'num_reviews': 67, 'playtime_forever': 47, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 47, 'last_played': 1466866343}, 'language': 'german', 'review': 'Nett gemachte Welt, spannende Kämpfe pe Schwert, Schild und Bogen.

The draw length of the bow is too short for me. I end up pulling my hand to 10 cm in front of my body instead of slightly behind. This should be adjustable. Also the anchor point on the controller is a bit to close to the hand so you don't get to draw the bow back correctly.\n- Magic is a bit boring. Its just a projectile weapon using Mana as ammo.\n- THIS is what changed my review to negative: With about a 2 hour playthough with good but limited gameplay options this game is good - for an early access. But the developer has said that he is about to make the game official and charge for future content. This game is not wide or deep enough to justify $20 price tag. I bought this game expecting much more bang to come from my buck.\n\nHalf way though the game I adopted a 2 handed fighting style and loved every second of mahem I rought on my enemies.\n\nSpend a whole day completing this game, enjoying the scenery and marvelling at how awesome it all is. Really looking forward to more content in the future.\n\nI think this game is a fantastic benchmark for future RPG and MMORPG games to follow. I'm thinking... this is what Elder Scrolls 6 should be. Wow that would be so unbelievably epic!\n\nHaving said all that, until the developer backtracks on his plans for future content or reduces the price, I can't recommend that people buy this.

I would recommend it to anyone first picking up the system and those that love fantasy combat.\n Below is a list of Pros and Cons for me personally. Maybe it'll be helpful to you. Overall, I loved the experience, and just nitpick a bit here.\n\n\nPros:\n-Combat feels awesome, especially when you have multiple enemies engaging you at once\n- World looks good, and the atmoshere is nice\n-Teleporting mechanic doesn't take you out of the immersion (unless you blink around like a dingus)\n- Stats and user interface are easy to understand\n- Puzzles and clues are neither too challenging, nor too simple\n- Hidden items/easter eggs are fun to look for here\n- Distinctly different weapons for various situations\n-Some enemy variety\n\nCons:\n- Switching to the bow can be difficult at times\n- The wand weapon that you get is simply too powerful. It makes clearing the final boss incredibly easy if you have maxed out your mana.\n- Enemies do not pursue the player aggressively enough\n- Combat doesn't scale up fast enough (by about 30 minutes in you should be able to kill everything with little issue, unless you are swarmed). Enemies need to attack faster.\n- Enemies are fairly similar in regards to combat behavior. Would like to see more behaviors, or something simple like some skeleton warriors having their sword+shield hands switched.\n- The final boss lost some of his wow and scare factor after figuring our this pattern.

Everything feels intuitive, you pick up an object and put it in your belt. You look at your belt and pick up what's there.

I would recommend it to anyone interested in complex (if "gamey" rather than simulationist) combat, dungeon delving, and some light puzzle solving.\n\nI completed the game in just over an hour and a half, which makes it on the shorter side for a game of this price. However, that would be comparing it to games played on a screen, vs. the experience you get here in VR. And boy does it pay off. Performing each swing and block, aiming every shot, and grabbing every lever is quite different from just pressing buttons to "use", "attack", "block", etc. The exchange of blows and blocks felt good, if a little easy (feeling generously telegraphed) by the end. I felt the pressure of being flanked in combat, and the instant fear of arrows coming from an unknown source (which you are able to quickly track down by sound, naturally). Still, I\'m itching to see more.\n\nI do like a lot of the mechanics introduced for the VR medium. If you stick your head into something, your vision blurs, or you\'re pushed back into an open space. Nice. The teleportation movement system works well enough, though I must say I quite enjoyed the more natural movement used in Spell Fighter once I got over the initial disorientation.\n\nThe only major complaint I would have is that the game seems to be designed for someone much shorter (I\'m 6\'4"/193cm and tend to tower over other Hover Junkers players). There are many low ceilings (namely in the arena) and the space feels constrained, even though I have a generous space and stayed away from the Chaperone walls. The game automatically pauses if you try to push too far outside of reach, which became an annoyance at certain points in grabbing objects or attacking some enemies, given my long reach. Default combat distance seems to be incredibly close, and enemies tend to engage me right in my face, far within the reach of my sword, not the kind of distance I like to be at while fencing! Engaging the archers in melee was also annoying as they appeared to only come up to my knees and I had to golf swing to take them out; helmets blocked any reasonable swing I would normally take. Certainly I wouldn\'t say to skip the game if you are tall, but it\'s one thing to expect, and hopefully will be changed with future development.', 'timestamp_created': 1466407663, 'timestamp_updated': 1466407663, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.502712488174438477', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23663697': {'recommendationid': '23663697', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198125924372', 'num_games_owned': 174, 'num_reviews': 8, 'playtime_forever': 149, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 99, 'last_played': 1481344779}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "THIS GAME.

Habe mich auch immer wieder dabei erwischt wie ich aus der sicheren Entfernung die Gegner beschossen hatte (Zauber/Pfeile) dooferweiße weichen die Gegner irgendwann den Pfeilen aus und Mana hat man auch nicht unbegrenzt :) Also ist man irgendwann darauf angewiesen in den Nahkampf zu gehen. Und das ist absolut beeintruckend!\n\nFazit: Das Mittendringefühl ist der Hammer, Die Kämpfe machen Spaß und das Erkunden (Looten, etc) macht sehr viel Spaß. Einziges Manko für mich war das nicht 100 prozentige Trefferfeedback bei den Gegnern (aber vertretbar:) ) und das ich bei diesen Titel leichtes motion sickness bei mir herausbeschwört, bisher aber zum Glück der einzige Titel :)\n\nAlso Absolute Kaufempfehlung! :)  \n\n\n', 'timestamp_created': 1466187858, 'timestamp_updated': 1466187858, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': False, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23616803': {'recommendationid': '23616803', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198042399728', 'num_games_owned': 165, 'num_reviews': 7, 'playtime_forever': 42, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 42, 'last_played': 1462301485}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "I thought I would really like this game, but for a couple reasons it was very disappointing to me.  \n\nThe first reason is the lack of non teleport movement.  I understand that teleporting is supposed to reduce motion sickness and discomfort at the cost of immersion, but in this game I don't think teleportation is helping.  While traversing and fighting monsters in this game you will want to  take many small teleports rapidly in sucession.  This ends up resembling a slideshow.  I find this to be very disorienting and motion sickness inducing.  A more traditional smooth movement would be much much preferable to me.\n\nMy second problem is that I was not a fan of the design and art in the game.  I expected it to feel more atmospheric and epic in scale.  Instead it felt like a retro adventure game that I somehow became trapped in.  Typical lever pulling puzzles, linear map design, and very uninspired environments.\n\nThat said, the game is quite functional and has some cool stuff to offer.

It\'s all over in about two hours, and that includes several tries at the "second chapter," which is really just kind of an arena challenge. In a traditional game, I\'d consider this more like a "vertical slice" than a finished game, because it introduces a bunch of zelda-like tools (sword, shield, bow, pickaxe, hammer, etc.) but you don\'t get much use out of any of them. There are only seven kinds of enemies, one of them a boss and the other a miniboss. So it\'s short.\n\nBut for VR right now, this isn\'t a huge downside; there hasn\'t really been time to create long games, and the tech is so new that experiences like this feel a bit like a theme park ride. And if this [i]were[/i] a theme park ride, I\'d be pretty tempted to pay another $20 to go and do it again. The graphical style and animations are quite polished, and the atmosphere is very well done. And it\'s hard to overstate how intimidating the giant skeletons in the game are when you first encounter them. By the end of the game, you\'ll have found exploits for their combat AI, which is pretty limited, but that\'s fine, because that\'s how RPGs always are--by the end, you\'re a seasoned warrior who has no trouble dispatching hordes of low-level enemies and even a boss or two. It\'s just that here, you\'re actually more skilled at defeating the enemies.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that my play area is slightly below the minimum requirements: mine is 1.8x2.5m. I was still able to play the game fine, although I did encounter the auto-pause feature a lot. The game pauses if you get too close to the edge of your play area while doing something active, so that you won\'t swing through your chaperone and break something. At that point it asks you to move back to the center of your play space (which is shown with a green circle and some arrows) and hit a button to unpause. This works pretty well, though it does break up the flow of the action a little.

Ignore the "early access" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.\n\nWhat makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: Wield your controller as a sword! Parry attacks! Lunge! Chop! Once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! Use a bow and arrow (like in The Lab)! Switch between them! Yay!\n\nSome "early access" things do come up. They are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: Combat is too easy once you understand it. The enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don\'t know how to move around intelligently. I think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other VR games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. Finally, 2 hours is not enough! By the time I got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! It would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.\n\nBut these seem like nitpicks.

Hell, it'll be my first review anywhere. \n\nThere's not much I can say that hasn't been, but I'll try anyway since I think devs need to see that their efforts are worthwhile and makeing a huge difference.\n\nI remember playing Legend of Zelda on NES as a kid.  I loved it so much I asked to go to the hardware store, bought a plank of wood, and went at trying to create my own shield. Epic fail, since my artistic and handicraft skills are subpar - at best. But it was the first spark of a decades long, insatiable quest to transport myself to another world and do the things that weren't possible. \n\nIt's been a long time since then, but for the first time ever, I feel like I've come close. This game is the promising first step in that journey. For those of us who have gotten Vive or are contemplating getting it, it's going to be a rough ride until something with Skyrim/Zelda production value comes out. But if you've even the slightest inclination to really feel like you're the hero in the game, this is the closest you can get at this time.\n\nPRO's: \n- Everything you could extrapolate from my introductory statements. You *are* the hero in this game. It's f-in' great. \n- Excellent swordplay mechanics (some prefer Spell Fighter VR - which is great - but I think the dodge/block/parry mechanics are better here). \n- Engaging atmosphere despite the sourced assets (ie: the character models were bought from a store).\n- Solid music. \n- Intuitive puzzles.\n- Leaves you aching for more content. \n\nCONS:\n- An argument can be made that it is a short experience. However, none of us early adopters should go into *any* game thinking we're going to experience the next Skyrim/Dishonored/etc...\n- While I think the utility belt inventory system is very interesting, I have to hyperextend my head downwards to see it. It also moves around erratically when I'm kneeling down. \n- I'd love it if there was more depth to the magic system (currently it's item-based magic limited to one item at this time). Not hoping for a miracle here, but it would've been nice to play as a wizard rather than a sword fighter every time. \n- No Hard Mode. While enemy difficulty does increase slightly, they are far outpaced in damage after gaining the last sword. They also become easier in general by the time you have a second playthrough. Hard Mode needs to happen. \n- Trackpad locomotion for both movement and turning would be superior for those of us with 'vr legs'. I like teleporting sometimes, but in battle I'd rather just reorient myself with the trackpad. It feels like cheating to just teleport away.\n\nAnyway, I hope this inspires other devs to keep the ball rolling and iterate on RPG/Adventure games. And to the dev of this game in particular, please keep up the good work. There's not many who've gambled on anything resembling an RPG at this stage in the VR launch cycle, and you're currently leading the pack by a wide margin.

The last part of the game (spoiler alert) is just repeated arena fights, perhaps added to pad out the length of the game so people will be less likely to get refunds.\n- Dull movement, besides room scale you can only teleport, and because it does not show you where your playspace will be in your prospective destination (like The Lab does), it makes movement frustrating.\n- Poor AI, understandable for an early VR game, but the enemies keep backing away, which means I have to keep teleporting close to them because my play space is only 2.5x2.5 meters, but the game sometimes prevents you from teleporting directly next to an enemy.  All in all it feels like enemy movement is working against the melee mechanics.\n- Bow is not fun.  It aims wherever your primary hand is pointing it, secondary hand is just used to pull back the arrow, making it feel unrealistic.\n- Lack of story, there are just a few cryptic messages guiding you around.  The game has little atmosphere and almost no personality.\n- Bad UI, you have to look down to check yout health, mana, gold, and inventory.  This combined with the small sweet spot on the Vive\'s lenses, makes it difficult to focus on the text.  Maybe it is better for people without glasses, I don\'t know.\n- Abandonware?  The game has passed the time frame layed out in the early access description, with no updates in two months.  The game was described as having almost two hours of content per chapter, but I was able to easily clear both chapters in under two hours, as the second chapter is just a series of arena fights.\n\nI really wanted to like this game based on it\'s reviews, but I found the gameplay to not be very fun, and it was only challenging when it was frustrating, such as fights against groups of enemies when you can\'t tell who is hitting you from where.

Maybe I am spoiled by games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, where after 120 hours of gameplay, I am not even close to done playing? And I picked that up for $30. Here, I am paying $20 for two hours of entertainment, so it doesn\'t quite add up no matter how good it is.\n\nWith that aside, what you do get to experience in those 2 hours is quite good. It is definitely cool to fight the skeletons, especially when dual wielding two swords, even though the fights are a little slow and clunky with so-so collision detection. I can see this maybe becoming a little more worth the price if a few bonus or side quests are added, along with a separately selected arena with leader boards. In a game that already has a bow and arrow, swords, a shield, and a magic wand, the possibilities for mini-games are endless.\n\nAdd that extra content, and I would fully recommend this game as a worthwhile $20 investment, but as it is now, I feel a bit slighted, and would not have paid more than $8-$10. It is also interesting to note that since the game takes just over 2 hours to complete, it takes you just past the 2 hour game time limit for returns, and then ends - that seems like a little more than a coincidence to me, but it is mentioned in the description, so it\'s not like it\'s a shock when it ends and you are left upset that there isn\'t more. But that right there is the important part - I was left wanting more. \n\nI didn\'t give this game a thumbs down because it is a bad game, I gave it a thumbs down because it is currently rather over-priced. I hope that will change as development continues, and if it does, I will try to remember to update my review/recommendation.\n\nUPDATE: Rather disappointed that after 4 months, there is still not a single update to this game. I stand by my review that this had the potential to be one of the greatest VR experiences out there, but instead the developer seems to have taken our money and disappeared.

Every game should work like this.\n\nThe bad:\n(I like to complain so this is much larger than the "Good" section, but shouldn\'t be considered to outweigh the good)\n*Gameplay isn\'t balanced. There isn\'t enough variety between the weapons - the two bows both do 5 damage, the medium sword and the hammer both do 6 damage, the hammer doesn\'t work any differently than the sword. Enemies have an aggro range of about 3 feet and you can skip entire battles by standing out of aggro range and blasting away with your ranged weapons. When you\'re actually in melee range, the enemies crowd you too much; one of those skeleton soldiers fills up your entire screen and makes you constantly want to back up.\n*Combat is too simple when you\'re fighting only one enemy but completely overwhelming and unmanageable when you\'re fighting 3 enemies, partially because the enemies are so bulky you can only watch one at a time\n*Not enough enemy attack animations. The skeleton soldier is the main enemy you encounter and only has two or three animations. After you get used to the timing of its main attack, you get a brief period of feeling badass and then combat starts to go stale.\n*There are no consequences for death. You respawn 10 feet away with your inventory intact and the enemies still wounded. This is probably because the gameplay isn\'t balanced.\n*Store assets - the same skeleton soldier also appears in Legend of Luca, which must mean it was bought from the Unity asset store or a third-party asset store. Not inherently bad, but gamers can grow sick of models if they start popping up in multiple games\n*Inventory system is buggy, clunky, and impossible to use in combat. Once a fight starts, the only way you can switch weapons is to teleport far away from the fight, which feels like cheating\n*Only 2 - 3 hours of gameplay depending on how much you rush and how much you get lost\n*Save system is minimalistic - it saves your inventory and your position but not your progress. Enemies and obstacles respawn if you quit the game and load up your save again\n*No way to return to the menu without quitting the game. C\'mon, this isn\'t the NES era...\n*The developer isn\'t active on the forum, which is bad form for an EA game.

Und ich muss sagen, es hat mich wirklich sehr unterhalten! \n\nGameplay:\nVanishing Realms funktionert einwandfrei in VR. Die Bewegungen werden fast immer perfekt ins Spiel übertragen und es ist einfach beeindruckend, wie man mit Schild und Schwert gegen virtuelle gegner antreten kann. Hierbei ist allerdings zu beachten, dass man ausreichend Platz im Zimmer hat. Meine Spielfläche ist ca. 2 x 1,5 meter groß und es kam mehr als einmal vor, dass ich den Controller gegen die Wand geschmettert habe. Neben Schwert und Schild gibt es unter anderem noch zwei Bogen, die für abwechslung sorgen.\nSehr positiv zu bewerten sind auch Dinge wie das abbauen von Erzen wie Gold und Diamand, sowie die Suche nach anderen "Schätzen". Es gibt auch ein kleines Gesundheitssystem, wobei man Tränke, Äpfel oder Orangen essen kann um sich zu erholen.\n\nStory:\nHier gibt es eher wenig zu berichten. Eine wirkliche Geschichte wird einem nicht erzählt. Es gibt lediglich ein paar "Schriftrollen" zu studieren die zumeist Hinweise zum lösen eines Rätsels sind. \nDas Spiel baut eher auf dem Erkunderdrang und der VR Erfahrung, als auf einer Geschichte auf.\n\nGrafik:\nDie Grafik von Vanishing Realms ist natürlich weit entfernt von neuesten nicht VR Titeln, jedoch mit der Vive definitiv schön anzusehen. Es ist nicht nur einmal passiert, dass ich mir eine kurze auszeit vom Spielen nahm, um mir die Umgebung genauer anzusehen und der typische "VR wow Effekt" war selbst in einem Grafisch eher schlichten Titel wie diesem da. Alles ist sehr übersichtlich gestaltet, was der geringen Auflösung des VR headsets zu gute kommt. \nAls ich das erste mal vor einem der Skelett Gegner stand, hatte ich doch schon ziemlich schiss. Ich weiss das sich das lustig anhört, aber wer selbst mal die Erfahrung macht wird sehen was ich meine ;)\n\nFazit:\nVanishing Realms hat mich ohne Zweifel sehr gut Unterhalten und gezeigt, was zukünftige VR Spiele alles nutzen, bzw. besser machen können. Das einzige was mich zum Schluss dann doch gestört hat, war die Länge des Spiels. Ich hatte das Spiel in etwas mehr als 2 Stunden durchgespielt. Für 20€ hätte ich da schon etwas mehr erwartet.

This is exactly the type of thing I was hoping for when it was announced a few years ago that VR was coming to the mass market. It isn\'t perfect, but it does a number of things very well.\n\nFirst, the cons. \n\nWhat I didn\'t see in the description of the game is that it "highly recommends" a 2.0 x 2.0 meter space. I live in a small apartment, and my play space is only 2.0x1.6 meter. I can still play the game, but I have to be very careful because any time I stick my sword arm through the "wall" (my restricted space is couches, so I can reach well above them, I just can\'t walk into them) the game pauses, forces me to re-center in the space, and then unpause. Slightly annoying, but better than constantly walking into things. \n\nHowever, within about 30 minutes I learned how to not over-extend, but as a 6\'0" guy who has done steel sabre fencing and sword & board fighting in the SCA, it was hard to not try to execute lunges and molinets (wrist turns to get around an opponent\'s shield and hit them in the face) in that "forbidden zone". Treating it more like a video game and less like a fighting simulation did the trick.\n\nThe story is a little on the flimsy side. Don\'t expect anything too deep, you pretty much can get the gist of it from watching the intro video on the Steam page. It\'s not horrible or bad, it\'s just basic fantasy tropes.\n\nThe pros: \n\nThe graphics are beautiful. To me, titles like this prove that we don\'t need photo-realism to be immersive in VR, especially when the game runs smoothly. \n\nFighting monsters that are taller than I am is a lot of fun. I\'ve always been a fan of games where projectiles persist in the environment, and fighting with an arrow sticking out of your shoulder is surprisingly satisfying. I mentioned the sword and shield mechanic struggles I had above, but it\'s still a lot of fun to use that weapon combo. The bow and arrow mechanics work fantastically and are a lot of fun, and you can\'t beat the destructive power of the magic wand.\n\nObjects are easy to interact with and add a lot to the feel. The inventory system is pretty top-notch and intuitive: in need of a little health? Grab that apple out of the pocket you stuck it in and "eat" it by holding it up to your mouth. Did you find a key? Go find the lock that it goes to. \n\nMost of the text is super easy to read. Sometimes I struggle to see the health/mana meters because you have to look at your feet to see them, but the fact that they\'re out of the way when you\'re fighting is nice, and you can usually tell by the amount of blood you\'re looking through how your health is doing. :)\n\nOverall, highly recommended. Don\'t let the minor flaws get in the way of a good time.

After I played the two available chapters in Vanishing Realms, it became my favorite VR experience so far. The scale of the first chapter is great and going around the cave and then the open world was great. \n\nWhat I really liked about Vanishing Realms was the combat and the way in which the inventory/UI is handled. The combat is crazy satisfying as you go against enemies looking for their attacks to block/parry but then you're also looking for their opennings that you can then strike. Every fight and every kill I got felt satisfying and deserved. \n\nAs for the UI and inventory system, it is really simple and gets the job done. The UI is mostly minamalistic in that when you are looking out normally, you see no UI blocking your view. Everything UI is down below at your waist. When of your stats change (health, mana, or gold) they do pop up into your view but slowly lower back down to your waist. This system is perfect. Then for the gear and weapons you have, there's two 'backpacks', on on the left and right. This allows you to put things like keys, torches, food, potions, etc... in the backpack of the hand you will likely use. Torches and keys I would use in the left, but food and potions which I would need fast in combat were placed in my right pack so that my dominant hand could easily and quickly get to them. Between to two packs are your weapons devided into categories of one-handed melee, ranged-bow, and ranged-wand, and also the shield spot. Getting into fights and having to alternate between the weapons and gear was really simple and I never struggled to fight the way I wanted to in any engagement.\n\nIf you own a Vive, you need to play this first-person, Zelda style game.\n\n5/5", 'timestamp_created': 1464044446, 'timestamp_updated': 1464044446, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.472061634063720703', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23163202': {'recommendationid': '23163202', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197974513624', 'num_games_owned': 164, 'num_reviews': 9, 'playtime_forever': 158, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 153, 'last_played': 1469893758}, 'language': 'french', 'review': "Un peu cher pour son contenu actuel, mais ça reste l'un des jeux les plus immersif en VR d moment.\nLe jeux ne brille pas forcément par sa réalisation technique, des bugs sont là et certaines mécaniques mériteraient à être peaufinée (mais n'oublions pas qu'il s'agit d'un jeu en accès anticipé et donc en cours de développement), mais clairement, par moment, on à vraiment l'impression d'être dans ce chateau perdu sur une ile.\nUn grand espace est néanmoins requis pour ne pas heurté trop trouvent les bords de l'air de jeux, ce qui casse l'immersion (je conseillerais 2,5m x 2,5m minimum).\n\nImpatient que la suite sorte, et que l'ergonomie soit amérliorée", 'timestamp_created': 1464043531, 'timestamp_updated': 1464043531, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23158298': {'recommendationid': '23158298', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197968546236', 'num_games_owned': 764, 'num_reviews': 1, 'playtime_forever': 1189, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 162, 'last_played': 1496518048}, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'Great "mini" RPG with Zelda elements with some fun exploration thrown in.

However, since VR is new and has limited users its completely understandable why games such as this, which have a cost associated with them only last two to three hours. The developers have to price their games in a way that will bring them a return when sales will be lower than the general PC market. Got it.\n\nThat said, the couple of hourse of gameplay that are available with Vanishing Realms are a heck of a lot of fun. I often felt like I was playing the role Indiana Jones and the environments are absoluetly stunning in VR.\n\nHowever, it is the room scale that really pushes the bar high. Being able to stroll around your own little space, lighting torches, peering over edges and looking through windows provides a gaming experience that I have simply never come close to having before. That isn't to say it is the best gaming I have ever had, it isn't; but it is so radically different to everything I have done before that comparing Vanishing Realms to any stadard monitor driven game would be like comparing apples and oranges. \n\nSo, Vanishing Realms is short but awesomely entertaining.\n\nThe combat is also very done. I generally don't emjoy first person combat games. Call of Duty? No thanks, not for me. However, even though this is technically a first person RPG, I wouldn't have it any other way. If this is a taste of things to come, then I can safely say that the first person gaming was simply made for VR... it just started out a few years before the tech :) Having a skeleton stand right in front of you hammering his rusty blade in your face can be genuinely intimidating. However, being able to lift your own sword (not a mouse/keyboard but an actual physical object in your hand that is perfectly tracked) in order to parry those attacks and then being able to thrust it into it's head to deplete its health is incredibly satisfying.\n\nSadly, there is a slight negative because things turn a little bit less satisfying once you have equipped the bow and arrow. You see, the AI is not particularly good, and as long as you stay at a distance you can spam your arrows to kill the enemies and they won't even move towards you. They can strafe a little from time to time but as soon as I had the bow all the danger became almost completely inert and that was a real shame. In the end I just put the bow away and only used it when absolutely necessary, ie if enemies could not be reached via melee, but it seems like a silly thing to have to do to get the most enjoyment out of the game.\n\nThat said, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms to anybody who has a Vive. Feel free to watch my video (linked at the start of my review) for a general idea of what the game is about, but this won't even begin to give you a taster of the actual experience. The game is great, so I thank the developer for their efforts and I can't wait to see what will be coming next!\n\nFuzz", 'timestamp_created': 1463866822, 'timestamp_updated': 1463866855, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 2, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.523809552192687988', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23125232': {'recommendationid': '23125232', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198038864953', 'num_games_owned': 544, 'num_reviews': 15, 'playtime_forever': 153, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 75, 'last_played': 1585347664}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "One of the best, if not the best VR games I've ever played (including Oculus titles).

Ever.\n\nLet me start by saying, this is an early access game, which should make what I will say all the more impactful. Also, to set the context, I am in my mid 40\'s and remember playing Pong, getting an Atari 2600 in 1977 (coinciding with Star Wars, what a great year), owning Intellivision 1 and 2, Colecovision, NES, IBM PC jr, Commodore 64, XBOXes, PS\'s, you name it. I like games. I am an avid board gamer, I have designed games and was my groups Dungeon Master in D&D going back to 1980. In terms of VR, I backed DK1, bought a DK2, and own an Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive. I\'ve played every TES game, All of the Ultimas (started with Ultima 2 when it came out.)\n\nThis is some next nevel shit....and by that I mean thanks to VR.  skipping some levels that should have somehow been in there in between. All credit to Palmer Lucky and other innovaters for what we are now able to experience. \n\nNow, some things to get out of the way about this game right now. Be warned, that unless you are someone who enjoys early access to games, this is not for you. I feel this warning should be READ before people buy these titles. It\'s right there in blue, but people seem to ignore it.\n\nThe game is too short at this time. The game does not have realistic monsters, or AAA title graphics. You MUST make sure to set up your Vive perfectly to get the most out of this, and by that I mean make sure your play area is well defined with a good amount of room. Mine is 2m x 2m and my gut tells me that is minimum to REALLY enjoy this game once you start swinging around your weapon. Make sure your hardware supports smooth frame rates with the Vive.\n\nOnce all of the finicky parts are set, you can launch into the game. I will say this again, but I don\'t like the look of the monsters- but I believe most younger gamers will prefer it. I like more "serious" looking monsters, just a preference. While you are walking around in the world and interacting with it, this won\'t matter at all. In the heat of combat, I found it almost startling how something that looks pretty standard on the monitor, can be intimidating once you are fitted into it\'s scaled den. I love the inventory system, where you only need to look down at your belt and pouches and grab what you need. Eat food to improve health, grab a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, or a staff, or a bow. The immersion factor is top notch. The weapons feel great. Ducking and side stepping ranged attacks feels phenomenal.\n\nI will give you one example in the game to show you why this is the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.\n\nDeep in the heart of a battle with 3 orcs and 2 floating magic users hurling magic fireballs at me, I hurried to a cluster of rocks. I crouched behind the rocks and watched as fireballs just missed me and singed the side of the rocks I was leaning against. I decided to try to pick off the high floating magic users first. I noted that each time I would attack the orcs, these damned MU\'s would heal them. I grabbed my trusty bow. I waited until a blast hurled past me. I leaned out just enough to see the enemies and focused on the one closest to me. I slowly drew back my arrow, and tried to aim just above the MU, keeping steady. I released the arrow and made a hit. I continued to pound him and when I got him low in HP, he began to heal himself. I knew I had to increase the rate of my hits. I found a better spot to attack him. A barrage of hits met their mark, and I took the first MU down. I used this tactic to take out the other MU, and had to sidestep his balls of fire while making my way to a tree that was good cover, but closer in range to him. Once I dispatched him, I put away my bow and healed up a bit as quickly as I could. I then drew my sword in my right hand, and my shield in the left. I rushed the orcs, and in a fit of slashes I dealt damage to them. I would use the shield to try to block attacks from one, while stabbing and slashing the others. I finally killed them all and took their treasure.

However, I really don\'t care that much that it should detract from my rating.

That being said I was playing just under the 2m X 2m space but I was able to make due just fine, I just wish I had a bit more space.\n\nIf you are running room scale VR and always wanted to battle the undead with swords and shields or a bow and arrow then buy this game, seriously, do not hesitate. It may be a bit cartoony but it gets the job done. This is a dungeon crawl that seriously made me glad I bought the Vive over the competition.\n\nWhy are you still reading this? Adventures await! This game is worth it at double the price!\n\nEdit - \n\nI have now used the Oculus Rift and room scale with this game as well as the HTC Vive. I would like to comment on how the game handles with the Rift. The Rift plays quite well with 3 sensor room scale. I did not have any issues at all. I was able to set up the Rift sensors to get good tracking even when on the ground, at times I felt I had better control on the ground with the Rift vs Vive. At no time did I feel any disconnect in the hour I played. I was quite pleased! I then attempted to use the game with only 2 sensors. I would highly not recommend this. This game requires full 360 tracking and 2 sensors will not give you 100%, I was able to get it to a playable level but I did run into disconnect issues with the controllers and it breaks the flow of the game.\n\nIf you have 3 sensor room scale for the Oculus Rift this game is a must have!!!!!", 'timestamp_created': 1463635583, 'timestamp_updated': 1506828761, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '23075789': {'recommendationid': '23075789', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198010301463', 'num_games_owned': 242, 'num_reviews': 2, 'playtime_forever': 491, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 354, 'last_played': 1463947466}, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'This game is really (really really) fun.

The map accuracy for the bows and arrows were surprisingly accurate, allowing for hiding behind cover, aiming without looking (stretch the arms around the corner), dodging incoming arrows, and, for the slow, looking down at the arrows sticking out of you!

I really hope we see more games like this in the future! \n\nPros:\n-I am a big fan of the item belt and really didn\'t have any issues with inventory management. I used the simple tactic of putting useful items like the pick and torch in my left pouch and put food and potions in the right pouch and it works like a charm.\n-Love the feel and atmosphere of the game world, I spent a few minutes in each area just looking around. You really feel like you are in a dank dungeon or mine. \n-Combat is fun and a little channenging at times (especially against two or more foes). The hit detection could use a little work, but I imagine that its hard to get a virtual sword with 1:1 motion controls to work and feel right. After all the sword and the skelleton you are swinging at are not really there. Over all I was impressed with how fun the combat is. \n-The puzzles, while not hard, required some thought.\n-Felt very much immersed in the game. This is one of those games you say "Oh, Ill boot that up and play for 15 min." and then end up pulling the headset off an hour later saying "Wow! that was fun!"\n-Felt like I was getting just a taster of what games will be like in a few years time. After my first hour in the game, I put it down and though "I really hope we see a major AAA game in this style." \n- Enemies feel intimidating and do protect themsevles well. They attempt to block or dodge arrows, and will cover up or step back if they are taking a beating. Also, watching my wife dancing across the room in an all out  fencing duel with thin air is always fun.\n- Mini bosses and bosses were very fun and, I think, a great addition to the game. There are 6 types of enemies and each feel different and have different fighting styles/tactics. I found that killing them in the order of [spoiler] Healer -> Ranged -> melee [/spoiler] helped a lot, and was required in some fights. \n\nCons:\n- While satisfied with the game at the $20 asking price, I want more! I had a lot of fun playing this, and cant wait for the devs to make a sequel or similar. (beat the game in about 2 hours) \n- Sometimes when looking down at the inventory belt the HMD will slide up your face a tiny bit and make what you are trying to see blur. Not a huge problem and may not be an issue for people who can get their Vive securely glued to thier face. But with my giant head, I found myself reaching up and holding the Vive in place so I could see a few times.\n- Because you are swinging the controllers around and moving quite a bit to dodge fireballs and arrows the game tries to keep you in the center of the play area so you dont hit something. This causes the game to pause with a screen that tells you to return to the center of the room and press pause to resume.

Perhaps making arrows a limited resource would help. E.g. you could loot some arrows from the arrow-filled skeletons you find, and the bowmen you kill.

Jetzt möchte ich es auffrischen:\n\nVanishing Realms ist sicherlich ein sehr gutes VR RPG (wobei die allgemeine Liste der VR RPGs recht klein ist) aber dennoch hat dass Spiel auch ein paar Macken, später mehr dazu.\n\nIch brauchte knapp 2.5 Stunden um das gesamte Spiel durch zu spielen (dabei habe ich sehr langsam gespielt und mir jede Ecke des Games genauer angeschaut). Das SPIEL (keine Erfahrung!) ist im allgemeinen das Geld wert aber nachdem die Storykomponente einmal beendet wurde gibt es keinen Wiederspielwert denn alle Items wurden bereits erbeutet und ich logge mich nicht nochmal ein nur weil ich einen Erfolg haben möchte, den ich bekomme wenn ich 50 Kerzen angezündet habe.\n\n\n\n[H1]Negativ[/H1]\n\n- Kein Wiederspieltwert! Du wirst das Spiel vermutlich nicht nochmal starten nachdem du die Story abgeschlossen hast. Es wäre sehr schön gewesen wenn sich der Developer ein System hätte einfallen lassen, dass den Spieler auch nach Beendigung der Story weiterhin beschäftigt.\n\n- Es gibt lediglich eine einzige Möglichkeit sich Fortzubewegen (Teleport). Gerade in Kampfsituation hätte ich mir gewünscht nicht erst nach einem Platz zum teleportieren suchen zu müssen.\n\n- Das ständige Bücken (wenn man so wie ich jedes Goldstück aufheben will) ist wirklich nicht sehr freundlich. Der Loot sollte immer in Spielerhöhe leicht zu greifen sein.\n\n- Das Userinterface ist so lala, es funktioniert zwar, wird aber zum Ende des Spieles unglaublich unübersichtlich und überfüllt sich. So greift man schließlich anstatt zum Schwert dann doch zum Bogen oder Zauberstab.\n\n- Monster droppen nur Gold/Mana. Ich hätte mir sehr gewünscht das Monster (gerade die Stärkeren) auch Ausrüstung droppen (so wäre eine wirklich Klassische RPG Komponente abgedeckt).\n\n- Kein Aufleveln.\n\n- Die Story wird nur auf Englisch (kein leicht verständliches Englisch) und über In-Game Texte erzählt.\n\n- Gelegentliche Bildfehler beim Teleportieren (vor allem wenn man sich draußen Aufhält).\n\n- Relativ niedrig aufgelöste Texturen (Der Stil ist trotzdem stimmig aber es könnte deutlich besser sein). Ich vermute das an sehr vielen Stellen Assets gekauft und benutzt wurden (völlig i.O und verständlich).\n\n\n\n[H1]Positiv[/H1]\n\n- Die Story lässt sich ganz gut spielen aber geht definitiv unter wegen dem herausragendem Kampfsystem\n\n- Die allgemeine Stimmung im Spiel wird sehr gut umgesetzt. Man hat immer das Gefühl von einer "höheren Macht" beobachtet zu werden.\n\n- Stimmige Soundeffekte mit Hall etc.\n\n- Man kann mit sehr vielen Objekten interagieren, so lassen sich zum Beispiel Fässer zerstören und Heuhaufen und Banner in Brand setzen.\n\n- Überall sind kleine Pokale versteckt die man sich erbeuten kann. Im Grunde wird man für alles was man in Brand setzt oder zerstört belohnt.\n\n\n\n[H1]Fazit[/H1]\n\nIch empfehle jedem Spieler der sich für RPGs interessiert Vanishing Realms auszuprobieren. Das Geld ist das Spiel defintiv wert und vor kurzem gab der Developer bekannt, dass er nun an der dritten Erweiterung arbeitet. Wer dauerhaften Spaß sucht sollte erst noch abwarten um zu sehen ob der Entwickler daran arbeitet einen Wiederspielwert in das Spiel einzubauen.\n\nAlles in allem gibt es von mir eine Kaufempfehlung und eine Bewertung mit 7/10 Sternen.\n\n\nFür die, die Vanishing Realms schon durch gespielt haben und jetzt auf neuen Content warte, hier meine Spieletipp: Trickster VR (ähnlich zu Vanishing Realms aber mehr Fokus auf Kampf und Waffen).\n\n\nViel Spaß', 'timestamp_created': 1463305963, 'timestamp_updated': 1492208593, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22987086': {'recommendationid': '22987086', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197990944641', 'num_games_owned': 587, 'num_reviews': 14, 'playtime_forever': 944, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 696, 'last_played': 1514537834}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "Absolutely amazing game.

I decided to take the plunge, as much for lack of other content as anything.\n\nThis has been the single best experience I\'ve ever had in gaming - by a wide margin. Not just VR, everything.\n\nTips to super-enjoying this:\n\n1. Let yourself be immersed. Try and BE the character you\'re playing. I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there.\n2. Move around frequently in your play-space. Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often. So just make sure you shift around a lot. Be free.\n3. If you do 1. right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they\'re going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit. It\'ll put the hairs up on the back of your neck.\n\nLegit criticisms:\n\n1. AI is pretty crap in this. Enemies aren\'t smart and just sit there staring at you even though you\'re only 2 meters away.\n2. AI fights incredibly slowly. This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing.\n3. AI doesn\'t really adapt to your fight style - I\'m sure this will be fixed in other games given time. But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land.\n4. Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn\'t matter too much since you get lost in the moment.\n5. MOAR CONTENT! Left me desperate for more.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is the single best entertainment experience I\'ve ever had. This game is amazing.

The puzzle are very well thought.\n\nBottom line : this game is an early access, but I think this is because the story is not completed yet, not because of the game features (which are stables and well made).\n', 'timestamp_created': 1462985354, 'timestamp_updated': 1462985354, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.523809552192687988', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22913611': {'recommendationid': '22913611', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197971732951', 'num_games_owned': 637, 'num_reviews': 5, 'playtime_forever': 284, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 263, 'last_played': 1474695350}, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'This is the first ever review I have written for a game on Steam.  I was motivated to write it because, out of all the VR games I own, this has been the most fun and awe-inspiring experience on the HTC Vive to date.  It\'s basically a Zelda-like game where you are actually inside the dungeon.  I own many other VR games and in my opinion this is way better than Job Simulator and the Lab, which feel more like VR tech demos.  Vanishing Realms is a very short game.  I was able to complete the available content in a little less than 3 hours or so.  It does have a lot of interesting mechanics and once you get used to the movement and combat, it is one of those games that make you salivate about what the future of VR has in store.  I am not going to describe the game itself, as you can get that from the Store page.  I will describe the experience though.  \n\nThe initial chapter of the game sees your character locked inside a dungeon that you must try to escape by finding keys, following hints in riddles or defeating various types of enemies.  It is very immersive, and you really feel as if you are inside this world, to the point that I often found myself swinging my "sword" outside the playable area and bashing my furniture (make sure you have enough room to play as the game suggests a larger playing area than most other games).  Fighting multiple enemies is fun and sometimes challenging, as enemies will change their attack patterns after a bit and dodge your arrows and magic attacks.  The weapons right now are limited to three different swords and a hammer for melee, two different bows and a fire magic wand for ranged attacks.  Enemies vary based on their abilities and you will find yourself fighting skeleton warriors, archers, mages (as well as healers) and a few bigger baddies and bosses.  Once you complete the initial dungeon, you are teleported to an arena-style area where you have to defeat all the enemies within a time limit in order to complete the game.  The game has various checkpoints whereby you can save your progress by walking over them.\n\nI own several other VR games such as Holopoint, VR Minilands Golf, Job Sim, the Lab, The Blue, etc (just check my game list).  Vanishing Realms doesn\'t have a high replayability index, but is a way better experience for the price than many other VR games available now.  The only downsides to this game are its brevity, the lack of guidance at certain points (although it\'s not that hard to figure out) and the semi-ambiguous ending, although it does seem like the developer is working on more content.  I have to say that at this point, this is the only VR game I own that I have been motivated to play all the way through.\n\nAgain, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who owns the Vive and wants to get a good idea of what VR can potentially offer in a gaming experience.  I really felt like I was inside this world and I would be completely immersed in the fights and the game mechanics.  Some things could still use a bit of polish but I definitely think this is an experiencee worth checking out if you are into VR.', 'timestamp_created': 1462984619, 'timestamp_updated': 1462984619, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22905996': {'recommendationid': '22905996', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197970817516', 'num_games_owned': 565, 'num_reviews': 23, 'playtime_forever': 140, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 140, 'last_played': 1462938729}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "It's rudimentary gameplay and simple storyline attest to the infancy of consumer virtual reality, but don't let that fool you.

Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times. I play in a 8ft by 10.5ft play area. Many of the other games I've played will utilize the location of the monitor/computer in the room and set the default facing direction as away from the monitor.\n\nThe game takes about 2 hours to finish. That said I wouldn't consider the game worth its current price with its currently limited amount of content. To justify the price I believe the final product (after early access ends) should have have at least two or three times as much gameplay as what we can currently enjoy in the first two chapters. I mean paying $10 per hour for first play-through content is a little rediculous. \n\nI also felt that some of the game's design elements were created to keep the early access beyond Steam's 2 hour refund period. For example time-consuming use of a mining-pick to obtain gold (which is neccessary to proceed), as well as the cryptic hints on how to proceed to the end of each chapter or how to pass through certain doorways.", 'timestamp_created': 1462758067, 'timestamp_updated': 1462761805, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22872096': {'recommendationid': '22872096', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198014624187', 'num_games_owned': 171, 'num_reviews': 7, 'playtime_forever': 502, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 485, 'last_played': 1463012795}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "This is it.

There hasn't been a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or disoriented in the time I have played.\n\nThe combat is a little slow paced but I suppose it is for the better after trying other games that had fast paced combat which can make you feel uncomfortable and outright dangerous if designed wrong especially when fights get so intense that you forget about your chaperone bounds.\n\nThe cable you are tethered to also hampers your movement so I can't move quickly comfortably because I am always worried about tripping over the wire or smacking into a wall despite the chaperone warning which is often neglected in really heated moments. So I find it good that this game took a slower paced approach.\n\nBut the combat was far from snail paced, It was quite entertaining dueling with archers and sword skeletons, trading steel and arrows, dodging and blocking, and taking cover.\n\nThe AI though not the smartest in the world somehow seemed to react to my actions, sword fighters sometimes try to pull a fient on you dodging your attacks and swiftly counterattacking for instance. If you try to cheese the game with a bow from a distance eventually your foes start to dodge them.\n\nThe foes seem to have a set distance at which they will engage you, the fights are a little slower paced which I don't mind since you have time to plan your next move and don't run out of space as easily.\n\nI found the level design to be nice and clever but far from flawless, there were some places where I felt a disconnect. For instance trying to telport from a ledge to an archer that has been harassing me but it would only allow me to teleport to this one specific little spot on the ground without any visual cues so I was sitting there for ages figuring out how to get there.\n\nI found the inventory system to be quite intuitive, though sometimes it sticks out like a sore thumb when interacting with objects beneath you.\n\nThe art style was beautiful despite the simple cartoony looking graphics. Looks pretty good in VR, I loved the god rays coming out of the windows early on in the game. The skyboxes can use some work though.\n\nThe puzzles I've encountered so far are nice, but very short and simple.\n\nIt is good that the developer added some measures against cheesing the game, like abusing your available space to access areas you should not be able to otherwise.\n\nAll in all, I would really recommend this game, it is worth a try even if you don't happen to like RPGs.", 'timestamp_created': 1462593136, 'timestamp_updated': 1462593292, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 5, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.547325074672698975', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22837176': {'recommendationid': '22837176', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198113742847', 'num_games_owned': 566, 'num_reviews': 47, 'playtime_forever': 218, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 162, 'last_played': 1504043404}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "Wow....what a game!

Bei der allgemeinen Preisbalance wo die VR Spiele liegen, hab ich lange hin und her überlegt. Mein alltime Fav. Game ist Dark Souls. Also wollte ich etwas zum erkunden, sowie ein brauchbares Kampfsystem. Vanishing Realms bietet sowas im kleinen. Das Kampfsystem KANN ordentlich genutzt werden, aber auch ein rumgefuchtel wie bei Wii-Titel führt zum Erfolgt und erledigten Gegner. Ich rate für die Immersion trotzdem ordentlich zu spielen, was den Spielspaß erhöht. Das Erkunden ist beim erstmal richtig richtig klasse, flacht aber beim erneuten Spielen schneller ab. Da nichts random platziert wird. Aber das ist okay, würde man jedem anderen Single-Playertitel auch nicht ankreiden. Jedoch wirkt ein erneuter Durchlauf, weniger spannend. Daher sei dies angemerkt.\nDer WoW-Look ist gut gewählt bei der momentanen Performance situation. Es verbreitet Stimmung, aber keine Panik beim erkunden der Gemäuer. Ein kleiner Jumpscare zum Anfang. Der aber wirklich nicht der rede wert ist ist auch dabei. Ich liebe Horrorfilme sowie Spiele, und das genannte Dark Souls hat natürlich auch viele solcher verstörenden Elemente. Jedoch wirkt in VR so etwas immer noch eine Ecke krasser und Intensiver. Daher bin ich froh, dass dieses Game nie zu dunkel oder zu furchteinflössend daher kommt. Es macht Spaß, sich eine Fackel zu greifen und hier und da ein bisschen Indiana Jones art die Gänge zu beleuchten, auch wenn dies nie notwendig ist. Da alles hell genug bleibt. Man macht es trotzdem und man fühlt sich wieder ein paar Jahre jünger und baut sich ein Spiel im Spiel damit. \n\nIch habe zu diesem Zeitpunkt den ersten Akt in gut einer Stunde durchgespielt. Was auch wirklich mein persönliches Limit war. \n- Das Erkunden (soweit möglich von meinem Wohnzimmer), funktioniert mit RoomSkaling und blinking bzw. teleportieren zu neuen Abschnitten kombiniert wirklich gut. Auch rückwärts, um sich platz zu schaffen, wenn Gegner vor einem stehen. Macht man dies zuu schnell verspürt man gerade gegen Ende ein wenig Übelkeit. Aber alles im Rahmen und verglichen mit dem, was ich mit dem Dev-Kit1 der OR damals durchgemacht habe. Ein Kinderspiel. Man ertappt sich dabei, wie man hier und dort unter Möbeln schaut und jede Ecke untersuchen möchte. Ob nicht doch noch irgendwo etwas versteckt ist.\n- Das Kämpfen funktioniert wie schon gesagt gut, kann aber auch in fuchtellei ausatmen. Gerade wenn man seine persönliche Pause machen will, bzw. einfach nur noch den Akt beenden will, weil man erschöpft ist. Die KI ist wirklich nicht der rede Wert, die Skelette fuchteln ein wenig, schreien dich an (perfekter Zeitpunkt um ins Auge zu stechen) und schwingen ihr Schwert aus 2 Richtungen. Ansonsten bleiben sie hinter ihren Schild und warten eher das man auf sie zu kommt. Was gut ist. Denn in VR wird vieles schnell hektisch: "Wo bin ich gerade im RL? Hoffentlich ist vor mir nicht der Fernsehr, kurz umschalten zur Kamera. Neu Positionieren. Kabel richten. Okay weiter gehts!" Solche Momente wird man hier alle 2 min erleben, gerade wenn man nur etwa 3x2 Meter platz hat. Ich habe fast meine Freundin aufm Sofa einmal getroffen. Gerade wenn man voll dabei ist. Oder nur ein paar Münzen sammeln will. Daher ist es gut, dass die Gegner eher passiv agieren und dem Spieler sehr viele Chancen bieten. Ich denke das ist ein guter Kompromiss, zwischen Spielspaß und Sicherheit.\n- Die Technik dahinter. Ich mag mich täuschen, aber ich glaube vieles ist Asset, was im Unitystore angeboten wird. Aber das macht mir nichts. Man muss den WoWartigen Look aber mögen. Dafür bleibt die Performance auch meist Stabil. Bei zu vielen Lichtquellen hatte ich hier und da ein zucken gesehen. Was aber auch an meiner 770 GTX (4gb vram) liegen kann. Die Eingaben funktionieren tadellos und man merkt, dass sich viele Gedanken gemacht wurden. Einzig das man nicht runterfallen kann, wenn man sich auf Kisten portet finde ich etwas schade. Aber eine Kleinigkeit. Was mich mehr stört ist das Speichersystem, was eher Checkpointartig funktioniert. Ich hatte mal einen Soundausfall und wollte Steam neu starten und stand wieder vor New Game. Tut nicht not. \n\n\nUnterm Strich möchte ich Jedem Vanishing Realms empfehlen, der einmal als Ritter Dungeons erkunden möchte. Die Spielzeit mag (momentan) kurz wirken und der Wiederspielwert gen Null. Jedoch muss man sich vor Augen führen, dass VR nach einer Stunde schon anstrengend ist. Ich denke Sessions werden niemals 4-6 Stunden in Angriff nehmen. Zumindest wenn man so aktiv agiert wie hier. Und auch wenn man nach einem mal Spielen alles gesehen hat, denke ich schaut man vielleicht hin und wieder noch mal rein, um ein paar Monster zu metzeln. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. Ich bin gespannt ob und was noch alles nachgeliefert wird. Aber es fühlt sich jetzt schon wie ein richtiges Spiel an, was das wichtigste erfüllt.

There's so many things I want to say about this game.  For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game.  I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer’s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything.\n\nWhen I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game.  When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game.  Heck, when I read books...I wanted them to be this game.  This game is not Morrowind or Diablo.  It's not any of those things.  This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic. \n\nIt has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game.  Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization.  This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG.  But it doesn't matter.  We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one.  This is as close as you can get right now.\n\nMy only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short.\n\nRemember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote?

I tested this game sitting down in a office desk chair and had to use my upper body to move. This game thankfully allows movement using the controller, teleporting you from one spot on the floor to another. You will need to have the HTC Vive in Room scaling mode to play this game and it was a bit of a challenge to play sitting down, but I will assure all the talking points will cover the universal approach and in no way will my reliability of a chair affect the opinion. That said, let us get to the main question. Is this RPG the grand attraction suited to introduce the functionality of the HTC Vive or is it another newcomer that might have gone on stage prematurely?\n\nThe dungeon and graveyard look astounding with a style similar to one of the latter Zelda games. Little cracks cover the walls and the wood bearings show off wear and tare. Skeletons are detailed beautifully with shields riddled with arrows and bruised dents in their armour. It really stood out the entire time I was playing it and I found myself more than once stopping to enjoy the atmosphere. It works very well to establish the mood, even if the actual inhabitants look more cartoonish than frightening. The music was a side note, painfully masked by the louder ambient noises of box hits, enemy strikes and arrow flings. I tried finding a way to change the volume, but I might have missed it. \n\nThe tutorial is a welcome feature and covers the basics such as moving and picking up items. The rest of the features are rather self explanatory except for maybe the wand usage which as of now can be annoying when you attempt to put it away only to blast yourself with it. Items range from health potions, torches, a pick axe, food and puzzle items. Gold, jewels, mana stones, ore (from mining) and chalices add to the currency system used to buy weapons and potions. There are also ruby chalices hidden throughout the dungeon to collect for an achievement, but it also provides gold and mana. It is simple enough to pick up items and the only issues with it are being close enough to reach, but with the teleport movement style I have not had an issue reaching anything. UI consists of slots that appear around your waist and include categories for weapons, potions, wand, bow and items. The item slot is a bit annoying when trying to grab certain items (have to go through each item until you get the one you need) and you cannot drop items. There is a limit to how many items you can carry so unless you stockpiled on fruits before grabbing the pick axe, you should be fine.\n\nCombat is a typical hack and slash standoff against skeletons and ghosts. As long as the enemy can see you and are in range, they will attempt to hit you as a group (space must be available to accommodate multiple melee so bottlenecking into a short gap is usually recommended). Weapons and a shield are either bought or found and weapons range from swords, bows (use off hand to pull back arrow), hammer or a wand (uses mana and you point, hold trigger and release). Dual wielding is possible as well as parrying to deal with melee hits, but the shield is crucial against arrows and moving is the only way to avoid fireballs. It is very simplistic in nature with the majority just being massive flailing of the controller, but it is recommended to time attacks and use movement to gain a upper hand. It can get very tiring during the fights later on. Death is not to harsh on the player at least. \n\nThe look and feel of the game cannot overcome the barren amount of content though. Going through the first level can take about 30-45 minutes if you are going slow and the arena style matches can keep that stretched to about an hour and fifteen. There is a total of 11 ruby chalices to collect and 33 ore spots to harvest for achievements, but all of this can be done in one pass if you look half-effort. It can be hard for some to make it the whole way in one play through with the forty plus monsters you so thankfully their is checkpoint saving, but if someone wants to play, they either start where you left off or erase the entire save and start from the beginning. Outside of this, there were some random moments I experienced missing frames and was kicked out of the game to the Vive menu (it started were I left off when I entered the app again). \n\nDuring my second play through, the game starting feeling like an endurance test over anything else. The simple wonder of discovering what was behind the next corner really helped keep the magic alive during the first play through. I still enjoyed the scenery, but when I already knew what to expect it just felt boring. With only about an hour of gameplay and little replay value, it is hard to recommend when other products have so much more meat on their bones.

The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat. \n\nThe melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion. \n\nThe game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.  \n\n8/10 for now.

Auch verhält sich der Gürtel manchmal etwas komisch, irgendwie scheint er manchmal die Taille entlang zu rutschen, aber das könnte auch daran liegen, dass ich meine 2 Sensorboxen noch nicht fest verankert und ausgerichtet habe.\n\nDas Laufen über die Teleportierfunktion ist auch sehr gut gelößt: Ich kann mich nicht einfach auf den nächsten Berg oder an einem Gegner vorbei teleportieren - leider kann ich aber einem Gegner entfliehen damit, da die Teleportation einfach viel schneller als jeder Gegner ist. Auch habe ich einen begrenzten Teleportastionsradius, der so ein bisschen die übliche "Schrittlänge" wiederspiegelt - man denke hier an Old-School Dungeonm Crawler wie Legend of Grimrock. Eine recht immersive Lösung, die Motion Sickness entgegenkommt.

That being said, this game is amazing. If you ever wanted to feel like you have been thrown into a Zelda game(literally), this is the game for you. Yes it is in early access and yes there are some minor issues like inventory management. But the came had way too many pros for such minor details to stop me. I played all of the Early Access content in one sitting, probably not a good idea, but I was addicted. It was one of the most immersive games in VR I have played so far. I didn't want to leave! Anyways here are some of the Pros and Cons I experienced, it may not be the same for everybody.\n\nPros++++++\n-Immersive gameplay\n- You get to hack and slash your enemies( or disintegrate them with fire!)\n- Different weapons to suit your gamestyle(Archer, Knight, and Mage all mixed into one person)\n- Fun exploration and beautiful artwork/surroundings\n- A little bit of puzzle solving but nothing difficult\n- You feel like you are actually wielding whatever weapon you choose!\n- Some fun trap elements\n- Addicting( I don't know if this is a pro or con)\n- Some fun mini-boss and boss battles\n\nCons- - - - - (take lightly, it is still early access)\n- Inventory system can be annoying. I wanted to navigate back to my torch but since I picked up practically everything I saw I had to spam my inventory until the correct item appeared.\n- You need an ample amount of space of at least 2m x 2m.( not a problem for me, but could be for those with small areas)\n- Not much else when it comes to cons.\n\nPersonal recommendation:  I wish some of the puzzles were a little more difficult to really add a challenge! (Again, still early access)\n\nWell all things aside I do recommend this game for those that love the dungeon crawling and puzzle solving games.

In Job Simulator for instance, if you hold a mug and put your hand through a table the mug is stopped by the table and your hand continues through. Not only should your sword be physically blocked by an enemy shield but there should be a momentum calculation as well. One of the primary differences of the Vive from the Wii is that the controllers are tracked 1:1, real momentum calculations are possible; otherwise the combat will just feel gimmicky.\n\nAnother criticism would be the dreadful inventory system which the developer has already said he is going address. \n\nThe environments look great and feel great in VR.

Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.\n- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there\'s vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It\'s just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the shit out of his strikes.\n- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.\n\nGeneral movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that\'s not so bad and can be turned off.\n\nSome minor quirks with how far monsters "back off" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that\'s still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way.\n\n', 'timestamp_created': 1461093699, 'timestamp_updated': 1461093699, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22521269': {'recommendationid': '22521269', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198002783329', 'num_games_owned': 477, 'num_reviews': 31, 'playtime_forever': 965, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 162, 'last_played': 1574487459}, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'Tried to bite an apple. 10/10', 'timestamp_created': 1461093151, 'timestamp_updated': 1461093151, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 4, 'votes_funny': 10, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.523078024387359619', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22516363': {'recommendationid': '22516363', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197993471695', 'num_games_owned': 206, 'num_reviews': 2, 'playtime_forever': 415, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 118, 'last_played': 1586549371}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "I'm reviewing this as an early access game.

I was sad when I finished this because I wanted more. \n\nIf people are complaining that they can just teleport almost inside, and the waggle the sword around then I feel like that is one them for now.  Hopefully the enemies will be pushed back in the future.  For now, you can just teleport in front of them and then trade blows, blocks, and dodges the way it was intended to be played.  At one point near the end when it gets kind of hectic, I accidentally grabbed my old sword instead of my shield.  I didn't have enough time to switch back so I was duel wielding swords for awhile, and that was a lot of fun trying to move around and strike twice every time I saw an opening.\n\nThe auto pause was a little annoying at first.

About 25 minutes into Gallery, I had to stop and request a refund....it feels bored to me walking around exploring looking at things solving puzzles are not my thing I guess. Maybe I don't like adventure games.  Then I play Vanishing Realms, holy shyt...this game put me in a beautiful place where I actually really feel I am walking in that world.  It reminds me of Zelda except that you're actually there and not looking at the 2d screen. The teleportation is perfect....it's easy and quick and intuitive.  I didn't like the one in Gallery's...I know there is an option to change it but i didn't bother.  Vanishing Realm's teleportation should be used as a default for EVERY VR game!! It is that good along with Budget's Cut.  I love the magic, text, words, voices of Vanishing Realm, they're engaging. When i picked up the sword, it brought a smile to my face...i am ACTUALLY holding a freaking sword!  I am now ready to beat someone up.  And when i picked up the shield....I feel more than ready for combat.  I begin to search and the first battle with the skeleton was mesmerizing...holy shyt, it's huge.  I feel overwelmed but safe because I have my sword and shield. This is no gimmick folks. Your skills in battle is based on your skills in real life lol.  It was intense and I was so into it that I even hit the wall.  I'm losing my mind. I have 15x15 space and it feels so good to get that bit of space.  I imagine people that have less space might feel frustrated because even I wish I have more space.  So those are the positives i have about the game.

You can pause the game but there is no option to save and I don't know if i lose the progress or not.  \n\nAnother thing i wish improvement is object collision.  I wish every objects in the world I hit with the sword make that collision sound.  It just feel satisfying to hit things with your sword.  If i drag the sword on the concrete, it should give me that feeling of how sword behaves in real life....with perhaps spark flying.  Anyway, these are just suggestions.

Playing this with the Vive versus looking at screenshots just does not do it justice. I was enjoying it so much I was unable to stop playing this until the game told me I was done, it\'s that good. It\'s definitely my favorite Vive game I\'ve played so far.\n\nWhat I loved:\n- Great sense of immersion\n- Great style\n- Writing (on pieces of paper throughout the game) was pretty entertaining to think about the meanings of and well written\n- Little touches - things like drawing the bow string back and getting a haptic tension feeling in the controller\n\nThings that I think could improve or at least considered by the devs:\n- Combat\nI didn\'t dislike the swordplay and shield stuff, but I felt like I was flailing a bit more than I would have liked to or felt immersive. I couldn\'t quite learn what was working against the enemies other than sheer flailing. I could get a cut around the head on the base skeleton warrior guys, but it was hard to replicate it time after time. Sometime I would get blocked. Using the bow and arrow was awesome and, when I was in a bind, would usually be a reliable strategy. Still I would love to be able to feel like I was a master of the swordplay.\n\nI was also wondering what sort of assumptions were made in the way the skeleton characters block that would be advantageous or disadvantageous to either a left or right handed player. I\'m not sure if it makes sense, but maybe have skeletons that are left or right handed so there\'s a chance to even that playing field a tad.\n\n- User interface\nIt would be great if there\'s an option to choose a left-handed inventory "belt" layout. As a lefty I was picking things up frequently with my left hand, but having to reach across my body to the end slot to put an item away. I\'m a pretty skinny person, but sometimes reaching and looking would cause the "belt" UI to shift over to the right on me, making it a bit more tedious to put the item away than it already was. It would be great as a lefty to just be able to put things away without having to stare too much at the slot.\n\n- Multiple item "belt" user interface\nIf a slot on the belt contains more than one item, maybe experiment with implementing a mechanic where the user can twist the controller once they\'ve activated a slot and then twisting would cycle backwards or forwards through the items in that slot. Another option might be to show the items in some sort of list that pops out once you\'ve activated that slot and moving the controller up or down moves through the items (only a few around the current one are shown)\n\nAll of those things said, I have to say this is the highlight game for me thus far on the Vive.

You get actually, physically fight monsters, the game is an absolute blast. The game isn’t without issue however.\n\nThe current implementation of teleportation is not as good as it could be. Adding an indication of where you are in your play space, similar to how The Lab handles it would be a great improvement. This wouldn’t change where you are and aren’t allowed to go; it just reduces the mental acrobats you need to go through in order to get where you want to go if you need to interact with an object. Not being able to drop objects is jarring. Yes, you need almost every item you are carrying, but sometimes I don’t want five apples on me when I’m looking for a torch or my pickaxe. The grip buttons aren’t used for anything currently, there’s your use. If the player drops a key object, maybe make the object flash, or give some other indication showing that they may need it. Overall the inventory could use some work, I don’t like having to cycle through my swords, just to get to the one I want.\n\nCombat is extremely entertaining, but as my friend discovered, you can win your fights by “Skyward Sword-ing” your way through them. Near the end of the game, he was just waggling his sword back and forth in the enemies’ hitbox, effectively stunlocking them and turning the fights into a joke. That said, if you fight how you would expect to handle a sword and shield, the combat feels awesome. The choice of giving the play a sword first instead of a shield feels odd. From what I’ve seen, the average player doesn’t try to parry until they are told they can, and that makes the first few fights very panicked. Possibly introducing the shield first, and having the players defend against arrows before being given a weapon would introduce the combat better. I’d love to be able to shield bash my enemies, maybe not doing much (if any) damage, but being able to stagger them would be nice. The magic staff, while useful for massive damage and an AOE attack, just doesn’t feel good to use, it shoots it’s fireball in a disappointingly short arc, and doesn’t have much sensation on use.\n\nThe AI isn’t the most advanced in the world but it does try to prevent you from performing the same combinations against it. After a few similar moves, the enemies will dodge your attacks or try to block them, and forces you to try a different attack angle or method. The giant skeleton enemies downward attack also seems like it might not be working as intended, where if the player is within range to be able to hit the giant, the monster’s attack never seems to connect, since the end of the flail lands so far behind the player. All of that said, Vanishing Realms is an absolute delight to play, the environments are varied enough that you know generally where you are in the world. Although the first map is actually quite small if you are racing through it and the second is just the same arena nine times.\n\nSince the game is in early access at the time of writing (April 9, 2016) I expect that the game will grow more over time, and the majority of its issues to get dealt with.', 'timestamp_created': 1460246417, 'timestamp_updated': 1460246417, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 1, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.504073441028594971', 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, '22327571': {'recommendationid': '22327571', 'author': {'steamid': '76561197968353457', 'num_games_owned': 161, 'num_reviews': 1, 'playtime_forever': 171, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 74, 'last_played': 1473533595}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "I...\nwent to another world, got in fights with skeletons, got lewt, punched a real life wall (on accident), and now have tennis elbow.

Only stab when you're sure you have enough room :D.

It's great for a first iteration, but I feel that there's some room for improvement. Larger enemies are immersion breaking for me since you need to get close to them to whack them, but then you have non-existant collision and clipping. And their attacks also make no sense then. Also, in general, blocking works well, but attacking feels off. You don't need finesse for some enemies, just randomly flail around and you're guaranteed to get some hits in.\n\nOh and I love the AI sometimes. When using a bow and arrow, they eventually start dodging your arrows, and at one point they just put their guard up so it's hard to get an arrow in. A great way to deal with cheese.

The Vive removes those layers of abstraction. Which button do I press to gaze at an enemy and block that fireball? Who cares! Just look at that archer and raise your shield. Is there an arrow flying at you? Physically dodge it or duck behind that stone column for cover. Need to restore your health? Pull the potion out of your inventory and drink it.\n\nThrough these natural actions, and augmented by the haptic feedback of the Vive motion controllers, we’re projecting a tangible sense of agency into the game world in a way that was previously impossible. And the world responds accordingly.\n\nDuring a particularly heated battle, I was fending off two flanking archers, a healer, and a spellcaster (make that healer a priority kill with your bow & arrow!) who were guarding the coveted Dragon Wand. I emerged sweaty and out of breath from hiding behind trees, popping out of cover, dodging arrows, and just getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment. When you start dual-wielding swords and fighting increasingly brawny boss monsters, Vanishing Realms can even turn into a legitimate workout if you get carried away.\n\nI can easily say without reservation that Vanishing Realms is a visceral, awe-inspiring VR experience steeped in intuitive, tactile gameplay. It has left me satisfied but selfishly craving more. That it was created by a single developer in 8 months is nothing short of extraordinary, and I believe this paves the way for a surge of successful, micro-sized development teams making breakout games for virtual reality."\n\nFull review with gameplay: http://uploadvr.com/vanishing-realms-rite-of-steel-early-access-review-roomscale-dungeon-crawling/', 'timestamp_created': 1459868351, 'timestamp_updated': 1459930169, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 75, 'votes_funny': 11, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.735800564289093018', 'comment_count': 11, 'steam_purchase': False, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}}
